1190229 theres a lot of traffic accidents theres a lot of vehicles around town and everybodys just running through the red lights
1190230 a flag not only of freedom for us but a symbol of freedom to all people
1190231 crude futures are down despite a brewing storm and that shows you how momentum has shifted in this market
1190232 despite all these bullish inferences a lower market must mean that participants have an infinitely greater concern about a deteriorating global economy
1190233 the biggest mistake we made was that we tried to make agreements
1190234 everybody had his own responsibility and then some people did not do what they promised
1190235 we wasted precious time by cutting rope from the bottom and bringing it up
1190236 if you cant go down you have to climb up
1190237 so in such a difficult situation you are taking more risks youre climbing more technical slopes and finally you make a little mistake and youre gone
1190238 people were running down but didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem
1190239 so actually everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody were leaving each other
1190240 i didnt have time to start discussion the only thing i had to do was to go down because if you go down you have more oxygen you have more chance to survive
1190241 the opening came 70 years after topekans first came by the thousands to celebrate the opening of the topeka avenue bridge but with temperatures reaching 100 degrees sunday the crowd at the ribbon cutting ceremony numbered in the hundreds not thousands the 51 1 million bridge opened to traffic at 10 p m sunday
1190242 spontaneously includes rep nancy boyda d kan in the performance sunday during the bridges opening
1190243 ryun voted against a bill in december 2003 that added 8 5 million in funding for the bridge and nearly 24 million for the 2nd district as a whole

1190247 it is a unique case of its kind in which a foreigner bangladeshi national not only illegally entered assam india but has also been merrily roaming around if his claim is to be believed he has also become a voter having his say not only in the making of the government but is also deciding the destiny of the nation
1190248 give a dangerous and gloomy picture of assam and india in the matter of unabated infiltration from bangladesh seriously telling upon the demographic pattern of society and the identity of the indigenous people of the state

1190250 president bushs visit to beijing almost looks like a vacation right down to a family reunion but his three nation asian trip also takes him to the doorsteps of two troublesome regimes while forcing him to balance the olympic spirit with the delicacies of diplomacy
1190251 the prospect for controversy at the olympics in beijing where bush is to arrive thursday has already been well documented
1190252 korean protesters angry about the resumption of u s beef imports are girding to hit the streets when bush arrives in seoul on tuesday night
1190253 political repression in neighboring burma will be high on bushs agenda in bangkok
1190254 burma will be a tricky one for bush in thailand said mike green a former asia adviser to bush who briefed reporters last week at the center for strategic and international studies
1190255 after coming into office with a confrontational stance toward a rising china and open belligerence toward north korea the bush administration has developed an asia policy that has lowered the temperature of some of the worlds toughest security threats experts in the region say
1190256 it never seemed like he was on the forefront of anything

1190264 congresswoman nancy boyda says she wants the democratic congressional campaign committee and other third party organizations making independent expenditures to political campaigns to keep out of the 2nd congressional district race in kansas the dccc as a third party is not associated with any candidates campaign and acts on its own
1190265 i told them to get out of my race but what can i do
1190266 in kansas if you position yourself as a moderate republican in the primary you may as well say im also on a suicide mission
1190267 once you get to the general thats something you may want to work on

1190275 the very wet east coast and adjacent inland this month was due to highly unusual low pressure systems forming off the queensland coast
1190276 normally dry westerly winds at this time of year keep east queensland rainfall at a minimum
1190277 over the next few months rainfall is set to decrease back below the long term normal over much of queensland
1190278 when you have divided party government you have more vigorous oversight
1190279 to assess the oversight of one year can take several years
1190280 it would be wrong to ascribe these accomplishments to the congressional hearings but without question those hearings in 1994 had a galvanizing effect
1190281 one thing that is clear is that there is a heckuva lot more oversight than there was before 2006
1190282 in a dispute about race the mccain campaign knows it will end up with the larger half
1190283 for the most part most white peoples experience with race isnt one of racial discrimination they can only relate to racial discrimination in the abstract what white people can relate to is the fear of being unjustly accused of racism this is the larger half this is why allegations of racism often provoke more outrage than actual racism because most of the country can relate to one the accusation of racism easier than the other actual racism for this reason in a political conflict over race the mccain campaign has the advantage because saying the race card has been played is actually the ultimate race card
1190284 white house officials repeatedly pressed fbi director robert mueller to prove it was a
1190285 they really wanted to blame somebody in the middle east
1190286 how to deploy and use these kinds of substances so you start to piece it all together
1190287 told us this was not something some guy in a cave could come up with
1190288 they couldnt go from box cutters one week to weapons grade anthrax the next
1190289 former fbi official after 9 11 white house told fbi to blame anthrax attacks on al qaeda
1190290 told us this was not something some guy in a cave could come up with
1190291 they couldnt go from box cutters one week to weapons grade anthrax the next
1190292 did the fbi meaningfully investigate who sent an anonymous letter to the fbi after the anthrax letters were sent but before they were made public accusing a former fort detrick scientist the arab american ayaad assaad of being a
1190293 prove it was a second wave assault by al qaeda
1190294 anthrax case yeah solved the guy responsible killed himself nothing else to see here move along move along
1190295 youve been infected vote no on legislation x to receive the antidote
1190296 after the anthrax scare makes me wonder if it truly had been weaponzied or was still rather crude
1190297 may be a remnant of the us biological weapons program
1190298 they take it really seriously when their top compliance officer and ceo are going to certify it
1190299 the government views the code almost like a best practice standard
1190300 the impact is going to be pretty significant more than pharmaceutical companies may initially anticipate
1190301 there are fairly significant changes to standard sales and marketing practices
1190302 theyre going to bear the burden for complying with these requirements and its going to entail making sure theyre very clear what the boundaries are for them
1190303 to ensure compliance with not only the letter but the spirit of the standards set forth in the new phrma code
1190304 i dont think someone is going to file a false claims act case because someone distributed reminder items it will be indicative of the compliance culture
1190305 if you dont have a phrma code compliance program you will be on the defensive with the oig to say why you dont
1190306 its original guidance but we do discuss the phrma code
1190307 although compliance with the phrma code will not protect a manufacturer as a matter of law under the anti kickback statute it will substantially reduce the risk of fraud and abuse and help demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with the applicable federal health care program requirements
1190308 the minimum phrma code standards and other relevant industry standards
1190309 now that the code has changed i dont think the oigs position towards phrmas position is going to change
1190310 prosecutors are on the front lines like federal agents they are the face of federal law enforcement
1190311 they are dealing with pretty dangerous people and have a legitimate gripe for the job they do they deserve more protection
1190312 it may sound like a small thing but its a big deal
1190313 i would endorse the concept of secured parking going to a public lot is an unnecessary risk youre a sitting duck
1190314 if you cant say anything nice dont say anything at all
1190315 a lawyer shall not make a statement that the lawyer knows to be false or with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity concerning the qualifications or integrity of a judge adjudicatory official or public legal officer or of a candidate for election or appointment to judicial or legal office
1190316 with knowledge of its falsity or in reckless disregard of whether it was false or true
1190317 if an attorneys activity or speech is protected by the first amendment the disciplinary rules governing the legal profession cannot punish the attorneys conduct
1190318 those circumstances characterize you the judge as a racist and bigot for racially stereotyping me as unable to be an attorney because i was black
1190319 i am entitled to and i affirm my right not to have my attorney fees determined by a racist judge your dilatoriness in recusing yourself is delaying determination of my fee by a replacement judge i want my fee determined promptly by another judge i need not remind you of the dilatoriness standard for judges
1190320 brought a complaint against the lawyer charging him with violating
1190321 the right of a lawyer as a citizen to publicly criticize adjudicatory officials is particularly meaningful where as in texas the adjudicatory officials are selected through the elective system
1190322 the judges have now made it eloquently clear where their sympathies lie in regard to aggressive vice investigations by refusing to authorize use of the das funds to pay for the cost of closing down the canal street clip joints this raises interesting questions about the racketeer influences on our eight vacation minded judges
1190323 made a variety of unsupported allegations against several judges attorneys court personnel and members of the public
1190324 either with actual knowledge of the falsity of said accusations or with reckless disregard of whether they were true or false
1190325 money is king and some judges feel they are there to see that it doesnt lose

1190332 i have always been deeply moved by patsy clines voice
1190333 this musical play happens in the 1960s not only is the music wonderful the characters are funny too
1190334 her voice is timeless when i tell people im doing a show about her the typical response is i love her my mom loved her and i grew up listening to her this is quite a surprising response from some of my friends considering their main genre of music is rock or hip hop
1190335 we had a wonderful childhood filled with dance music and performance
1190336 my first experience with patsys music was during my time as the lead singer in the tumbleweed band and i sang her songs
1190337 my parents saw always patsy cline in pittsburgh a few years ago
1190338 i was thrilled of course with the opportunity to portray such a strong fabulous woman mother and singer
1190339 contentions that brocade employees misled wsgr about stock option grants
1190340 wsgrs commitment to pay and its subsequent payment of a one time contribution in the amount of 9 5 million in recognition of and in order to defray some of the significant costs brocade has incurred over the past four years in connection with the various investigations and lawsuits relating to the companys historical stock option practices
1190341 after balancing the full array of considerations the slc has determined that pursuing claims against wsgr and mr sonsini would be inappropriate
1190342 brocade continues to be an important longstanding client and were glad that this is resolved
1190343 continues to have full confidence in wilson sonsini goodrich amp rosati as its outside counsel and we look forward to continuing that relationship
1190344 buried in the fine print is a conflict like no other while acting as counsel for nominal defendant brocade wsgr also acted as counsel for itself
1190345 im happy to see the slc is pursuing some of the claims that were made in my federal case
1190346 obviously i am disappointed that theyre not pursuing all defendants and claims in my case but its certainly a lot more than what cooley godward was proposing to do when they were in the case
1190347 it would seem to me they must have determined a factual background and factual predicate for their recommendation and finding that would be really a different kind and degree than most of the other cases
1190348 i am concerned that at some point people on the hill will start to ask why we have not been filling these ij vacancies as part of the administrations effort to ensure that illegal aliens who pose a danger to us are deported in an expeditious manner
1190349 it would be difficult if not impossible to see ex post facto if theyre qualified now
1190350 a 33 year old was able to rule the day
1190351 senior officials in these offices sometimes objected to goodlings decisions and argued with her about the quality of these candidates
1190352 sometimes their appeals were successful but more often they were not
1190353 although the publication of these reports and the headlines they generate are painful for all who work here
1190354 they are an important part of determining and acknowledging what went wrong and why it went wrong and crucial to ensuring that we do not again have to face such problems
1190355 we are reviewing the report and considering what if any actions should be taken based upon the findings contained in the report
1190356 we did not think there was a sufficient basis for criminal prosecution for false statements
1190357 the only witness in this whole affair who could and did recall
1190358 to meet the new standards well in advance of 2020
1190359 the industry has made a commitment to step forward and support these aggressive standards
1190360 i think we are going to be able to satisfy those requirements
1190361 does not have adequate resources or lead time to make major product changes across most or all
1190362 goal has always been to meet or exceed fuel economy requirements and that will not change
1190363 theyre playing the same old game of insisting they cant do it even though reality is hitting them in the face
1190364 its time for the auto makers to deliver fuel efficient cars trucks and suvs not deliver more excuses
1190365 rather than disposing of the body it was prepared to be eaten
1190366 one of the arguments is really if you want to punish your enemy killing them is not enough if you can chop them up and eat them and turn them into excrement that is the greatest humiliation you can impose on them
1190367 the amount of evidence is so overwhelming it would be unfair to pretend it didnt happen it is too important to ignore
1190368 it was definitely there its recorded in all sorts of ways in our histories and traditions a lot of place names refer to it
1190369 you will get your english based historians who come out of an english culture who dont understand it and avoid it because they dont understand it
1190370 if you dont understand it youre risking misinterpreting it badly if you try to address it
1190371 if you dont understand the things you are talking about you take one hell of a risk
1190372 very very hard for a pakeha to get it right on these things especially when they dont know how to interrogate it from within the culture and interrogating it from within the culture means interrogating it from within the language
1190373 there was a lack of willingness to address the big issue of population and consumption
1190374 many of us gave it a good try but try as we might we could not get recognition for the connection between our consumption levels
1190375 i do not know how he is a professor but anyway he purports to be an economist
1190376 the odd quiggan is good mental exercise all part of lifes rich tapestry et al
1190377 quiggin strikes me as the stereotype of an australian joyful hearty and not particularly aware of his own strength
1190378 his chief delight was drinking cups of coffee at odd hours
1190379 if only every jury in this country reacted to racism or bigotry the way this jury did we would have a much better jury system
1190380 stubborn rude stingy are thieves and have stolen other persons ideas
1190381 mattel believes that to declare a mistrial based on juror no 8s comment would be to penalize the jury for doing the right thing
1190382 we believe were entitled to a unanimous verdict of 10 impartial jurors
1190383 she expresses her shock and sense of humiliation over the entire incident
1190384 at stake here is property a lot of property at two oclock ill be taking cases where peoples life and liberty are at stake
1190385 consistent with this states strong policy against any form of discrimination in the workplace we hold that the threshold for demonstrating a religion based discriminatory hostile work environment cannot be any higher or more stringent than the threshold that applies to sexually or racially hostile work environment claims
1190386 even in a work setting in which derogatory humor was a norm the humor file defense fails to be dispositive of cutlers claim of hostile work environment
1190387 antagonistic degrading or demeaning conduct in the workplace that is directed at or about ones religious faith or ancestry can be discriminatory and can amount to an unlawful hostile environment
1190388 those statements were not accidental in parlance they were aimed to have an effect on their listener and their listener was known to the speakers as a person of jewish faith and ancestry the uttering of those repeated comments clearly constituted a form of harassment for the person whose ancestry and religion was being demeaned and insulted
1190389 the appellate division calls it teasing but that moniker undervalues the invidiousness of these stereotypic references and demeaning comments that were directed at cutler or said in his presence
1190390 one of the lowest times in mankinds history the holocaust
1190391 time and time again such inappropriate workplace cultures have given rise to liability for a hostile workplace
1190392 in sum the comments demonstrated an anti semitic bigotry that has no place in a workplace of this state
1190393 you cant make a joke in the workplace even if its not mean spirited
1190394 the court is really raising the bar for workplace standards even if a joke is made in jest thats a hostile work environment
1190395 critical step forward in protecting jewish workers in new jersey
1190396 reaffirms the commitment of the new jersey supreme court to ensuring that anti semitism has no home in the new jersey workplace
1190397 in the end while the court made it clear that religion related comments are impermissible it did not disturb the finding that jason cutler suffered no damages
1190398 me d cuenta c mo una revoluci n puede cambiar la visi n de un pueblo
1190399 this incident is an excellent example of the results of continued training and coordinated response of fire based emergency medical care within navy fire and emergency services
1190400 all firefighters train continuously and responded to over 3 000 incidents last year enabling them to utilize their skills although the fire station atmosphere may appear casual on the surface its all business when it comes to an emergency
1190401 the focus is putting in place a high quality practice
1190402 my belief is profitability follows that so its not a goal but its a result
1190403 is a great guy and we wish him the best in the future
1190404 a reasonable jury could find that pavanes statement indicates that 1 he holds stereotypes that women should be sweet and non aggressive and 2 that pavane believed that plaintiff did not fit this stereotype
1190405 just a ranting of somebody who is looking to set you up for litigation
1190406 you the men and women of naval base san diego have successfully safeguarded your people and safeguarded your resources to preserve and enhance your readiness
1190407 safety is a core value taking care of yourself and your shipmates
1190408 my staff takes great pride in providing the best possible customer service
1190409 the accolades and accomplishments would not be possible without the support and cooperation of every person residing at the nbsd command
1190410 me d cuenta c mo una revoluci n puede cambiar la visi n de un pueblo
1190411 las leyes que fueron consideradas org nicas fueron enviadas al tribunal supremo de justicia ste se pronunci sobre la constitucionalidad del car cter org nico de ellas y posteriormente fueron entonces publicadas en gaceta oficial
1190412 me d cuenta c mo una revoluci n puede cambiar la visi n de un pueblo
1190413 material objects in which a work is fixed by any method and from which the work can be reproduced
1190414 fixed in a tangible medium of expression when its embodiment is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be reproduced for a period of more than transitory duration
1190415 given that the data reside in no buffer for more than 1 2 seconds before being automatically overwritten we believe that the copyrighted works here are not embodied in the buffers for a period of more than transitory duration and therefore are not fixed in the buffers
1190416 in the case of a vcr it seems clear and we know of no case holding otherwise that the operator of the vcr a person who actually presses the button to make the recording supplies the necessary element of volition not the person who manufactures maintains or if distinct from the operator owns the machine
1190417 we do not believe that an rs dvr customer is sufficiently distinguishable from a vcr user to impose liability as a direct infringer on a different party for copies that are made automatically upon that customers demand
1190418 unfettered discretion in selecting the programming that it would make available for recording
1190419 sufficiently proximate to displace the customer as the person who makes the copies when determining liability under the copyright act
1190420 seems to us more relevant to the question of contributory liability
1190421 open to the public or at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered
1190422 we must examine the potential audience of a given transmission by an alleged infringer to determine whether that transmission is to the public
1190423 and because the rs dvr system as designed only makes transmissions to one subscriber using a copy made by that subscriber we believe that the universe of people capable of receiving an rs dvr transmission is the single subscriber whose self made copy is used to create that transmission
1190424 does not generally permit content delivery networks to avoid all copyright liability by making copies of each item of its content and associating one unique copy with each subscriber to the network or by giving their subscribers the capacity to make their own individual copies
1190425 we do not address whether such a network operator would be able to escape any other form of copyright liability such as liability for unauthorized reproductions or liability for contributory infringement
1190426 weve always believed that under existing copyright law the remote storage dvr is no different than traditional dvrs that are in use today
1190427 were obviously pleased with the courts decision which is a significant victory for consumers and will allow cable providers to deliver this popular dvr technology faster and much more efficiently
1190428 we respectfully disagree and are considering the appropriate next steps
1190429 we were very concerned that the lower courts decision would have the potential to chill innovation in any number of products that use todays networking capabilities to provide storage and functionality at remote locations
1190430 it seemed the lower court attached a lot of significance to the physical location of the storage and thats a real problem because in a networked world in which increasingly all kinds of devices and services connect to the internet there shouldnt be any reason for people not to use
1190431 the buffering issue is really not just about cablevisions system but much more generally a victory for the publics right to access and use digital information
1190432 este es el m s vivo ejemplo de lo que significa darle poder al pueblo porque son nuestros coordinadores ind genas los que trabajan directamente con las comunidades a trav s de los consejos comunales y con el aval de las autoridades leg timas de cada sector ind gena
1190433 los productores van a poder tener espacios agr colas maquinaria e infraestructura pues se ampliar n los plazos del cr dito y disminuir el impacto para los productores
1190434 esta nueva ley aumenta las multas que van a recibir las entidades bancarias que no cumplan con la gaveta pues es una prioridad para el estado la inversi n en alimentos ni siquiera le decimos a quien le debe dar el cr dito pero hay grandes productores y centros de acopio agr colas que han sido tradicionalmente excluidos y por los cuales le pedido a la banca que los incorpore y les de una prioridad para el financiamiento
1190435 es una prioridad para el estado otorgar recursos para la producci n de alimentos de nuestro pueblo por eso estamos seguro que debemos seguir trabajando con estos bancos y a trav s de la superintendencia nacional del bancos sudeban se incrementar n los mecanismos de control para multar a las entidades que no cumplan con la medida obligatoria de entregar cr ditos a los productores
1190436 here plaintiff claims that he was compelled to settle his chancery action because the negligence of defendant deprived him of the proofs he needed to prevail
1190437 the parties deem this settlement to be fair and reasonable and have arrived at this settlement in arms length negotiations taking into account all relevant factors present or potential
1190438 we consider plaintiffs claim that defendant was negligent in representing plaintiff in connection with the transaction to be encompassed within the phrase taking into account all factors past or potential which modifies the statement that the settlement was fair and reasonable
1190439 certainly at this stage of the proceedings plaintiff was entitled to have the sentence interpreted to mean that he considered the settlement reasonable in light of the apparent weaknesses in his case and not that he considered 325 000 a fair and reasonable estimate of his interest in both companies
1190440 he was never issued shares in the one corporation and the agreement never took into account his sweat equity
1190441 were disappointed that the appellate division did not agree with the trial courts determination that
1190442 me d cuenta c mo una revoluci n puede cambiar la visi n de un pueblo

1190446 cada quien debe hacer su trabajo para tratar de cambiar las cosas y mantener este proceso espero que no nos despertemos un

1190452 su funci n de rector en el rea generador de las pol ticas de defensa y tutela de la fuerza armada desde el punto de vista administrativo la fuerza armada pasa a agruparse bajo un comando estrat gico operacional que estar adscrito administrativamente al ministerio de la defensa pero depender de forma operacional al comandante en jefe de la fan tal como est establecido incluso en la anterior constituci n nacional y en la vigente
1190453 para esto despu s de un estudio se divide el territorio en un n mero de zonas de defensa integral en las cuales estar n todos los elementos que conforman la fuerza armada nacional organizados en zonas y reas dependiendo del nivel pero bajo un comando que se encargar de planificar la defensa integral y contribuir al desarrollo de la regi n

1190455 los oficiales efectivos estar n conformados por los oficiales de comandos y t cnicos el plan prev que se conviertan en oficiales t cnicos los actuales suboficiales profesionales de carrera esto ser mediante un proceso que comienza hoy mismo con la promulgaci n de la ley
1190456 despu s de cuatro meses que se hayan fijado las normas comienza el propio proceso de transici n que se prolongar por un m ximo de 5 a os es decir 4 meses para fijar las normas a partir de ahora y luego 5 a os para que se materialice el proceso
1190457 ya no existir el aerot cnico ni tampoco el distinguido equivalente a sargento la primera jerarqu a para la tropa profesional ser la de sargento segundo

1190464 appellant was required to establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in certain peremptory challenges made by the commonwealth before the commonwealth was required to provide race neutral reasons for those challenges
1190465 once the commonwealth provided such reasons the burden returned to appellant to dispute the persuasiveness of those reasons after deeming mcmahons explanations both race neutral and credible the court concluded that t he defendant had failed to carry the burden of showing that the prosecutor exercised his peremptory challenges in a discriminatory manner therefore it is clear that the pcra court properly applied the burden shifting framework of the u s supreme courts decision in batson v kentucky and appellants allegation of analytical error is meritless
1190466 if you go in there and any one of you think youre going to be some noble civil libertarian and try to get jurors well he says he can be fair ill go with him thats ridiculous
1190467 examining whether the courts findings of fact are supported by the record and whether its legal conclusions are free of error
1190468 pretextual race neutral explanations for a race based peremptory strike
1190469 i believe that mcmahons recorded admissions concerning consistently applied unconstitutional practices and impermissible attitudes toward jury selection raise the question of whether there is any basis to believe that he experienced some change of heart that could have caused him to alter his approach to jury selection between the time he made the tape and the trial in the present case
1190470 to me his comments were more in the nature of an attempt to recast or explain away and there is simply no evidence of the necessary watershed change
1190471 some judges find it significant that there are some peremptory challenges that mcmahon simply cannot explain and some do not likewise some judges attach a high degree of relevance to the fact that mcmahon arguably engaged in disparate treatment of african american and caucasian prospective jurors in a specific case and some do not
1190472 occurred in the context of a retrospective examination of prosecutor motive
1190473 prosecutor who is required to explain peremptory challenges that happened many many years ago is not reasonably going to be held to the same standard
1190474 i entered upon al ma moon so he said how have you awoken oh nidr so i said in goodness oh ameer al mu mineen he asked

1190490 the goal of the operation is to seek out and destroy criminal elements and terrorist threats in diyala and eliminate smuggling corridors in the surrounding area
1190491 it will continue until we destroy al qaeda the militias and the outlaws in the province
1190492 we hope this operation will be 100 percent successful we hope it will be the death blow for al qaeda and the militias that want to destroy the province

1190504 the agenda is broad and so all types of entities will be looked at in this review
1190505 the non profit sector is a very big and important part of this particularly since we have had a lot of changes in welfare benefits and their interface with tax
1190506 we dont have a single regulatory system or uniform accounting standards and so it makes it confusing for the public to know who to trust or who is efficient
1190507 there are 700 000 not for profit organisations and the latest fad today is under 30s wanting to start their own not for profit equivalent of what in my day was starting a rock band
1190508 there are also a lot of celebrities and sports stars setting up charities in their own name or naming it after their child these have a lot of overheads and it isnt fair on the ato to have to regulate this
1190509 i would much prefer the warren buffett way who decided to put his money in with bill gates to me that is much more impressive than someone having their own name on a charity
1190510 there needs to be a review of the sector because it lacks transparency and the accounting standards need to be streamlined
1190511 there are 700 000 organisations in the non profit sector it is too many you have 2000 charities that have at least one of their goals tackling breast cancer this is inefficient and so i think the idea of a charities commission should be explored
1190512 we need to look at taxation for charities who does and doesnt get the gift recipient status
1190513 a secret terrorist organization has been working within to destroy america its constitution and everything for which she stands
1190514 the very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies to secret oaths and to secret proceedings
1190515 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but morally treasonable to the american public
1190516 drunk with power we the u s are leading the world to hell in a new colonialism with the same old human slavery which once ruined us to a third world war which will ruin the world
1190517 the policy from the white house has been to allocate funds to religious institutions even those that channel those funds exclusively to their own particular group of believers in a particular religion
1190518 as a traditional baptist ive always believed in separation of church and state and honoured that premise when i was president and so have all other presidents i might say except this one
1190519 we negroes believe in the god of ethiopia the everlasting god god the son god the holy ghost the one god of all ages that is the god in whom we believe but we shall worship him through the spectacles of ethiopia
1190520 men occasionally stumble over the truth but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing ever happened
1190521 the notion that the church the press and the universitiesshould serve the state is essentially a communist notion in a free society these institutions must be wholly free which is to say that their function is to serve as checks upon the state
1190522 wolves are wolves even if you choose to pretend they are chickens
1190523 he who does not remember history is condemned to repeat it
1190524 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
1190525 ecclesiasticism without christianity the discipline of a monastic rule not for gods sake or in order to achieve personal salvation but for the sake of the state and for the greater glory and power of the demagogue turned leader this was the goal for which the systematic moving of the masses was to lead
1190526 the illusion of freedom in america will continue as long as its profitable to continue the illusion at the point where the illusion becomes too expensive to maintain they will just take down the scenery they will pull back the curtains they will move the tables and chairs out of the way and you will see the brick wall at the back of the theater
1190527 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross
1190528 remember the inquisition it wont be long before the fires are ignited all over again
1190529 either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
1190530 it is time for protestants to go to the shepherd the pope and say what do we have to do to come home
1190531 we will get a new world order we may not get it in our generation but if we do not get it in our generation we will get it in the next generation
1190532 the allegations are serious ones and the standard of proof required reflects this knowingly providing false or misleading information is a significant test
1190533 firstly what is in question is whether a debtor creditor relationship actually existed if it did then it is not unreasonable to assume that the member knew or ought to have known and should have disclosed a debt and the name of any other person who may have discharged it
1190534 secondly if a debtor creditor relationship did not exist was a gift received and was the name or the donor known or reasonably discernible or was a donation made that covered expenses in an election campaign
1190535 high public interest and the impolications for the reputation of members and the institution of parliament
1190536 happy birthday to barack obama and happy re birth to america its coming america
1190537 this is the year that we will change new hampshire for a generation
1190538 even though we have lots of paid staffers we need real people talking to their neighbors
1190539 because instead of actually increasing americas domestic oil supply this is how obama thinks americans should try to alleviate burdensome pain at the pump
1190540 the duty of state government is to serve and protect people our first job is making sure we are serving the public and are available to the public the state director of personnel is currently reviewing telecommuting policies with that goal in mind and we would consider any proposals for a four day week in the same vein
1190541 the duty of state government is to serve and protect people our first job is making sure we are serving the public and are available to the public the state director of personnel is currently reviewing telecommuting policies with that goal in mind and we would consider any proposals for a four day week in the same vein
1190542 there are a lot more complicated issues than just copyright or trademark there are more complex issues than those in respect to the end user licensing agreement and antitrust issues come into play too
1190543 you agree not to install use or run the apple software on any non apple labeled computer or to enable others to do so
1190544 but take a look at the web site of the lead attorney representing apple
1190545 they came to us i think because this is a much bigger issue than just copyright
1190546 theres the fact that we are in the jurisdiction of the u s district court for northern california but weve also tangled with apple before weve dealt with apple so were familiar with the courts and the parties
1190547 what psystar might say is what we would like to do is use the mac operating systems unique features more broadly on a variety of hardware
1190548 i think its a very very hard argument to make but i wouldnt be surprised if they tried
1190549 my guess is that they will mount some kind of direct attack on apples exclusive licensing

1190569 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example 2 oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1190570 at these high injected doses we hoped to see drug like activity that might be useful in cancer treatment
1190571 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1190572 clinical and pharmacokinetic studies conducted in the past 12 years showed that oral ascorbate levels in plasma and tissue are tightly controlled in the case series ascorbate was given orally and intravenously but in the trials ascorbate was just given orally it was not realized at the time that only injected ascorbate might deliver the concentrations needed to see an anti tumor effect

1190575 ministers need to tell us what they are doing with this 100m a year taken from motorists
1190576 how much is actually put back into practical road safety that does not involve speed cameras ministers failure to answer that question confirms the view that for this government the british motorist is a nice little earner
1190577 is labour using speeding tickets just to raise revenue rather than making our roads safer using speed cameras as a cash cow undermines public confidence
1190578 the government needs to rethink ways of improving road safety including cracking down on uninsured drivers
1190579 safety cameras are there to save lives not make money
1190580 independent research has shown there are 1 745 fewer deaths and serious injuries at camera sites each year
1190581 the government is clear that the best safety camera is the one which takes no fines at all but succeeds in deterring drivers from speeding

1190674 lo que uno puede hacer es agudizar la selecci n en los jueces mejorar los procedimientos mejorar la reforma edilicia ahora las conductas edilicias
1190675 l dijo que era una cuesti n de humanidad por que ten a cinco hijos y porque la mujer hab a tenido una ces rea
1190676 por humanidad a ese caso individual no mir el contexto de 39 millones de argentinos y me parece que cuando las decisiones judiciales focalizan solo en el caso individual y no en el contexto general siempre va haber equ vocos
1190677 la preocupaci n es tratar de que mes a mes vayamos haciendo un avance de c mo va la causa schiavo
1190678 la verdadera batalla es por la igualdad de oportunidades en nuestros pueblos
1190679 nadie es perfecto yo tampoco soy una mujer de carne y hueso una mujer simple con responsabilidades mayores
1190680 nadie tiene derecho a ser condenado a vivir en la pobreza solo por haber nacido pobre
1190681 los hombres y mujeres elegidos democr ticamente hoy tenemos el desaf o de luchar contra la pobreza la desigualdad y la inequidad social lo debemos hacer a trav s de las ideas aquellas que cada uno de nosotros tenemos acerca de que pa s y en que mundo queremos vivir
1190682 esos que crecen y pueden tener m s riquezas es necesario que den un poco de esa riqueza a los que solitos no pueden salir del hambre la pobreza y el dolor
1190683 el crecimiento econ mico no ha llegado a todas partes el estado tiene que ir ah donde todav a hay dolor pobreza donde falta educaci n y salud para reparar para dar equidad
1190684 i dont care what my hubby says about my makeup obsession im boosting the economy
1190685 im willing to admit that ive been going through a very bad time with depression
1190686 ive finally decided to get professional help its not something that blossomed up overnight im on medication trying to get better
1190687 ive really had a lot on my mind really been contemplating a lot of things
1190688 in the state that im in had he reported i would be at training camp physically but mentally i could have gotten myself hurt or gotten one of my teammates hurt
1190689 after finally deciding to get professional help i felt like maybe talking about my situation could be a blessing to someone else going through the same things
1190690 regardless of whether youre a celebrity or you play for the philadelphia eagles and youre in the limelight you still go through problems
1190691 football is important its a means to an end but my mental health i feel like is a lot more important
1190692 thats a helluva lot of money moneys good moneys a necessity but its not everything i cant put a price tag on my mental state
1190693 but with some trepidation i think that there are two sectors worth considering reits real estate income trusts and precious metal stocks
1190694 the maximum exposure you should allow for this asset class is 15 of your stock component
1190695 hay negociaciones abiertas aunque todav a no est n cerradas aunque podr a estar todo cerrado ma ana mismo
1190696 es muy ruin tener que ver a trav s de la televisi n los partidos de la selecci n ol mpica
1190697 mi deseo era estar con el resto del equipo en pek n pero el real madrid no me liber para ello lo lamento mucho
1190698 it was hot but we got a lot done we need to do a better job finishing because we got a little sloppy the last couple of periods we are all looking forward to going to full pads tomorrow
1190699 we continue to see the freshman class show they have a chance to make a contribution this year i have been pleased with all four of our freshman safeties
1190700 albelda est rindiendo a muy buen nivel y su comportamiento en los entrenamientos es excepcional
1190701 os est is adelantando porque si ya os dais por satisfechos estar is ayudando muy poco a nuestro pa s de hecho est is limitando nuestras posibilidades est bien que tu pa s te admire pero es mucho mejor que el mundo admire a tu pa s no crees
1190702 este es un mensaje para todos mis fans en espa a para los periodistas que han elogiado mi viaje desde sant boi a estados unidos para los que han comprado la camiseta con el n mero 16 tambi n a la gente que me ha felicitado por mi nuevo empleo en los angeles muchas gracias por todo
1190703 esta es mejor selecci n de la historia al margen de lo hagan en pek n
1190704 podemos competir contra cualquiera pero el d a del primer cruce te lo juegas todo esa es la clave por eso ser importante evitar a francia y a croacia en cuartos
1190705 si defendemos bien tendremos contragolpe y eso por nuestra forma de jugar es fundamental hemos trabajado mucho en ese apartado
1190706 i never gave up in my life i am surely not going to give up now
1190707 everything was going well to camp four and on summit attempt everything went wrong
1190708 we were astonished we had to move it that took of course many many hours some turned back because they did not trust it anymore
1190709 soy deportista y amo el deporte por eso quiero divertirme viendo deporte
1190710 es rid culo que un presidente se comporte como si fuera un mero fan del deporte
1190711 you know we see rodney as a starter hes a sixth starter
1190712 we have a young group and if we continue to develop them and add their playing time to our starters i see us having a chance to be really good right now and on down the road even if we keep the nucleus the way it is right now
1190713 para mi lo m s importante es que hemos ganado en casa y que el equipo est en ascensi n y en un buena l nea el gol sigue siendo secundario porque soy un portero y ya he jugado m s de 800 partidos en mi club estoy m s feliz en ver c mo mis compa eros se esforzaron y c mo est n implicados
1190714 no es un golpe psicol gico porque yo no pienso como mourinho
1190715 no necesito ganar para estar seguro de lo que hago a veces un bofet n no va mal
1190716 estoy en italia para entrenar no para hacer una guerra dial ctica quiero hacerlo bien con el inter lo mejor posible para nosotros y olvidar el trabajo de los dem s
1190717 tiene raz n con lo que dice yo soy muy exigente conmigo mismo y necesito ganar para tener seguridad de las cosas por eso he ganado tantos t tulos a lo largo de mi carrera el en cambio tiene la mentalidad de alguien que no tiene la necesidad de ganar porque a sus casi setenta a os ha ganado s lo una supercopa y una copa es demasiado viejo para cambiar de mentalidad
1190718 vi ndole trabajar con los otros jugadores me ha hecho ver que se trata de un futbolista especial para m es una motivaci n extra ayudar a un chico como l a hacer algo especial en su carrera se habla mucho sobre kak que ha ganado el bal n de oro de messi y de ronaldinho pero trabajando tres d as con ibrahimovic me quedo con l
1190719 dentro de nuestras rutinas diarias hay un sinf n de situaciones en las que obtenemos nueva informaci n a trav s de reuniones avisos conferencias eventos navegaci n por la web o incluso cuando miramos vidrieras en lugar de ir a casa y hacer una b squeda web general para encontrar esa informaci n esta tecnolog a que apodamos pensive ayuda al cerebro a recordar datos cotidianos que normalmente se olvidan
1190720 esta es la primera vez que una red social a escala planetaria ha logrado validar la teor a de los seis grados de separaci n
1190721 si uno mira las posibilidades parece que puede ganar las ocho medallas de oro
1190722 puedes hacer lo que quieras simplemente t mate tiempo para ti si no perder s concentraci n
1190723 liu soportar mayor presi n que robles ya que compite en casa y las expectativas del p blico chino son muy grandes y todo eso le puede afectar
1190724 no importa la energ a que tenga robles porque seguramente se sentir fatigado despu s de las intensas competiciones que ha tenido que realizar
1190725 toda mi preparaci n va perfectamente y s lo que tengo que hacer en los juegos quiero el oro
1190726 mi sue o es colgarme una medalla la que sea en pek n
1190727 el torneo de nanjing nos hizo bien y mejoramos algo aunque todav a nos falta estos d as que nos faltan antes del debut nos vendr n muy bien para mejorar algunas cosas
1190728 no s si estamos a la altura de lituania espa a y rusia que son selecciones muy competitivas pero lo bueno es que acortamos diferencias y despu s del diamond ball estamos mejor
1190729 estados unidos est mejor que el resto de los equipos un paso por delante
1190730 esta es mejor selecci n de la historia al margen de lo hagan en pek n
1190731 las sensaciones est n siendo extraordinarias el equipo va a m s cada d a y demostrando un gran nivel hay mucho talento en el campo se ve un gran sacrificio mucha intensidad sobre todo en los entrenamientos y este es el nico camino del que nunca vamos a negociar salirnos
1190732 cuando volvamos a barcelona tendremos muy pocos d as para preparar este compromiso y con el agravante de que deberemos trabajar sufriendo los efectos del jet lag por el largo vuelo largo de regreso
1190733 sinceramente no me espera que pudi ramos hacer tantos goles si bien yo me quedo con otro aspecto la facilidad con la que creamos ocasiones de gol eso me gusta mucho porque demostramos que somos capaces de hacerlo por eso si otro d a no las creamos quedar n retratados
1190734 en los ltimos partidos hemos regalado dos goles se refiere al fallo de gudjohnsen en florencia y el de alves en chicago y eso debe ser un toque de atenci n para todos as que es algo de lo que tendremos que hablar para evitar que vuelta a ocurrir
1190735 le conozco casi como si fuera su padre he trabajado con l todo un a o s de sus cualidades y por eso no tengo la menor duda de que si un d a necesitemos que nos ayude nos ayudar de momento sin embargo estar con el filial
1190736 para m y para todos los jugadores ser a algo hermoso ganar vinimos a ganar la medalla de oro vamos a ir despacito y ojal lo podamos conseguir
1190737 lo que hice fue lo que ten a que hacer esperemos que esta situaci n no se repita m s
1190738 batista me entendi y mis compa eros tambi n ellos no tuvieron ning n problema en esperarme
1190739 la asociaci n con malaria no more es el ltimo esfuerzo humanitario del fc barcelona que entre 2006 y 2011 va a renunciar a unos ingresos potenciales de 20 millones de d lares por temporada debido al patrocinio de unicef en la parte frontal de sus camisetas
1190740 lo que pido es que dejen jugar a los futbolistas merecen respeto cuando sus selecciones les piden que jueguen en ellas
1190741 estoy un poco sorprendido por la postura tan fuerte adoptada por los clubes no s lo contra la fifa sino tambi n contra los jugadores
1190742 protecci n a los jugadores pues sin ellos no hay espect culo
1190743 joan laporta siempre dijo que incluso si la decisi n fuera a favor dejar a al jugador participar en los juegos
1190744 id fuerte a la pelota que el campo est muy lento
1190745 vamos abidal hay que llegar bien a esos balones y ponerla bien
1190746 cuando el extremo se va el interior se mete sigue la jugada
1190747 boji est s en fuera de juego hay que controlar eso
1190748 eso es rafa mejor un toque que dos muy bien
1190749 el pivote juega con el que va de cara puede elegir extremo o interior vosotros eleg s
1190750 cuando el mediocentro tiene el bal n t te abres no le cierras el espacio

1190753 carefully reviewed the available evidence to measure the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer and could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1190754 at this point we recommend that men concerned about prostate cancer talk with their health care providers to make a decision based on their individual risk factors and personal preference

1190756 i think that weve proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so no i dont believe in gay adoption
1190757 ich habe den spielplan des teams und von real madrid studiert und bemerkt dass es eine physische berforderung w re f r beide teams zu spielen
1190758 toda mi familia ha jugador en el bar a mi padre adolf yo mismo y la verdad es que poder volver ahora que creo que me he convertido en un jugador importante es bello la familia est contenta pero sobre todo mi padre tengo muchas ganas de hacer cosas bonitas en el bar a de una vez para siempre
1190759 los dos a os en girona me han servido para crecer y para poder demostrar que soy un jugador v lido para la liga acb que puedo jugar en el barcelona
1190760 hab a el tema del girona que desgraciadamente no continuar en la acb y ha acabado mal se han tenido que seguir los plazos que marcaron ellos y ahora ya soy blaugrana y respiro en blaugrana otra vez en estos momentos las sensaciones son muy buenas ahora que se ha hecho efectivo el fichaje estoy m s tranquilo porque parec a que nunca iba a cerrarse pese a que todo el mundo lo daba por hecho ten a que esperar a que se hiciera y ahora ya estoy tranquilo y con ganas de comenzar
1190761 cuando me estaba planteando la posibilidad de volver llam a juan carlos navarro para que me diera su opini n y volvimos a hablar del tema cuando coincidimos en la selecci n la verdad es que es muy bonito poder volver a la casa que te vio comenzar en esto del baloncesto tanto juan carlos como yo tenemos muchas ganas de volver y comenzar a jugar de nuevo con el bar a
1190762 es cierto que la gente habla de ganar t tulos y de llenar el palau pero es preciso ir paso a paso
1190763 de momento los nombres que se han fichado son muy buenos pero pienso que lo m s importante no son los nombres sino c mo nos complementemos dentro y fuera de la pista una vez superemos los dos primeros meses veremos cu l es el potencial real de este equipo en girona siempre fuimos paso a paso no mirando m s all del siguiente partido y la verdad es que no nos fue nada mal lo que est claro sin embargo es que aqu es un poco distinto por la presi n y la exigencia de los grandes t tulos que tiene el bar a
1190764 antes de fichar y despu s de hacerlo pude hablar con l creo que es suficientemente importante saber lo que el entrenador piensa de t y a la vez t expresar tu opini n el ya estaba aqu en mi ltima poca en el bar a durante la etapa de dusko ivanovic y siempre ha sido una persona muy clara creo que puede hacer un papel muy bueno en el bar a

1190772 este a o soy mucho m s feliz sin duda no recuerdo ni una carrera en la que kovalainen haya ido con menos gasolina que hamilton en hockenheim se apart para que pasara hamilton a m me tocar a estar haciendo ese papel ahora
1190773 su opini n es su opini n y yo no voy a darla sobre lo que haga o diga fernando s lo quiero decir que heikki es un chico honesto que intenta convencer a los que trabajan con l y que en el equipo siempre ha imperado el criterio de igualdad
1190774 s lo hace falta hacer un repaso a la historia de mclaren pod is hablar con cualquier piloto que haya estado en este equipo y no encontrar is a ninguno excepto a uno que no confirme que el equipo siempre ha estado basado en el principio de igualdad
1190775 s lo hay un piloto que no reconozca la igualdad en mclaren

1190796 as you can see from the dull grey green color of the sky we have been preparing for the games for some time
1190797 for years people in the west have been badgering us about improving security and dealing with our pollution problems but all along weve been using one problem to solve the other we are so damned clever it hurts sometimes

1190799 santiago vasconcelos va prendre la decisi de retirar se de la instituci a la qual ha entregat el seu talent i energia durant els ltims 20 anys de la seva vida per iniciar nous projectes personals i professionals

1190802 we can and should increase our domestic production of oil and natural gas but we should start by telling the oil companies to drill on the 68 million acres they currently have access to but havent touched and if they dont use it they should lose it
1190803 he continues to oppose the use of nuclear power these misguided policies would result in higher energy costs to american families and businesses and increase dependence on foreign oil were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1190804 the economic benefits of it literacy in emerging markets are currently driving the push for the 100 pc but there are many open questions that remain these include determining the relevant hardware specifications power availability availability and cost of internet connection as well as providing adequate finance and payment options for emerging markets where funds may well be extremely limited
1190805 amd has been declining because it hasnt built a competitive graphics architecture for almost two years now ever since the amd ati merger
1190806 we cannot have a health insurance market in ireland which does not respect community rating
1190807 the real losers as the market will be restored to a virtual monopoly
1190808 the choice innovations and quality of service we have brought to the market over the past ten years and it is with great sadness that we must begin the wind down of our business
1190809 a bad day for irish consumers a bad day for irish jobs and a bad day for competition in the health insurance market
1190810 this is a regulatory failure it is a failure by the fianna fail pd government to strike a balance between the issues of community rating risk equalisation and competition in a way which delivers to the irish people he said
1190811 we will need some people to service existing contracts and claims as we wind down
1190812 members will continue to be provided with a comprehensive quality service until all contracts have expired and claims under those contracts are settled
1190813 members are legally entitled if they wish to transfer to another insurer with no break in insurance cover
1190814 we regret bupas decision to pull out of the irish market there is little competition in the irish health insurance market as it is and bupas decision limits that even further
1190815 it is now critically important that the minister for health addresses as a matter of urgency the dominant position of the vhi in the irish market dominant players are not in consumers interests we have seen that in various sectors of the economy it is not good enough to allow vhi a further six years until 2012 to meet the solvency requirements which other health insurers must meet to do so would strengthen and copperfasten the dominant position of the vhi
1190816 current vhi advantages include the freedom not to comply with capital adequacy requirements which other insurers are required to do
1190817 radical proposals are needed to address this dominance question now otherwise consumers will lose out and the market will continue to be unattractive to new entrants
1190818 in light of this most recent development in the rapidly deteriorating health insurance market it is imperative that the minister for health mary harney takes immediate steps to make the necessary policy changes to ensure that the private health insurance market does not end up operating in a monopoly situation again
1190819 the ministers ill advised decision to trigger the risk equalization subsidy scheme has resulted in one of the three competitors in the market being forced to leave due to the fact that the market structure no longer allows fair competition vivas health is 100 committed to this market however we need the environment that we are operating in to change in order for us to be able to continue to invest and innovate in this market for the benefit of consumers
1190820 this is a bad day for the irish consumer and a bad day for the health insurance market we regret that bupa is pulling out of the market the governments policies in this area have clearly failed we are calling for immediate corrective action on this matter
1190821 we need a clear and detailed policy on competition in the irish health insurance market that will serve as a framework for the future and as a guide to potential new market entrants and investors as well as those already here
1190822 so are these guys just gonna keep dicking around or what

1190851 they are moving away to states where there is no discrimination
1190852 these are good people who are just trying to make a living
1190853 there are huge doubts about the credibility of the analysis
1190854 are people moving around because of shifting economic patterns and are some deciding to move home absolutely
1190855 its an issue that divides the country and neither of them wants that issue to come to the forefront because it divides their base
1190856 theres nothing were doing here that cant be done somewhere else in the world
1190857 in many ways were just too fixated on the near term gyrations which are impossible to explain
1190858 theres no question theres been a price response its just what is the permanence of that price response
1190859 the pullback does not seem to have been sufficient yet to cause people to change a lot of their expectations as to what the future will hold
1190860 a good bellwether is how seriously policy makers are taking this issue and that does not seem to have diminished
1190861 if oil prices drop youre going to see the industrialization in developing countries rev up
1190862 id almost say it will go back to 140 but the question is when in the broader picture its really important to recognize that the softening in demand is the result of the business cycle
1190863 the government wanted to tighten the screw on inflation a bit tighter
1190864 the 70s are inviting because we look like were going to see stagflation again
1190865 but i think in many ways its such a different era that its not a very useful parallel
1190866 people dont forget that it was a real culture shock and people dont want to go there again in terms of their mortgage and unemployment and regional tensions
1190867 the u s economy is not doing great but the main source of trouble is housing and financial
1190868 by itself the increase in the price of oil while clearly bad news will not lead to a replay of the 1970s
1190869 two men rammed a truck into a clutch of jogging policemen and tossed explosives killing 16 officers monday state media said in an attack in a restive province of western china just days before the beijing olympics the state run xinhua news agency reported
1190870 i commend the korean church coalition for giving a voice to the thousands of north korean refugees facing injustices and inhumane conditions in north korea china and other parts of the world i support your efforts to end the sufferings endured by the refugees through non violent means
1190871 the plight of the north korean refugees is a travesty that must be addressed no one should be forced to live in an environment of persecution fear and famine
1190872 i believe that repression of religious freedom and basic human rights anywhere is a detrimental to the advancement of human rights everywhere i look forward to working with the foreign relations committee to ensure that individuals around the world are free to practice religion as they choose and are guaranteed their basic human rights
1190873 the desperation of north korean refugees is an injustice that must be addressed they should not be forcibly returned into persecution they should have the protection to which asylum seekers and refugees are entitled under international law
1190874 north korean refugees continue to be hunted down and repatriated while americans and chinese have been jailed for continuously risking their lives to help them now is the time for china to reach out to these people without a voice without hope and without the chance to live a life of freedom
1190875 and tragically we know that those fortunate north korean refugees who manage to escape the prison represented by their country too often face new abuses beyond north koreas brokers including the threat of forcible return and even greater persecution
1190876 the outcry against the transgressions is building we must not let it die down not when the flame itself goes out this summer at the end of the games and not until human rights violations come to an end

1191006 under the gold standard a free banking system stands as the protector of an economys stability and balanced growth the abandonment of the gold standard made it possible for the welfare statists to use the banking system as a means to an unlimited expansion of credit in the absence of the gold standard there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation

1191010 trucking firms have enjoyed some heady gains in the past couple of weeks and many of them have stretched out to new peaks so why the strength first investors are clearly anticipating higher earnings now that gasoline prices are beginning to come down but that cant be the only reason we think its likely the market is looking ahead toward a faster than expected recovery in the economy or at least in shipping volumes in its recent quarterly report which beat expectations by 25 werners management noted that prices are firming up likely a result of decent demand and fewer trucks on the road analysts are estimating that werners bottom line will jump 29 next year but in a cyclical industry like trucking that could prove to be conservative if energy prices continue to decline

1191039 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
1191040 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
1191041 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
1191042 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
1191043 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
1191044 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
1191045 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
1191046 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
1191047 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
1191048 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november

1191052 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
1191053 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
1191054 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1191055 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1191056 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
1191057 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
1191058 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs

1191069 we talk about senator clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well in a role that is in many ways more powerful than the president
1191070 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1191071 there is significant support among top mccain advisers that he make a transformative pick who would change the republican party someone who would appeal to moderate republicans and democrats this pick would be someone who like mccain has taken the unpopular stands made the hard calls and stood firm on principle a person who fills that bill these advisers say is joe lieberman
1191072 you know something the republicans dont want to win this election they dont mccain may want to win but these people around him that are giving him this advice they must not want to win this election
1191073 there is a reason the american people the past 100 years elevated only two sitting senators into the white house jfk and warren harding its because they believe most senators adept at compulsive compromise have no political compass and will sell them out

1191080 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
1191081 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
1191082 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
1191083 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
1191084 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

1191087 closest thing this movement of anonymous provocateurs has to a spokesman
1191088 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
1191089 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
1191090 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
1191091 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
1191092 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
1191093 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
1191094 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
1191095 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
1191096 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
1191097 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
1191098 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
1191099 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
1191100 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
1191101 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
1191102 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
1191103 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
1191104 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1191105 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1191106 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1191107 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1191108 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1191109 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1191110 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
1191111 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
1191112 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1191113 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1191114 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
1191115 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
1191116 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
1191117 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
1191118 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
1191119 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
1191120 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1191121 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1191122 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1191123 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1191124 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
1191125 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1191126 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1191127 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1191128 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1191129 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1191130 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
1191131 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
1191132 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
1191133 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
1191134 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
1191135 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
1191136 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
1191137 thats old uncle aunt insert name talking out of his her head again
1191138 its not like anybody feels that any of those guys being mentioned in either party has to get it
1191139 maybe its hindsight playing tricks on me but it looks like the short lists in some years past contained people of greater stature
1191140 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1191141 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1191142 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1191143 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1191144 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1191145 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1191146 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1191147 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1191148 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1191149 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1191150 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1191151 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1191152 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1191153 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1191154 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1191155 the bulk of his treatment is completed but he still gets chemo once a week his immune system is still repressed so right now his staff believes he wont go you never know with him though he might get up one day and decide he has to be there
1191156 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
1191157 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
1191158 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
1191159 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science
1191160 la primera vez que intent prepararlo me salio fatal bueno la primera y la segunda y la tercera no es que sea muy dif cil pero hay tener ma a para calcular bien la cantidad de t y az car y para hacer la espuma se vierte el t de un vaso a otro desde cierta altura y es f cil que se salga fuera y ponga perdida la bandeja
1191161 the first time that i tried to prepare a cup of tea was terrible well the first time and the second and the third it is not that difficult but you must calculate precisely the quantity of tea and sugar and make the foam you have to pour out the tea from a certain elevation and then it easily spills out and makes a mess of your platter
1191162 you dont even need to be a suspect of wrong doing or an american citizen your laptop hard drive flash drive cell phone ipod memory cards are all subject to seizure and examination by department of homeland security agents they may also be held indefinitely
1191163 we will not back down we will not slow down we are in this for the long haul
1191164 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is so absurd
1191165 i salute him for that challenge it is absolutely possible to do so
1191166 i think nuclear will play a role i dont think it will be a large increase
1191167 a political promise to do something 40 years from now
1191168 because everyone knows thats meaningless ten years is about the maximum time that we as a nation can hold a steady aim and hit the target
1191169 are the very same measures needed to renew our economy
1191170 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
1191171 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
1191172 in one month than an average american family uses in an entire year
1191173 burned through enough electricity to power 232 average american households for a month
1191174 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
1191175 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
1191176 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
1191177 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
1191178 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1191179 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
1191180 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1191181 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
1191182 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
1191183 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
1191184 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
1191185 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
1191186 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
1191187 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
1191188 you dont see where all the carbon goes so there is a misconception that woody species such as trees and shrubs store more carbon thats just not the case
1191189 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1191190 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1191191 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1191192 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1191193 will attend a weekend meeting with irans chief nuclear negotiator the meeting is part of ongoing efforts to persuade iran to stop its nuclear program
1191194 abba and pierce brosnan thats the best movie i have seen in a long time
1191195 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1191196 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1191197 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1191198 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1191199 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
1191200 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
1191201 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
1191202 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
1191203 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
1191204 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
1191205 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
1191206 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
1191207 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1191208 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1191209 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1191210 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
1191211 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
1191212 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
1191213 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
1191214 we are borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1191215 i for one do not believe our country can withstand 10 more years of the status quo
1191216 we need to change the debate in this country from what we cant do to what we can america has led every major technological shift in the last 100 years and we can lead the next one as well the problem is not technology it is political will
1191217 mr gore has moved a long way from the solutions recommended in
1191218 we couldnt come close to his goal of producing all our electricity from solar wind and geothermal energy in 10 years without coercive even authoritarian government
1191219 young gore sets out for his new home where the sky is clear the water is clean and there are no republicans
1191220 former vice president al gore who for the past three decades has unsuccessfully attempted to warn humanity of the coming destruction of our planet only to be mocked and derided by the very people he has tried to save launched his infant son into space monday in the faint hope that his only child would reach the safety of another world
1191221 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
1191222 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
1191223 this is no fantasy no careless product of wild imagination no my friends these indictments that i have brought to you today specific charges herein against the individuals their acts of treason their ultimate aim of sedition these are matters of undeniable fact i ask you now to pronounce judgment on those accused
1191224 to punish anyone who takes part in a political religious or ethnic demonstration or protest in any form at an olympic site during the 2008 beijing games
1191225 there was a 20 percent increase over 2006 in convictions of citizens under chinas overly broad state security law that is often used to silence government critics
1191226 betr tag der mendener wirtschaft am 10 september sehr geehrter herr schulte zur ckkommend auf unsere besprechung vom 7 juli in ihrem hause und der dabei kontrovers gef hrten diskussion sowie der zwischenzeitlich eingeleiteten juristischen verfahren bitten wir um verst ndnis dass wir bis zur kl rung der angelegenheiten von einer beteiligung an der oben genannten veranstaltung absehen werden wir regen daher an die veranstaltung auf einen sp teren zeitpunkt zu verschieben
1191227 zerf llt die gesellschaftliche mitte in deutschland perspektiven der sozialen marktwirtschaft in zeiten der globalisierung
1191228 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1191229 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1191230 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1191231 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1191232 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1191233 but you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country
1191234 a 90 percent chance that the us has contributed 2 degrees f of temperature increase in the last 50 years
1191235 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
1191236 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
1191237 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real
1191238 first canis focaccia no cheese is italian pizza is american
1191239 america is a deeply racist society and whites are to blame for all of the social problems befalling blacks
1191240 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
1191241 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
1191242 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1191243 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1191244 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1191245 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
1191246 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
1191247 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
1191248 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
1191249 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
1191250 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
1191251 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
1191252 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
1191253 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
1191254 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
1191255 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
1191256 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
1191257 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
1191258 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
1191259 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
1191260 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1191261 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
1191262 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1191263 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
1191264 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
1191265 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
1191266 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
1191267 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
1191268 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
1191269 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
1191270 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1191271 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
1191272 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
1191273 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1191274 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
1191275 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
1191276 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1191277 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
1191278 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1191279 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1191280 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
1191281 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
1191282 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
1191283 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
1191284 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
1191285 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
1191286 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
1191287 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
1191288 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
1191289 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
1191290 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
1191291 that mary kay really jumped the shark when she started going out with vili
1191292 you know its not about you its about your country

1191312 im taking mediocrity to a whole new level i strive to be mediocre mediocrity is crazy delicious to me
1191313 im not a weird weirdo just because i went streaking by the oregon state capitol last april and the governor caught me i was making an important statement that day may day was coming and i was ready to protest
1191314 i cant believe your lack of sympathy poor governor kulongoski when you flashed your
1191315 hypocrisy and embarrassment come in all colors besides with oregons streaking laws being what they are right now i did nothing and it was everything i thought it would be
1191316 you know theres something ive wanted to ask you for a long time how much should a mom be paid for her work as a mom
1191317 if its you nothing not until you get back to normal and you learn how to treat us meh hee canos i remember how you acted last year at cinco de mayo going up to hispanic strangers on the street and wishing them a happy independence day it was the most embarrassing day of my life then the way you kept eating anything you could get your hands on there was probably about 40 grams total fat consumed
1191318 youre just jealous because its smarter to be lucky than its lucky to be smart and wasnt it you who told me to expect the unexpected with mexican food
1191319 and entered it in the county fair and it won a blue ribbon they were not my best amigas that day

1191324 you know ncs youre normally not this uptight what happened to you
1191325 whos they you mean those freaky carnies that read our fortunes when we went to the fair i thought you became a mother because you wanted to say happy fathers day to your husband every year and to have a reason to give him copies of of mice and men hes such a steinbeck fan and his short term memory loss makes it easy to keep giving him the same gift year after year
1191326 but millie youre forgetting the most important rule of all dont mess with bloggers another trite bit of advice ive passed on that youve apparently forgotten is every dog has his day
1191327 so thats why you always take joey to the office for take your dog to not work day but whats with the name joey for an animal isnt that kind of end of the road
1191328 i cant help it matt le blanc is so hot
1191329 youre ruining my proud mommy moment im cracking down on goofy names even for dogs someone has to do it
1191330 being able to name your kid something totally laughable is a great part of living in the land of the free home of the brave ncs if you want to name your kid pete zahutt or ivana spankyew thats really nothing to see here whats your deal are you ashamed proud or cultural
1191331 thats another thing i cant remember all i have left is childhood remembered some of it at least but one thing im sure of is no one has ever called me your honor before and i know i heart trailers and am i wrong or is it rico saturday today
1191332 see its starting to come back to you already this is the day you set aside to write poems about
1191333 well it started when you took that trip to the center of the earth almost it was one of the lessons from your trip 0 is the new 2 you also discovered the truth about the box in the shopping bag and wow did it freak you out not that i blame you bloggers are very sensitive no wonder it sent you into a downward spiral that had you singing these are a few of my favorite things for hours
1191334 i went on a trip how long was i gone
1191335 all i remember is you were here today gone tomorrow and next week too
1191336 oh yes i also remember a beach beer sunglasses not in that order and a hairy hippie minister preaching about the truth of the real deal then there was the pizza box i tripped over on my way to the dumpster
1191337 right and then you took a silly saturday pic of a guy yelling adios to you while you were saying hola to him it was a non beauty week for you remember
1191338 alas where did my cowbell go i swore i would never forget but i guess im out of the zone its depressing i was going to call in sick but then i started having all these random thoughts
1191339 like how much i love the 80s and that story my sister told me about politics tin foil and not mulder i even made a cool graphic to illustrate but i was interrupted by an attack of silliness and my super cool new avatar which by the way you apparently dont like
1191340 you know what i say about people who have a problem with super happy girl let them eat carrots my friend chris brown loves her he said he wanted to marry her and i said chris brown you tease you tell me what does that mean
1191341 it sounds like he wants to take you on his weekly trip to the mall adventure like chris always says nothing bad could happen to you there sounds dodgy to me i wouldnt trust him to put up my autumn party decor on halloween even if he is good at mextionary
1191342 oh millie you sound like linus yelling great pumpkin this way comes that is you would if linus talked like yoda youre just bugged because you lost super happy girls how much in my penny banco contest the winner got to be shgs bf 4 ever if thats not a good prize i dont know what is unless its my blog which is worth 12 419 88
1191343 please ncs tell me something if blogger falls and crashes in the forest can anyone comment i think not you are so weird it doesnt matter how many of those self help im a winner cassettes you listen to youll always be obsessed with pop culture
1191344 but youre forgetting one thing this is halloween the halloween that wasnt i spent the day spotlighting molfs instead of trick or treating for me its just one more reason to not get a bike but the most important issue is its tuesday the 7th do you know where your vote is
1191345 it never ends with you does it i dont know where my vote is probably stuck on my desk still call nancy drew its the mysterious mystery of the disappearing act i want to believe every vote counts but these candidates are looking for votes in all the wrong places
1191346 uh oh millie its that time of the month again isnt it i probably shouldnt suggest that we declare this u cook day or else well be feeding what you make to the dogs oh well maybe angela will be my neighbor
1191347 all play and no work make ncs a fat slob
1191348 well i was feeling generous the day i said that i was wearing my feng shui approved red and green elf outfit and telling everyone they better not pout passing out christmas ornaments to everyone on our people we dont like list
1191349 ah the list its like the soundtrack of my life i have to read it while the spotlight is on because my eyes are so bad i always have to ask do you see what i see its like that scene from pay it forward when helen hunt visits her mom at the dump and they lose their eyesight in a barrel explosion
1191350 that never happened millie your bad eyes are going to see the mean side of ncs and there will be no christmas gifts for you next year if you dont stop babbling hey look at my ducks outside they do grow up fast dont they pretty soon dh and firstborn can butcher them i can already taste that duck gumbo may blogtopia be my witness duck gumbo is mmmm mmmm good
1191351 is that whats new around here i thought you were forming a duckling choir
1191352 music is a lot easier when theyre little but no buying the ducklings was the highlight of my shopping day after the farm it was nothing but pinnacles of mediocrity
1191353 well for those about to eat duck gumbo i salute you duck gumbo in holiday tupperware would make silly presents for all theres no better way to say merry christmas from the future than with duck gumbo
1191354 i could od times 1 000 on it late friday i sang for auld lang syne my dear to the ducks since they wouldnt be around for another new years day
1191355 this year will be the year of more cowbell i hope and more u sweaters when to wear a u sweater is one of the things i learned just yesterday for example you should wear a u sweater when youre happy or wearing ugly socks or when youre sure that dreams do come true but not if its your chance to say hola because then it turns into an awesome waste of time
1191356 millie i dont know where youre getting your u sweater information but only an extraordinary man like dr huxtable can wear a u sweater if youre not one youll just leave a paper trail and youll be blasted with unkind remarks in a moment of truth youll be forced to start the blogger diet and youll be late for the party it wont be a day filled with joy and cheer believe you me
1191357 but what about in the youtube universe or if you wear the u sweater for 399 hours and 46 minutes what if there are two big unfortunately positioned sheep on your u sweater then is it ok
1191358 these are a few of my fave things millie a big gracias to you for catching on on a personal note could you keep your u sweater wearing down to a one time wonder your u sweater makes me laugh really hard but i must get back to work before i take teenagerism to the max and get all demotivational
1191359 millie you remembered i thought i would have to spell it out from a to z for you but my mama said just be patient shell figure it out
1191360 now if i could just figure out the a b cs of homemaking id make us a friday feast

1191390 a world which has to create its own justice is a world without hope
1191391 a world marked by so much injustice innocent suffering and cynicism of power cannot be the work of a good god
1191392 the claim that humanity can and must do what no god actually does or is able to do is both presumptuous and intrinsically false
1191393 it is no accident that this idea has led to the greatest forms of cruelty and violations of justice rather it is grounded in the intrinsic falsity of the claim a world which has to create its own justice is a world without hope

1191398 simply because they do not find the prospect of eternal life attractive what they desire is not eternal life at all but this present life for which faith in eternal life seems something of an impediment to continue living forever endlessly appears more like a curse than a gift

1191403 as a consequence this created a climate of intolerance and discrimination
1191404 difficult for the church of scientology to recover and properly defend itself before the court
1191405 why do we need the federal government theres no cold war and no communist threat many other nations are breaking into smaller and smaller pieces the centralization of power in washington occurred in a different time why not think about getting rid of the federal government returning to the system of our founders and breaking up the united states into smaller government units

1191442 we the undersigned petition the prime minister to stop milton keynes council in their senseless plan to develop a casino in milton keynes
1191443 presents himself as a harmoniser for all the opposing interests in british life a conciliator of class differences and tribal antipathies a synthesiser of opposing beliefs
1191444 recent research carried out by the government has shown that significant social problems arise when casinos open in new areas issues like problem gambling are the tip of the iceberg the only winners at casinos are the casino owners and everyone else loses in the long term the creation of a few jobs does not justify the lasting damage that will be caused by a casino being opened in milton keynes
1191445 milton keynes council did initial research into a casino in 2006 and nearly fifty percent of the 2000 people they asked were opposed to the idea we want a proper debate on the subject and proper consultation it is not acceptable for the democratically elected members of the council and our mps to think that a casino is right for milton keynes without actively asking the people of milton keynes
1191446 milton keynes has a serious lack of facilities that families can use for little or no cost the attractions at the city centre come with a high price tag and we are calling for the council to use taxpayers money to invest in family centres and youth clubs providing safe and positive places for families and children to spend time together we dont want casinos that take money out of the pockets of those who need it we want public facilities that encourage families to spend time with one another participating in positive activities
1191447 what will we do with the rest of our lives

1191498 he had a conservative and retrograde view of looking back to russias roots idealizing the purity of sprit and making it the center of the russian universe that was his dream
1191499 he was totally uncompromised in this attempt and it was difficult for both liberals and conservatives to be his following to the liberals his conservative views about russias his anti western views his sharp criticism of the west was something they could not accept to the conservatives his call his claims he lay on the nation were somehow too rigorous something that the conservatives may like to listen to but could not live up to he will remain a figure of gigantic proportion maybe too big for the modern world

1191524 the states gun seizure law is considered the first and only law in the country that allows the confiscation of a gun before the owner commits an act of violence police and state prosecutors can obtain seizure warrants based on concerns about someones intentions

1191526 the test of a first rate mind is the ability to hold two diametrically opposed ideas at the same time and still function
1191527 thats not basketball if my boys ever shot one handed id quit coaching
1191528 you always want to go out but there always comes a point of being smart
1191529 being over 100 pitches going through eight innings leaving the game is probably the best thing you dont get real caught up in the complete games and all that stuff
1191530 its really my pleasure to be able to manage a guy like doc theres not much management to it you pretty much put him out there and let him go
1191531 theres no doubt he has a little bit of everything
1191532 i dont know how he gets it to look like that really
1191533 you look up there and its the same speed but it seems like its slower or seems like its a little sharper he knows how to pitch
1191534 i felt like my curveball was better than it has been my last couple of starts
1191535 for me that was probably the biggest difference i had more confidence throwing it in different counts
1191536 i was trying to nibble way too much trying to make perfect pitches and ended up missing by a lot most of the time
1191537 he had command issues tonight right from the first batter of the game
1191538 his arm angles seemed a bit lower than normal well review it and see if theres any adjustments that need to be made
1191539 people see something on tv and spend time and money to duplicate it and it doesnt fit in

1191543 i do tend to develop a relationship with all the dancers that was something i wanted to do from the word go
1191544 i wanted to be involved in the whole audition process and do one of those things where if the kids are lining up on the streets of new york and it is 5 oclock and the snow is coming down then so am i

1191556 how one comes to know about the world others and reality is also fundamentally centered in detachment rationality and objectivity are the only ways one can
1191557 strength of mind rests in sobriety for this keeps your reason unclouded by passion
1191558 the patient eye of love teaches us how real things can be looked at and loved without being seized and used without being appropriated into the greedy organism of the self
1191559 in the moment when i truly understand my enemy understand him well enough to defeat him then in that very moment i also love him i think its impossible to really understand somebody what they want what they believe and not love them the way they love themselves
1191560 exploring maternal ambivalence comparing findings with two opposing paradigms of intent
1191561 our metaphysics our view of reality influences our epistemology the way we gain knowledge and together the two determine our axiology our values
1191562 everyone is not seen as related to others in inextricable or intrinsic ways every person is individualistic and atomistic
1191563 these conceptions of the self isolate the individual from personal relationships and larger social forces
1191564 the individual as a free and rational chooser and actor an autonomous agent
1191565 ones detachment and separateness from others as a necessary precondition in doing so
1191566 focuses on challenging the self subsisting self with its sharp self other boundaries chodorows claim that the self is inextricable from interpersonal relationships calls into question decontextualized individualism
1191567 what i do for my own good is necessarily also good for my unit in respecting the other the self is simultaneously respected
1191568 exploring maternal ambivalence comparing findings with two opposing paradigms of intent
1191569 pursuing psychology as science of the ethical contributions of the work of emmanuel levinas
1191570 it is only in the encounter of another person that the self comes into being and thus it comes into being in a relationship of some kind
1191571 thus an egocentric worldview automatically reduces genuine altruism to a sophisticated kind of self interest however in an other centered worldview this reduction of altruistic behavior is not necessary we can act out of genuine interest for others and that interest can be even more primordial than self interest
1191572 in this paradigm thinking clearly precedes relating to others morally
1191573 well that may be true for you but thats your truth i have my own truth
1191574 that way of life may make you happy but im just different this way of life makes me happy
1191575 it is impossible for the self to independently choose some individual morality apart from the other in fact acting for the good of the other is what defines morality
1191576 well theyve never learned about chastity its wrong for us because weve made covenants but they havent made those same covenants
1191577 exploring maternal ambivalence comparing findings with two opposing paradigms of intent
1191578 ye cannot know of things which ye do not see
1191579 when a man was dead that was the end thereof
1191580 he who picks up one end of the stick picks up the other
1191581 where the self is seen as separate autonomy begins with man as an isolated rational chooser his independent will being the first precondition
1191582 capacity of the individual to choose independent of any other sources or influences
1191583 man is an agent autonomous precisely because of the other not despite him
1191584 welcome to the human race nobody controls his own life the best you can do is choose to be controlled by good people by people who love you
1191585 exploring maternal ambivalence comparing findings with two opposing paradigms of intent
1191586 the answer is to get a different string not to get rid of the string altogether a stronger longer string will increase the kites freedom the way to freedom is not to sever ties but to honor them in the right way
1191587 brett favre and mike mccarthy started talking at 6 oclock theyre still talking and i dont know how much longer it will go

1191589 wahai manusia jangan engkau menjadi orang yang terlambat dalam bertaubat membumbung angan angan dan mengharap kenikmatan hidup di akhirat tanpa amal berkata seperti ahli ibadah beramal seperti orang munafik jika diberi karunia tidak pernah mau menerima apa adanya jika tidak diberi tidak mau bersabar mengajak berbuat baik pada orang lain tapi ia sendiri mengabaikannya mencegah orang lain agar tidak berbuat nista sementara ia sendiri melakukannya mencintai orang yang suka berbuat baik namun ia sendiri tidak termasuk di dalamnya membenci orang yang bersikap hipokrit padahal ia termasuk di dalamnya mengatakan sesuatu yang tidak ia perbuat dan melakukan apa yang ia cegah menuntut orang lain memenuhi janji namun ia sendiri mengkhianatinya wahai manusia dalam setiap pergantian hari sesungguhnya bumi selalu berkata kepadamu wahai manusia engkau berjalan di atas punggungku kemudian jenazahmu ditaruh di dalam perutku engkau makan sesuka hatimu di atas punggungku dan setelah itu ulat ulat memakan bangkaimu di dalam perutku wahai manusia sungguh aku ini adalah sarang binatang buas rumah saling menuntut rumah tempat tinggal bersama rumah kegelapan sarang ular dan kalajengking maka hendaknya engkau membangun diriku bukan justru memporak porandakan diriku

1191613 it was quite a big deal to me i lost all my emails and quite a lot of private stuff on the bebo page
1191614 if it happens to anyone they should let the police know so things can be done about it and people will be aware there are consequences

1191641 the mccain tv ad that intersperses blonde women celebrities britney spears and paris hilton with black man barack obama is an obvious attempt to play upon american bigoted fears
1191642 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them

1191650 se trata de una organizaci n bien plantada son varios sujetos operan mediante retenes donde capturan a los secuestrados

1191653 so it would imply that people who have a mutation in this gene and are susceptible to cancer have inherently regions of their dna which are duplicated or deleted and therefore are unstable
1191654 and that may have something to do with the mechanism by which they develop cancer
1191655 what is also striking is that with each successive generation the cancers tend to occur earlier in age and may also be more aggressive biologically
1191656 so rather than what we have to do now look for everything at every age which becomes an extreme burden on the patients and their families you may be able to say for such and such a person in the family we only need to focus on this tumour type starting from this age
1191657 hope for the future hope that in an lfs family that the legacy of loss will end
1191658 we know cancer to be basically a disease of genetic instability in the cancer cells and all weve done here is use an unusual model to show that that instability is actually present in every cell in every person
1191659 could we just teach them our good habits and not our bad
1191660 that just highlights how important it is to intervene early and set healthy lifestyle patterns early on

1191663 mom i have just one more question for you who is bossy
1191664 is that it prevents a billboard company from unilaterally putting up a dynamic sign and saying it has a right to disregard local laws to the contrary it is an expansion of what they had before and theyve got to obey the laws as written

1191667 would to god that all the lords people were prophets
1191668 way i see it you can keep working here and break even but i dont see the point
1191669 the main cause has been the influx of asian made or chinese boards into the uk
1191670 the danger is if this continues at the current rate the industry is going to die

1191686 although i do not consider her the favorite to win this race we can never count out torres and her incredible will to win especially because this race could represent the first and only individual gold medal of her olympic career

1191739 the economy purrs at a growth rate of better than 8
1191740 over the past four years argentina has recovered its hope
1191741 the biggest significance of this recovery is they just rejected the orthodox economic advice and theyve been the fastest growing economy in the western hemisphere over the last five years

1191793 que el tribunal supremo de justicia se pronuncie antes de que se inicie el proceso de postulaci n en todo caso toda elecci n implica la preparaci n de un cronograma que en el caso del cne se rige por una maquinaria al estilo de las relojer as suizas con mucha presici n
1191794 de esta manera cambiar el cronograma implica una serie de prelaciones para los eventos subsiguientes si las postulaciones se prorrogan eso tendr un efecto domin sobre todos los otros eventos y eso implicar a retrasar el cronograma de esta manera lo aconsejable seria no modificar lo planificado

1191875 the message was to just to keep doing the things wed been doing for the three quarters before that and not to waste it obviously they came back hard and they nearly ran over the top of us but it was good that we were able to hold them off and come away with the win
1191876 i probably didnt get nervous but youre obviously thinking bloody hell its on the line here so we just needed to make sure that we stayed in front

1191979 sesungguhnya ketika orang kafir akan mati turun kepadanya malaikat malaikat dari langit dengan wajah wajah yang hitam
1191980 wahai jiwa yang jelek keluarlah menuju kemurkaan allah dan kemarahan nya
1191981 sekali kali tidak akan dibukakan bagi mereka pintu pintu langit dan tidak pula mereka masuk surga hingga unta masuk ke lubang jarum
1191982 barangsiapa mempersekutukan allah dengan sesuatu maka ia seolah olah jatuh dari langit lalu disambar oleh burung atau diterbangkan angin ke tempat yang jauh
1191983 dia berdusta hamparkanlah hamparan dari neraka dan bukakanlah pintu ke neraka

1191987 the saintly bishop ambrose of whom i will speak to you today died during the night in milan between april 3 4 397
1191988 and offered the saint the body of the lord after having taken the lord as viaticum ambrose surrendered his spirit thus his soul strengthened by virtue of that food now enjoys the company of angels
1191989 omnia christus est nobis if you want to heal a wound he is the physician if you burn with fever he is the fountain if you are oppressed by iniquity he is justice if you need help he is strength if you fear death he is life if you desire heaven he is the way if you are in darkness he is the light taste and see how good the lord is blessed is the man who hopes in him

1191993 tennessee has higher sales and excise taxes than any surrounding state in several major categories and has a higher rate than all but two of those states in gasoline taxes
1191994 the sudden drop in expected revenues is a sign from those who live close enough to the border that they have had enough
1191995 we must reign in excess spending and focus on the basic functions of state government
1191996 this legislation is vital to keeping taxes low education is a politicians favorite excuse for raising taxes if education has already been funded we can find out what they really want us to pay for
1191997 education is the primary means of economic improvement for our state and its citizens we must fund education to the level that is needed and stop holding the education system hostage in order to increase taxes our children and their futures are too important
1191998 we arent sure what but there seems to be some possibility of fraud
1191999 every four years the people of this county get to decide whether or not they are happy with how you have handled the mayors office

1192001 death was not part of nature it became part of nature god did not decree death from the beginning he prescribed it as a remedy human life was condemned because of sin to unremitting labor and unbearable sorrow and so began to experience the burden of wretchedness there had to be a limit to its evils death had to restore what life had forfeited without the help of grace immortality is more of a burden than a blessing we have a doctor to heal us let us use the remedy he prescribes the remedy is the grace which christ gives let us be exiles from our body so as not to be exiles from christ5 though we are still in the body let us not give ourselves to the things of the body we must not reject the natural rights of the body but we must desire above all things the gifts of grace it was by the death of one man that the world was redeemed christ did not need to die if he did not want to but he did not look on death as something to be despised something to be avoided and he could have found no better means to save us than by dying thus his death is life for all we are sealed with the sign of his death when we pray we preach his death when we offer sacrifice we proclaim his death his death is victory his death is a sacred sign each year his death is celebrated with solemnity by the whole world death then is no cause for mourning for it is the cause of mankinds salvation death is not something to be avoided for the son of god did not think it beneath his dignity nor did he seek to escape it

1192029 the reason this fine is so high is that sadly the company was warned about this matter there had been a similar incident some time before the problem had been identified and the problem wasnt fixed
1192030 this problem was known and it wasnt fixed until a man died that is what makes this case so serious
1192031 i would just like to say at fosters we are shocked and saddened by this terrible tragedy

1192037 in the medium and the longer term they are well chosen deliberate buybacks which will provide once we get some water into the system the type of relief the river does need
1192038 theres no water there for farmers theres no water there for irrigators theres very little water there for the buybacks
1192039 were committed to making sure that we do start to get some water into the river system to help the environment but the fact is that particularly with some of these licences at this point in time theres a shortage of water
1192040 all they did was buy the cheapest water they could to make it look like theyve got the 35 gigalitres theyre aiming for which cant be delivered
1192041 over 40 per cent of what they bought this year was in the lachlan river or north and it never flows into the murray river system except once every 50 years

1192082 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1192083 if videotapes were made they were likely used for translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1192084 we knew for a while that all the interrogations and questioning was being recorded and that that was the routine
1192085 we sent a total of three teams and it was common knowledge that all the interviews with the detainees were videotaped and recorded
1192086 perlindungan tenaga kerja indonesia di malaysia pasca penandatanganan mou sektor formal dan informal
1192087 saya kira perlu digaungkan agar pemerintah indonesia menyetop pengiriman prt ke malaysia hingga perlindungan terhadap mereka jelas artinya diatur dalam kontrak yang jelas mengenai gaji jam kerja jatah libur kebebasan untuk beribadah dan penyelesaian hukum yang cepat dan adil bila ada perselisihan antara majikan dan prt
1192088 kami di indonesia tidak banyak mendengar perlakukan tki yang menjadi prt di malaysia dan baru kali ini banyak mendengar dengan komprehensif
1192089 pemerintah hongkong dan taiwan sangat jelas mengatur apa hak dan kewajiban majikan terhadap prt misalkan gaji jam kerja hak cuti dan hak beribadah diatur dengan rinci bila ada perselisihan dan majikan melanggar aturan maka dapat dikenakan sanksi tapi mou nota kesepahaman antara indonesia dan malaysia kurang mengatur hak dan kewajiban dari majikan serta sanksi jika ada pelanggaran
1192090 oleh karena tidak ada aspek perlindungan dari uu ketenagakerjaan di malaysia dan juga tidak ada kontrak kerja yang jelas antara majikan dengan prt atau agennya maka prt sering dilanggar haknya misalnya menerima penyiksaan pelecehan seksual tidak dibayar gajinya dan paspor dipegang oleh majikan
1192091 jika ada penyiksaan dan prt melaporkan kepada polisi maka prt itu tidak boleh bekerja sambil menunggu proses pengadilan selesai ketika menunggu proses pengadilan ia harus mengajukan kartu penduduk khusus ke imigrasi dan membayar 100 ringgit sekitar rp250 000 dan itu harus diperpanjang setiap bulan sebesar 100 ringgit bagaimana prt punya uang tidak boleh bekerja selama proses pengadilan dan selama belum selesai ia harus memperpanjang kartu khusus dengan harga 100 ringgit ke imigrasi
1192092 kasus nirmala bonet sudah berjalan tiga tahun lebih pengadilan negeri malaysia saja belum ada keputusan selama tiga tahun nirmala mendekam di penampungan kbri ia sudah bosan dan ingin pulang kerjanya makan tidur dan bengong ia tidak boleh keluar dari penampungan kbri sementara yang menyiksa boleh keluar penjara dengan jaminan bahkan bisa pergi ke mana mana
1192093 sudah lebih setahun kita dihadapkan pada bencana lapindo yang tak kunjung selesai sementara penderitaan korbannya sudah sampai di batas toleransi pemerintah jatim dan organisasi kemasyarakatan seperti tidak punya nyali untuk turut mencarikan jalan keluar dari bencana ini ada seniman yang jual tampang ke sana tetapi hanya untuk menambah heboh penderitaan tidak semakin berkurang presiden pun pernah datang ke lokasi tetapi hasilnya sami mawon siapa yang sebenarnya bertanggung jawab untuk bencana lapindo itu perusahaan pemerintah atau tidak seorang pun

1192115 why is her performance rating up even if her personal rating is low this is all because of perception that people blame her for the countrys problems
1192116 after finally deciding to get professional help i felt like maybe talking about my situation could be a blessing to someone else going through the same things
1192117 regardless of whether youre a celebrity or you play for the philadelphia eagles and youre in the limelight you still go through problems
1192118 a lot of things in my life have happened even since ive come to philadelphia
1192119 random people have pulled out a gun on me one time during the playoffs some guy walked from around a building and said youre going to the pro bowl blank him hes not going to the pro bowl luckily i was talking to someone and i didnt hear him if i heard it i think id have been on the ground
1192120 ive just had a lot of thoughts and questions going through my mind about a lot of things
1192121 some things im embarrassed to talk about but even dating back to when i was growing up people made fun of me i always wanted people to think i was more than what i was
1192122 when i got into the nfl i wanted to be man enough to admit that but i tried to use material things to say who i was i know now that some of the happiest times in my life were when i didnt have a pot to piss in im hoping this is just part of my growing process
1192123 ive never been a big fan of medication but at this point in my life i feel like every little bit helps i was at the end of the road
1192124 i didnt want anybody to see me walking into a psych clinic professionals arent always the answer sometimes just talking things out helps and now with all the rumors coming out it has only made things worse some of the comments really got to me you always hear guys say that they dont care what people think and sometimes i dont about certain things but in the grand scheme i want people to think positive about me
1192125 i would have been there physically but mentally i wouldnt have been an asset to my team or myself i could have got myself or one of my teammates hurt
1192126 for a while i didnt work out and i didnt put my weight back on
1192127 i went about a month and i only gained two pounds but i started working out again and that helped me through some things im still 335 and in shape
1192128 i really do miss a lot of aspects of the game but my story everything is real if i sit here and lie to you im lying to myself hopefully the doctor will give me the ok to play but i wont everything is ok if it isnt
1192129 thats college money for my son but whatever the number is that hasnt been my focus
1192130 i know the value of a dollar i come from a household of four where the weekly income was 200 or 300 dollars a week i just felt my mental health was more important than a dollar
1192131 i think every time weve talked he became more sensitive that i do have issues going on
1192132 ill admit that i said some things around my teammates that have created some of the rumors that have been going on but a lot of that was said out of anger i said i might give football up because i didnt know how to handle my anger this really has taken a toll on me mentally
1192133 i think that was just part of me trying to identify myself
1192134 ive always felt like i was different i feel like im an abstract person and i still wonder who shawn andrews is thats why you always see me joking around being around people and singing activates my fun side at the end of the day this doesnt take away from my fun side but it has for the time being
1192135 what the hell did you eat tonight it looks like ass did a four year old get loose in the kitchen
1192136 this is a war not only against the us but against our way of freedom
1192137 we have been fighting for over 16 years against islamic extremism it is also my war
1192138 the army has also been quietly growing its own capability to recruit and train arab americans and others as american soldiers to do high level work overseas
1192139 yet when it comes to linguistic and cultural expertise few can compare to a native speaker defense officials say
1192140 they hear things that are said around them they are able to see things that others cant see
1192141 he was pretty much giving an order to have the commander killed
1192142 right there a life was saved you can see just by knowing a bit of slang being a native speaker it can make a difference
1192143 ms sami lee has showed her skill in producing emotionally intense light hearted action which was attention grabbing and sensual at the same time her main characters were so real it was as if i knew them personally the minor characters just enhanced the storyline itself this book had a passionate plot with a great deliverance i could not put the book down it was a remarkable story with an excellent storyline i recommend it for a great read
1192144 the length and depth of that is uncertain i think if a recession occurred it could be shallow but any meaningful recovery in the housing market is unlikely before next year employment is fragile these are difficult conditions and they will remain difficult into next year too
1192145 i dont think emerging markets have completely decoupled from europe north america or japan there has been an element of decoupling there is an increasing amount of exports to other destinations there will be an impact from a us recession there is no question
1192146 the near term outlook remains negative with a significant degree of uncertainty there is pressure on a number of emerging markets in terms of inflation
1192147 north america continues to disappoint we warned in late 2006 that we saw the consumer market weakening and regrettably we havent been proved wrong
1192148 irresponsible and infeasible and not in the interests of our shareholders
1192149 as long as we can acquire sufficient liquid assets we will be all right
1192150 as downtown transitions from large corporations to smaller businesses we want to find out what their challenges are
1192151 we want to tell them were very happy you look upon dayton as a place for your business
1192152 when we track job gains and losses downtown the vast majority of new jobs are from growing existing businesses
1192153 from a 50 000 feet perspective its got to be disappointing considering the rate we are moving
1192154 i am encouraged that business leaders want to change the environment downtown to better position the city to capture its share of the growth
1192155 weve got a lot of strong positives we just have to get through this difficult period
1192156 when you look at the overall regional economy we are holding our own
1192157 obviously we expected this announcement it was a business decision well be working with reynolds and reynolds to find a new tenant
1192158 key is the long term stability of keeping these companies downtown

1192160 watch for the first time on television the great migrations across our landscape
1192161 the mccain tv ad that intersperses blonde women celebrities britney spears and paris hilton with black man barack obama is an obvious attempt to play upon american bigoted fears
1192162 its really not surprising considering the lead we got from overseas markets
1192163 all the base metals were hammered overnight with copper nickel and aluminium all down between three and four per cent
1192164 were seeing a bit of portfolio shifting out of the resources and into the financial as investors chase the potentially higher yields on offer through the banks

1192192 the weakness in the leading index components relating to employment and new orders is concerning
1192193 in response to steadily declining new orders businesses are using existing inventories of finished goods to meet current demand for services
1192194 the latest employment sub index readings show that services firms are also re evaluating their staffing requirements in light of the economic slowdown
1192195 the company is unfortunately no longer in business and therefore cannot continue its service to you
1192196 a 20 per cent rise next year might be achievable and there is certainly talk of a smaller one the year after
1192197 we dont subscribe to the theory that it is suddenly going to fall to the depths which some of the analysts do
1192198 why we dont subscribe to that theory is that all of the infrastructure is full at the moment so any new projects have roughly the same amount of capital intensity it doesnt matter if its us or bhp or rio
1192199 i think were also seeing projects are harder to develop than people think
1192200 were not convinced that all the projects out there will ramp up as quickly as has been talked about
1192201 there has been quite a push to move away from it
1192202 from what ive seen the steel makers and iron ore producers are relatively comfortable with it
1192203 we might move into a pricing separation based on some very high grade iron ore and some lower grade
1192204 weve seen that already with lump going up 95 per cent and fines only went up by 85 per cent
1192205 lump is getting harder to find and is a premium product

1192212 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1192213 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities
1192214 peace it does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise trouble or hard work it means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart
1192215 we dont want the government shutdown to be an issue but the fact is the democrats are so overconfident that theyre willing to talk about a ban and theyre willing to talk about raising taxes on gasoline so this is just pretty incredible
1192216 but i think that once americans realize that this drilling ban will expire unless we pass something i think there is going to be just an outcry to not vote for anything that had a ban in it
1192217 if the democrats choose to hold the continuation of government operations as a hostage then as far as im concerned i cant vote for anything that has a ban in it
1192218 that would just be a betrayal of everything were talking about as republicans and i think that most republicans are going to feel that way
1192219 on october 1 the bans on offshore drilling and oil shale recovery will end enabling us to finally be able to develop more american energy unless democrats actively prohibit exploration
1192220 i hope that speaker pelosi and democrats in the house and senate recognize the pain americans are feeling and will not actively enact legislation to block the development of american energy

1192222 there has been something absurd about the way that john mccain and barack obama debate the timing and extent of a us military withdrawal as if this is an issue that is going to be settled solely by american domestic politics every opinion poll taken in iraq since 2003 shows that the great majority of iraqis outside kurdistan oppose the occupation and want it ended
1192223 when the us and britain invaded iraq they started three wars the first is the insurgency in the sunni community against the american occupation the second the struggle by the iraqi shia sixty per cent of the population allied to the kurds to take control of the iraqi state previously controlled by the sunni and the third a proxy war between the us and iran about which of them is to have predominant influence in iraq
1192224 no i dont joey galloway is still not ready to go b j askew is still not ready to go ill say jeff garcia and jovan haye are making progress but theyre still not ready to go charles bennett left practice with some heat and hydration problems i believe hell be ok other than that i really dont have any other updates antonio bryant made his return today and was somewhat limited but he gutted it out its a credit to him
1192225 well luke mccown had both of them we dont get out here early every day all year and get center quarterback exchanges for any other reason thats the no 1 fundamental in this game at this point in time its ridiculous
1192226 i saw some improvement the guys are practicing hard its very competitive every time the defense stuffs the offense you want to be mad if youre an offensive coach when we get a big explosive play offensively you want to be mad if youre a defensive coach but when you go back to your room to look at the tape theres some very good things that we can build off of
1192227 im doing well its a grind putting together the scripts putting together the rotations what we worked on today we worked on the four minute drill where the offense has a lead and youve got to make a first down running the ball normally to close out the football game we were successful once and unsuccessful another time we worked on the last three plays of the game in desperation with our backup players that could possibly be in that role against the dolphins you try to be creative to stimulate your players and also challenge them its been fun in some regard its also been a lot of late nights and early mornings you get a little tired but im going to live when im alive and sleep when im dead as bon jovi says
1192228 he looks good he runs effortlessly hes making the effort to become a more reliable blocker hes a rare target throwing the football to him hes got great receiving ability and we like the things hes doing
1192229 warrick looks good to me warrick is picking it up he understands the offense hes more comfortable hes moving very quick and instinctively and im really impressed with warrick dunn
1192230 he can watch and be a spectator at this point hopefully in the next 48 hours hell be able to get back on the practice field in some capacity whether it be in a walkthrough or in individual work hes not far away but these injuries youve got to be careful with you dont want to have a setback hes making real good progress
1192231 well hand out a game plan so to speak were not really specifically looking at the dolphin defense theyre going to run a 3 4 defense theyve got a new defensive staff there were going to try to continue to challenge our players learning our offense and well put together and introduce the miami dolphins to our players so our players are familiar with their personnel and their scheme but were not going to spend countless hours game planning for the regular season we never do
1192232 i see a lot of what i saw last year in the second half of the season i see a guy that not only can rush the passer and has speed to get the corner but hes also becoming a much more complete player were running the ball left in our 9 on 7 drills more than we ever had just to try to get him ready for the regular season and obviously we want to try to become a better running team left and right inside and out hes a more complete player and hes got great upside
1192233 no hell we have so many quarterbacks i collect them so were going to have to figure out what to do well have a starter and well try to get as many guys in the game as we can but well make that assessment here in the next couple days and well go from there
1192234 hes a pro bowl quarterback that had a very good offseason hes in tremendous shape except for his calf so i feel good about garcia i really feel good with the way brian griese is moving this football team right now hes making a lot of throws really good decisions and hes handling the no huddle offense extremely well i like the flash that luke mccown has hes got some real flash playmaking ability weve just got to harness it a little bit better weve got to do a bit better job coaching
1192235 i didnt see much of the game last night obviously we had meetings ourselves but hall of fame weekend is more than just a preseason football game the introduction of emmitt thomas art monk darrell green gary zimmerman andre tippett what a great great weekend
1192236 obviously this is a different training camp than weve experienced weve been going indoors for the most part in the afternoon well have three or four guys normally get ivs in the morning but we havent had any in the afternoon our training staff todd toriscelli was at the university of miami down there hes on the cutting edge of dealing with the heat hydrating our players and taking care of them the cool down tent halfway through practice is a real good way to cool the body temperature also
1192237 its helped big time as a matter of fact it simulates halftime too at a home game our players they go through half the practice then they go inside and get a chance to use the restroom get a drink cool their body temperature then go out and play the second half so it simulates an nfl sunday in our stadium and were thankful to have that cool down tent
1192238 i wouldnt say that it just gets more enjoyable to be honest with you i understand this part of the process building your team and thats something i look forward to getting a chance to go out there and compete and earn your spot on this team for me its a single minded approach taking it day by day and before you know it you have your first pre season game and you go through that process and the seasons here so for me i try not to let the days run against each other and really try to keep a single minded focus on each day
1192239 for one obviously the facilities are different from when i was a rookie i think thats probably the toughest thing compared to what these guys are going through and when i was a rookie i didnt have the experience of a 13 14 year old veteran on our football team thats been through the success of winning in the nfl our rookies today have that they have a world championship something thats part of a team history with me it was just trying to get to a winning season so the goals were different when i was a rookie versus the goals of our rookies today its really night and day to be honest and i think thats why i gained an appreciation to let these guys understand just how hard it is to succeed in this league you have to earn your right to be in this league its a privilege i think our guys on this team slowly start to understand that on a day by day basis that you have to earn your right and its a privilege to play in this league
1192240 you would hope that thats part of where they come from although thats something new that theyre going to have to go through because they dont know what its like to be in the nfl period i dont care what college program youve come from at the time with florida state and myself i felt that i was coming from a very sophisticated program and still when i got here it was a very humbling experience because i didnt know what to expect i think every young player everywhere is going to have to go through that until you know and then now you look for the growth process the guys that after they have been in the league for a year where are they going to grow are they going to teach the rookies behind them what they have learned for us we have had a pretty good system here in terms of showing our guys the ropes and how to do things and really learning what the word accountability means out here coach doesnt believe in hazing and we dont but through that we have certain ways that these guys are going to have to earn our respect and earn respect for themselves as to why they belong in the national football league you expect to be here you expect to win so you know there are certain things that you have to go through no matter what or where you came from for me i just treat people how i wanted to be treated when i was a rookie
1192241 with warrick obviously his role is a little different from what it was in the past and i think his role is going to be a little different but play a major part in what we do here in 2008 coach gruden for years has really taken advantage of the opportunity to get to coach warrick he expected to coach warrick in 2002 i think its going to be a unique situation that basically has been created for him to make plays on the offense and im excited to see it happen
1192242 the competition is intense at the receiving position thats one of the highly touted competitive positions going into camp that has been talked about written about and debated about on a daily basis one of these guys is going to have to step up and be a leader the guy that is going to have to take the pressure off of joey and you see it everyday these guys are taking advantage of every opportunity the season is going to be tough and our coaches and our personnel department know the direction we need to go in thats a good thing because all players in these particular cases are bringing out the best in each other these guys are showing up and its making it a real tough battle at the receiver position probably one of the better camps that all our receivers have had especially these past two or three days because each day one guy is stepping up and really doing something unprecedented in terms of making a catch making the quarterback look good making blocks recognizing defenses calling out blitzes i mean you name it our receivers are doing a pretty good job
1192243 you dont want to get too far ahead of ourselves in that capacity as i said before they are taking advantage of the opportunities presented in practice understand that weve been going against ourselves since april we cant get overly excited about that because we are going to see each other so many times those things are going to happen theres going to be a day of offense that takes advantage of the defense and a practice where the defense is going to take advantage of the offense thats kind of where you are at camp and you put a physical investment in your team and now you step back and start the game plan for a game now those things that youve talked about and that i have discussed the playmaking we want to see it happen in the game thats where you start to gain a sense of where our playmakers are at when the game happens you do have to start in practice and so far theyve made plays in practice and now you just want to see that happen come this weekend
1192244 hes been consistent and i think one of the best things about monte is that he is constantly finding new ways to challenge our defense you look at the success of our defensive categories in terms of turnover ratios that tells you everything about our franchise when we are winning the turnover battle we are winning games were winning in the playoffs and were winning division titles when were not playing better our offense is turning the ball over thats the one stat to me that correlates the success of our football team the turnover ratio every one of us has a say in that defense and offense in terms of kiffin hes finding new ways to challenge our defense hes tweaking our schemes here and there and another thing is that dont get the appreciation for it is the coaches that have coached with him it all starts with the head coach and particularly with the defensive assistants that have become head coaches under coach tony dungy and then to go down lower than that under his coordinator ship thats proof in the pudding in the type of people that have come in contact with him that get to learn from him i think if you talk to all the head coaches and the coordinators that have coached underneath him they all talk about how big of an influence that he has been on their philosophy and their way of coaching thats a bigger compliment that i could sit here and pay him myself to actually see the coaches that have coached with him pay him those compliments
1192245 it is different being in orlando at walt disney world but i think that the tempo is different and coach gruden takes care of his veterans i have had an opportunity to get a decent amount of reps but rest my body too
1192246 this is my first time playing for coach gruden so i have had to learn the playbook from scratch like any rookie that comes in the main thing is coming in and getting repetitions getting comfortable with it i do not really make many mistakes more like i did early on i just understand football and i think that coach gruden can see that i am in the right place it is a matter of taking the right steps and being in the right place at the right time
1192247 all i know is i am going to touch the football one of the things i wanted when atlanta released me is that i wanted to be involved this is a fresh start and coach gruden wants to get me involved in both facets the running game and the passing game i am looking forward to getting to the games and getting involved
1192248 i have heard that ever since i left tampa and coach gruden always greeted me and told me how he thought i was a great player now he has the opportunity to coach me and hopefully put me in positions to be successful but i have to do my part as well and play well
1192249 i have been around a lot longer than the two other guys michael bennett and earnest graham i thought earnest did a great job last season expanding his role with the team i think he wants his role to expand like any back if you are hungry and want to play you would have that mentality like any back would he graham is more of a pounder michael bennett if you give him some space he can make something happen because his speed is tremendous hopefully i can complement those guys and make them better not only on the field but off as well also when it comes to studying film and picking up on things in a meeting if i can help those guys advance their careers i am doing my part as a veteran
1192250 i think that the offensive line is very talented but they have not proven anything yet right now it is all talk so i expect those guys to have a chip on their shoulders and go out and play hard and play well if they can do that they are going to open up lanes i do not care who is behind there running they could average 4 to 5 yards a carry and that is what people are already saying proof has to be a part of this talk and if they do that we are going to be a good football team
1192251 honestly i never thought i would be back if cadillac carnell williams had not blew his knee out would i be here i do not think i would things happen for a reason the reason i left six years ago was not because i wanted to leave it was the circumstances now that i have an opportunity to come back i am going to enjoy the moment i have always loved the city of tampa and its fans when i have come back to play in the city i have always been greeted with hospitality and i am grateful for that it is great to being playing with guys that i have admired in derrick brooks and ronde barber and for a coach that i have always wondered if i could be successful in his offense now the challenge comes for us to be successful together
1192252 i was comfortable with the city and knew i did not have to find a place to live i knew the community and the direction this team was going based on their success from last year we are a team on the verge and i want to be a part of that i want to be champion i missed my opportunity to win a super bowl but now i want to be a part of some big games
1192253 my mom while she was on this earth taught me to be a charitable person because that is what she was while she was here
1192254 if you are going to live in a community you need to give back to the community
1192255 it is a coincidence that the super bowl is tampa but there is so much that comes with a season that we can only take it one week at a time we have to continue to improve and get better on offense then hopefully we would have that opportunity to play in that game for myself i have been so much through the last few years i just want to get to the playoffs hopefully if we stay healthy we can make things happen and give ourselves an opportunity playing the super bowl in tampa would be fitting a fairy tale ending

1192299 im not being glib here but we need to win more games as a conference and win in the tournament we can beat each other up during the regular season but the ncaa is when it matters most
1192300 maybe in 2007 if huntsville beats notre dame and niagara beats michigan in march 2008 it puts us in a bigger spotlight the league needs to win when it counts

1192334 this first of its kind global survey shows that there are people living with hiv and aids in the u s today who despite having access to treatments are choosing not to start or to discontinue arv therapy due to concerns about side effects
1192335 that so many patients are deferring treatment in an age when we have so many options is regrettable as for those patients who repeatedly discontinue their therapy without clinicians guidance there is a real danger of developing resistance to arv drugs furthermore treatment interruption without medical monitoring may result in accelerated disease progression it is imperative that physicians and patients address concerns about side effects openly and evaluate potential new and different treatment options that may be more tolerable
1192336 despite years of education and awareness raising around hiv and aids there are today people living with hiv and aids in america who are concerned about others knowing their hiv status because of societal discrimination and stigma

1192402 in general the philosophy is to move away from processed food and toward scratch cooking but how do you do that
1192403 weve got a lot of strong positives we just have to get through this difficult period

1192411 ayo makan dulu dari tadi kok di depan teve terus
1192412 bahkan ada yang untuk makan harus sambil nonton tv kalau tidak anaknya tak mau makan
1192413 nonton tv itu kan cenderung pasif tak ada interaksi dua arah beda jika ia main dengan teman temannya ia akan aktif entah fisiknya komunikasi atau sosial jadi ada timbal balik belajar saling memberi
1192414 anda tak bisa menjadikan tv sebagai baby sitter jika anda mau mendidik anak menjadi pemirsa yang kritis
1192415 jika anda menggunakan tv sebagai penjaga anak sehingga mengabaikan hubungannya dengan orang lain jelas anda lalai jika anda tak memperkenalkan buku kepada anak anak hanya karena adanya tv maka anda bertindak ceroboh jika anda tak membantu anak untuk membangun hubungan yang baik dengan teman sebayanya hanya karena tv menjaga mereka di rumah maka anda benar benar bersalah terhadap mereka

1192420 the smell was bad very bad i thought it was dead rats
1192421 my employees are complaining they want to go home their stomachs are hurting
1192422 we would have searched in a total probably around about the 20 square kilometres
1192423 were assuming that this person still is on foot were hoping that hes not injured in any way because that does obviously has a fairly big impact on his wellbeing
1192424 so what were trying to do is just make sure that we cover as much territory as carefully as possible to increase the chances of locating him safe and well
1192425 today weve got the surf lifesaving queensland helicopter on scene it arrived up there at 7 oclock this morning
1192426 its going to utilise its thermal imaging equipment just to run some low level flights up the creek beds and into the areas where we think he might be just to hopefully pick up some body warmth
1192427 the people who are locals around there say its some of the toughest terrain to encounter for bushwalkers and thats sometimes why the attraction is for people to go to that area
1192428 our main concern is that hes become ill or that hes become injured and then that makes it difficult for us in particular with the industrial deafness that he cant hear the searchers and they could be close by

1192430 as downtown transitions from large corporations to smaller businesses we want to find out what their challenges are
1192431 we want to tell them were very happy you look upon dayton as a place for your business
1192432 when we track job gains and losses downtown the vast majority of new jobs are from growing existing businesses
1192433 from a 50 000 feet perspective its got to be disappointing considering the rate we are moving
1192434 i am encouraged that business leaders want to change the environment downtown to better position the city to capture its share of the growth
1192435 we dont think its inappropriate nor irresponsible for the reserve bank to now consider easing the pain on australian businesses and in fact reducing interest rates
1192436 45 revolutions on my stereo not one revolution on the streets
1192437 it is troubling that there is a culture of infringement out there
1192438 in the am practice the veterans obviously knew what was going on
1192439 as far as the afternoon practice i think this freshman class is going to be a really good class a number of guys stood out receivers corners offensive linemen defensive linemen i like the way jordan jefferson learns he picks it up pretty quickly hes a long ways away from being ready to play but hes getting there
1192440 well i think its a little premature to be giving him the starting spot
1192441 but were very optimistic about him i cant imagine redshirting any big quarterback
1192442 they had a good command of the offense and understood whats going on
1192443 miles was also very pleased with the overall shape of the team as they reported to fall camp citing only one player that he felt still had a little more conditioning work to do
1192444 the heaviest guy on our team made his sprint test
1192445 he didnt really gain that much body fat were going to give him the chance to lose some weight but frankly hes not that far away and thatd be herman johnson the overall shape of the team is pretty good
1192446 we did virtually the same thing with the freshmen as we did with the varsity
1192447 the tempo of this mornings practice was really good in the afternoon we were more focused on coaching it was a pretty strong practice i kind of anticipated the guys that had been here all spring and all summer were going to catch on i was surprised though at how well jordan jefferson did he really had a nice afternoon
1192448 i think theres always competition at the safety spot for him jones
1192449 but any snaps where he is not in the game are mistakes we have got to play him i think thats the plan and those mistakes will not be made
1192450 ricky had a little medical issue but nothing thats terribly serious
1192451 its nothing thats going to keep him out of multiple practices but something that needed to be taken care of its a sensitive issue
1192452 his weight is up but his body fat is down so id say hes in pretty good shape
1192453 a sensuous craving for such things as the destiny of soldiers the tragic nature of their calling the ways they would die
1192454 in greece there had been however an equilibrium between the physical body and intelligence soma and sophia
1192455 the goal of my life was to acquire all the various attributes of the warrior
1192456 but my hearts yearning towards death and night and blood would not be denied
1192457 to keep death in mind from day to day to focus each moment upon inevitable death the beautiful death that had earlier eluded me world war ii had also become possible i was beginning to dream of my capabilities as a fighting man
1192458 it would he difficult to imagine a more heroic sight than that of the lieutenant at this moment
1192459 surely some god died when the ni ni roku incident failed i was only eleven at the time and felt little of it but when the war ended when i was twenty a most sensitive age i felt something of the terrible cruelty of the death of that god the positive picture was my boyhood impression of the heroism of the rebel officers their purity bravery youth and death qualified them as mythical heroes and their failures and deaths made them true heroes in this world
1192460 why did the emperor have to become a human being
1192461 we hereby swear to be the foundation of kokoku nippon imperial japan
1192462 the strongest enemy within the nation it is astonishing how little the character of modern intellectuals in japan has changed i e their cowardice sneering objectivity rootlessness dishonesty flunkeyism mock gestures of resistance self importance inactivity talkativeness and readiness to eat their words
1192463 i have discovered that the way of the samurai is death
1192464 it means specialisation and therefore the confinement of the individual into a single cog
1192465 ours is an age in which everything is based on the premise that it is best to live as long as possible the average life span has become the longest in history and a monotonous plan for humanity unrolls before us
1192466 the premise of the democratic age is that it is best to live as long as possibles
1192467 we are ignoring the fact that bringing death to the level of consciousness ic an important element of mental health hagakure insists that to ponder death daily is to concentrate daily on life when we do our work thinking that we may die today we cannot help feeling that our job suddenly becomes radiant with life and meaning
1192468 philosophy of extremism hence it is inherently out of character in a democratic society
1192469 the calculating man is a coward i say this because calculations have to do with profit and loss and such a person is therefore preoccupied with profit and loss to die is a loss to live is a gain and so one decides not to die therefore one is a coward similarly a man of education camouflages with his intellect and eloquence the cowardice or greed that is his true nature many people do not realise this
1192470 one does not offer oneself up bravely in the face of danger
1192471 the first thing a samurai says on any occasion is extremely important he displays with this one remark all the valour of the samurai
1192472 even in casual conversation a samurai must never complain he must constantly be on his guard lest he should let slip a word of weakness
1192473 the decadence of his era and the degeneration of the young samurai
1192474 the climate of an age is unalterable that conditions are worsening steadily is proof that we have entered the last stage of the law
1192475 however the season cannot always be spring or summer nor can we have daylight forever what is important is to make each era as good as it can be according to its na ture
1192476 japanese people today think of money just money where is our national spirit today the jieitai army must be the soul of japan
1192477 the nation has no spiritual foundation that is why you dont agree with me you will just be american mercenaries there you are in your tiny world you do nothing for japan
1192478 to choose the place where one dies is also the greatest joy in life

1192489 this is a tremendous victory for consumers which will allow us to make dvrs available to many more people faster and less expensively than would otherwise be possible
1192490 we appreciate the courts perspective that from the standpoint of existing copyright law remote storage dvrs are the same as the traditional dvrs that are in use today
1192491 we are going to take advantage of both centralized and distributed approaches where it makes sense
1192492 we could develop a centralized service that is similar to cablevisions but it doesnt preclude us from also leveraging hard drives in the home to do other things
1192493 we asked broadridge financial to doublecheck the votes it transmitted to yahoo on our behalf
1192494 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results

1192496 you could not see such things happen before in china because of the controlled media
1192497 you can see grassroots based technology helping people become empowered
1192498 if something happened in the world and there are 10 sources of information on this event even if i block nine you can get one thats enough for you you dont need the other nine resources once you get that information you can forward that to others
1192499 i dont think it will work to block or filter something
1192500 it was completely different from what i learned in school
1192501 its hard to believe the first time you see a different edition of history at first i felt its unbelievable then i felt angry because i was deceived for such a long time
1192502 it is not like i want to knock down the government or rise in rebellion against government officials
1192503 it is just a shame that there are many good tools and information that we cannot access and use
1192504 may result in serious injury or death as well as damage to the crane and other property
1192505 no cranes have failed due to this issue and affected parts have been corrected or are in the process of being corrected
1192506 it would be a big deal if one of these pieces of equipment failed
1192507 i guess jerry yang didnt come out of the meeting as unscathed as it seemed
1192508 we were surprised at the very high vote counts that were pro jerry yang
1192509 certainly the final results seemed very different from the exit polls
1192510 it seems odd that fewer shares would be voted this year compared to last when theres been such additional scrutiny on the company in the wake of the dealings with microsoft and carl icahn
1192511 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1192512 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1192513 capital research global investors asked broadridge financial to double check the votes it transmitted to yahoo on its behalf
1192514 i think jerry yang is still firmly in place until some deviation happens from the plan yahoo has set forth

1192586 i still remember how excited julie when she finally figured out how to stage the movies stampede sequence
1192587 she showed me the miniature model of that set how the rollers would turn and gradually reveal all of those wildebeests thundering down into that canyon
1192588 lion king was a musical and i dont do musicals
1192589 i remember taking my daughter with me to the new amsterdam
1192590 and i was amazed as well as intimidated by what i saw this was going to be the first time id ever been a replacement id never stepped into a moving production before i found the whole idea rather daunting
1192591 you basically learn as you go out there in front of the paying customers
1192592 the first time that i was out on stage in front of all those lights i kept thinking how long did i sign on to do this
1192593 she had me try on all these different versions of scars head
1192594 but all i could think about was the size of the contract that disney theatrical had had julie sign while i was in her workshop once she showed me a copy of the thing i remember it being as thick as a phone book never did i dream that 10 years later that id actually be in the show that julie was trying to create then
1192595 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
1192596 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
1192597 when rotten tomatoes andrew with tongue partially in cheek said that the real reason this lonely robot keeps watching
1192598 who designed all this i want a job like that
1192599 now betsy this generator produces a harmless electrical charge just like the static created when i rubbed the balloon with that flannel cloth after i start the motor ill ask you to touch the silver ball and the charge will go harmlessly through you and cause your lovely blond hair to stand straight up are you ready
1192600 now touch the metal ball just there and watch what happens
1192601 because if we get hit by a train were going to die and were going to hell
1192602 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
1192603 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
1192604 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
1192605 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
1192606 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
1192607 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
1192608 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
1192609 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
1192610 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
1192611 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
1192612 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
1192613 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
1192614 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
1192615 project still needs central government approval and shanghai will obey beijings decision
1192616 on theme parks we have ongoing discussions ongoing and ongoing and ongoing with the chinese government about a park in shanghai
1192617 to date our discussions have been with shanghai officials and now were talking with the national officials
1192618 and why is chinas central government willing to spend this sort of money on shanghai disneyland
1192619 disney will provide technology and capital for a 51 percent stake in a joint venture with shanghais government backed lujiazui group company which will contribute land near the pudong international airport
1192620 i was standing with a few thousand other people watching the parade go by and i realized that there wasnt a character in that parade that had come from a disney animated film in the last 10 years except for pixar
1192621 i was at the island this past weekend and the place was packed
1192622 this is surprising since an earlier thermal and evolved gas analyzer measurement of surface materials was consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate
1192623 while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1192624 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1192625 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms
1192626 edouard is not going to have that large of an affect on tourism because its not expected to cause severe damage
1192627 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1192628 crude futures are down despite a brewing storm and that shows you how momentum has shifted in this market
1192629 despite all these bullish inferences a lower market must mean that participants have an infinitely greater concern about a deteriorating global economy
1192630 lo que nosotros sabemos es que se trata de una organizaci n bien plantada bien organizada son varios sujetos operan mediante retenes donde capturan a los secuestrados

1192634 in the buffalo area alone we had 7 disney stores which is 6 too many to my way of thinking we want these stores to seem special and unique again which is why we have no plans at this time to add any new units to the chain
1192635 75 of our customers rating our guest service as superior to the best practices of other retailers including premier retailers such as macys
1192636 a middle to upper income female who is between the ages of 25 to 35 years old additionally she is predominantly a mother of young children mostly under the age of 12
1192637 our ultimate goal here is that the disney store will be different from all the other stores at the mall
1192638 that it once again will have a uniqueness and a specialness
1192639 theres only so much shelf space out there and this time around we had a really tough time selling wall e against speed racer
1192640 simon cowell though given this performer will actually be working off of a wdi approved script one wonders how mean hell actually be able to be here
1192641 ah mrs corry a story for you your daughters was shorter than you but they grew
1192642 i cant play miss andrew as bad shes just a nanny whos not up on these new fangled methods she still believes that children should be seen and not heard
1192643 boring just like other nannies thinking parks are good for us its just statues ducks and grannies i dont understand all the fuss
1192644 based on the stories of p l travers and the walt disney film
1192645 these are as good if not better than the ones ive had in spain
1192646 reasonable suspicion is not needed for customs officials to search a laptop or other personal electronic storage devices at the border
1192647 i realized that some on boards maybe all are partially software driven much like the winmodems i have read that asus mobos are fake raid so this got me a bit worried about raid compatibility with linux can anyone recommend or provide guidance on motherboards with integral raid 1 that work will with linux ubuntu 8 04 on dell c400 labtop pclinuxos 2007 amp xp on home built desktop tamoneya chocolate covered ubuntu beans re seek new mobo but raid real or fake unless you pay up for server hardware you arent going to get real hardware raid the best thing to do is to make a software raid that is what i have on my desktop it has more over head on the cpu but with the multi core speed of todays cpus you wont even notice it desktop q6600 oc 343 x 9 4 gb ram 8600 gts twinview 22
1192648 my catchment area in bressay is 160 odd houses and 400 people
1192649 in the run up to opening their store tesco ran an ad showing a shopping trolley with food many their own brand which cost less than 20
1192650 the total cost came to 20 78 that may be more than tesco but for someone to take their wife and car over to lerwick on the ferry costs 11 10 by shopping with us people will save 10
1192651 the same goods in the mail shop bressay 20 78 no travelling no ferry fares no queueing no hassle the choice is yours no tesco own brands
1192652 it was all a bit tongue in cheek it is not as if we are in direct competition with tesco but the locals had a laugh and we had a good positive response
1192653 this shows competition is alive and well in the retail sector and the true winners are the customers in the shetland isles
1192654 pams daughter called to let us know she died on tuesday

1192670 last year we had a really good pre season and won almost every game and then after 50 seconds against fulham on the opening day we were behind so it is hard to say
1192671 hopefully we can get some confidence out of the first few games and can slowly build it up if you lose the first few games you are not at your maximum
1192672 i think any of the top four can win the title

1192711 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed

1192720 there are hundreds of people that should be in the star with us were lucky to be here
1192721 at first i was frightened of being overwhelmed by all those old feelings there was a big part of me that didnt want to be reminded of who i was back then but then i started to feel that maybe this was something i had to do
1192722 when it was over i was finally proud to be a spice girl all those frightened negative mixed feelings had disappeared

1192724 the research of the american dr lauren pristas has not been noted by many

1192731 growth is expected to pick up in the december 2008 quarter owing to the combined effects of tax cuts on oct 1 2008 recovery from the drought high export prices the weakening new zealand dollar and more reductions in the official cash rate
1192732 oil is down but its because global growth is slowing the panacea that people thought a decline in oil would be has not come to pass
1192733 now the bear market is rolling on to energy commodity and tech stocks
1192734 with crude oil and gold down there seems to be a wave of selling in the commodity fertilizer stocks there is a general feeling that the worldwide economies are slowing
1192735 i guess jerry yang didnt come out of the meeting as unscathed as it seemed
1192736 we were surprised at the very high vote counts that were pro jerry yang
1192737 certainly the final results seemed very different from the exit polls
1192738 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1192739 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1192740 capital research global investors asked broadridge financial to double check the votes it transmitted to yahoo on its behalf
1192741 i think jerry yang is still firmly in place until some deviation happens from the plan yahoo has set forth
1192742 the first court gave him a sentence of five years in prison but the second court set a sex criminal free in a judgment heedless of how it left the disabled defenselessly exposed to sexual assault
1192743 the crime took place over three years ago but common sense has still not prevailed over the lack of it we will not be discouraged by this ruling but will overcome it like ivy climbing a wall and continue to work for the human rights of the disabled

1192749 i have tested the computers and am happy with their performance
1192750 they are wireless internet based designs and need not be connected to fixed lines to reduce costs they do not have hard discs you use a thumb drive instead

1192753 well if there were fewer cows because people stopped eating them
1192754 sexuality is what society will turn its head for more than anything else
1192755 feminists should stop eating meat because here are a bunch of anecdotes about how men treat women like meat and about how pornography looks at women like meat and how meat is thought of vital to masculinity therefore it is imperative to you as a feminist who are disgusted by all pornography all erotic representations of women and masculinity in general to stop eating meat out of principle
1192756 how many years is it going to take before the gay community acknowleges that homosexuality is an immutable
1192757 and i believe that what we will see today is barack obama attempting to paint a picture of an energy plan that frankly is not based on developing more american energy supply i believe that anyone who says that we can achieve energy independence in this country without that without more nuclear power without more offshore drilling without more clean coal doesnt have the experience to understand the problem we are faced with or isnt being straightforward to the american people
1192758 we are here on the call today to really begin to look at what we are going to hear for the rest of the day which is the unveiling of barack obamas energy plan for the future
1192759 so it is clear that this is an issue that is very important to our economy and to the families of america and i believe that what we will see today is barack obama attempting to paint a picture of an energy plan that frankly is not based on developing more american energy supply i believe that anyone who says that we can achieve energy independence in this country without that without more nuclear power without more offshore drilling without more clean coal doesnt have the experience to understand the problem we are faced with or isnt being straightforward to the american people
1192760 i think the case has been very well laid out and i will simply echo two things
1192761 its an aggressive plan and his goal is to leave our dependence by 2025
1192762 its time for leadership on this issue that is what senator mccain has presented the american people with a path forward so that were no longer held hostage to foreign oil markets its an aggressive plan senator obama has shown no leadership on this issue indeed his tendency to just go along is one on which he has a track record of in the u s senate sticking with the party line not bucking his backers or his party to cast tough votes and provide leadership on real issues for the american people so this is more of the same for barack obama

1192781 could you fault the city of san francisco for wanting to create a healthier population
1192782 whatever we can do as a society to encourage healthy living benefits all of us
1192783 telling people whats in food and not also changing what they have access to is unlikely to change the obesity epidemic
1192784 patients have said in smoking cessation classes im tired of being a social outcast
1192785 theres a stigma of having to go outside and now youre going to go farther

1192982 the other day i checked my email and found that i had an email from president bush no not a personal email but an email explaining why i should support john mccain and the republican party this november you really should register on the gops website because some of the stuff they send you for free offers more comedic relief than a paid admission to a comedy club i really should register with the donkey party site as well their stuff is probably even funnier
1192983 his dr grene talk had locked me in silence i know not why it was not opening easy happy talk like my fathers after all i wanted to listen to him but i did not want to answer now that strange responsibility we feel towards others when they speak to offer them the solace of any answer poor humans and anyway he had not asked a question he was merely floating there in the room insubstantial a living man in the midst of life dying imperceptibly on his feet like all of us
1192984 too much thinking on death yet it is the music of our time
1192985 there has never been a person in an old peoples home that hasnt looked around dubiously at the other inhabitants they are the old ones they are the club that no one wants to join but we are never old to ourselves that is because at the close of the day the ship we sail in is the soul not the body
1192986 official data are starting to reveal what close observers have suspected for some time layoffs are increasing unemployment is on the rise it now stands at a four year high of 5 7 percent which is not high by historical standards but it stings when you consider that the rate dipped below 4 percent in the late 1990s what worries people is the trend line this is the seventh straight month of reported job declines
1192987 paul krugman is too sophisticated to think that more regulation will temper excessive risk taking in financial markets another temporary fix july 28 he should know that the more restrictive the regulations the more opportunities conniving executives have to work the system look at the case of angelo mozilo and countrywide mozilo and his company thrived on regulation and they used it to their advantage

1192992 after my experiences playing odi and t20 cricket for england and in the ipl with the rajasthan royals i really feel like i have something to offer otago in terms of leadership and experience

1192994 sanzars current position is that it is a very much a three country expansion of super rugby with south africa involved
1192995 the trans tasman idea does not include south africa and that is absolutely not the nzrus preferred position at the moment
1192996 at this stage sanzar are unified in new zealand australia and south african teams being involved in super rugby and tri nations going forward
1192997 sanzar needs to remain very very strong particularly in todays rugby environment which is very trying
1192998 this one has been mooted before we have been over some of these ideas over the last few weeks
1192999 there is nothing dead in the water at the moment because reviews are taking place over the next 12 months and we are happy for all options to be included happy for any suggestions to come forward from any people whether it is players sponsors provincial unions or franchises

1193005 using a unique state law police in connecticut have disarmed dozens of gun owners based on suspicions that they might harm themselves or others the states gun seizure law is considered the first and only law in the country that allows the confiscation of a gun before the owner commits an act of violence police and state prosecutors can obtain seizure warrants based on concerns about someones intentions many gun owners dont get their seized firearms back courts ordered guns held in more than one third of the documented seizures since 1999 judges directed guns destroyed turned over to someone else or sold in more than 40 other cases

1193007 im not too sure yet on what im going to do things are still up in the air
1193008 a lot of the senior players can say theyre not going but itd be tougher for the younger players who are trying to fight for a place in the team
1193009 if the securitys not great you dont want to risk everything for that
1193010 up and down a poor start and a good finish pretty much how the team went as well
1193011 i had a little back problem that cleared up then after the first test i got a virus stomach bug that meant i wasnt able to train for the second test i didnt have a good start to the one day series but in the third one day international at bristol i produced a spell that was the best ive felt for a long time that gave me a lot of confidence its amazing what a few wickets can do
1193012 weve never really established ourselves as a test playing nation we can tip up some sides but not win consistently and so were trying to fix that a lot lies with us playing a lot more but were also a very young team at the moment and i can see us getting a lot better with age
1193013 im just trying to take every chance i get i want to cement a spot in the nz side for as long as i can
1193014 use of ict in journalism online media and role of blogging in raising awareness

1193019 all of us have been shut down because of olympic security
1193020 repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
1193021 now after john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
1193022 repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord
1193023 and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead
1193024 shallow preaching that does not grapple with the terrible fact of mans sinfulness and guilt preaching that does not call on men everywhere to repent that kind of preaching results in shallow conversions and so we have myriads of glib tongued professors today who give no evidence of regeneration whatsoever they go about prating about being saved by grace but they manifest no grace in their lives
1193025 they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick
1193026 well im not concerned im getting along fine thank you

1193028 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death
1193029 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church
1193030 only in christ are all things in communion he is the point of convergence of all hearts and beings and therefore the bridge and the shortest way from each to each
1193031 the doctrine of justification by faith is in fact the great ecumenical doctrine

1193042 porque no hay en este momento un impedimento legal para ello
1193043 tenemos varios d as por delante los partidos son indispensables para la sociedad pero son insuficientes el ejercicio democr tico no termina ah hay 96 de jaliscienses que no participa en partidos pol ticos adem s hay voces del sector empresarial que insisten en controversia constitucional pero tampoco es un sector que deba definir la decisi n del poder ejecutivo el gobierno no actuar bajo presi n
1193044 para que haya una controversia constitucional el gobierno podr a argumentar que se vio afectado por alguna de las decisiones que se haya tomado en el poder legislativo nada m s de alguna pero en el tema de la parte presupuestal s lo podr a argumentar que no tiene los recursos pero ser a delicado
1193045 pero quien llev adelante la reuni n fue el propio gobernador y le dijimos que necesita construirse una mayor confianza entre ambos poderes
1193046 todo lo que se se ala debe echarse a andar como lo es el financiamiento a partidos la reestructuraci n del instituto electoral y todos los temas relacionados entonces entrando ya en vigor la ley el c digo electoral ya ma ana mismo puede la comisi n legislativa de asuntos electorales lanzar la convocatoria
1193047 parte del enojo de algunos l deres empresariales tiene que ver con que los partidos ya no vamos a depender de ellos le han echado m s ganas a esto que a cualquier tema como competitividad o inseguridad es incre ble que se al en y muestren tanta beligerancia les horroriza que los partidos no dependamos de los empresarios que los candidatos los virtuales candidatos no dependan de los compromisos que puedan hacer con empresarios
1193048 l nunca me ha planteado la posibilidad de hacerlo pero si lo plantea
1193049 la reforma est aprobada tiene aspectos que al pan le parecen positivos en lo general aunque habr cosas que hubi ramos preferido de otra forma pero sobre todo por los tiempos irse a controversia en estos momentos podr a implicar que se aplique la vieja ley electoral lo cual implica que no hay reducci n de diputados en el congreso que no hay regulaci n de precampa as que no hay facultades de fiscalizaci n que para nosotros son importantes y me parece que estos asuntos de financiamiento pues debieron haberse planteado hace meses cuando el gobernador y el secretario general de gobierno conoc an perfectamente el tema incluso antes de que se presentara la iniciativa

1193074 it used to take us a week to make one traditional bubu fish trap as we would have to walk a day or two into the forest to find the material from trees
1193075 everyone in this village is interested even the women are trying their hand at making this new type of fish trap
1193076 choosing alternative species helps to ease the pressure on stocks of more traditional fish basa has had a meteoric rise our palate tends to appreciate fish that are not strong flavoured and basa is one those it has a texture and taste that is quite similar to a white sea fish
1193077 people are becoming more adventurous partly in response to tv chefs happy to cook different types of fish and partly because retailers and processors are much more focused on sourcing fish responsibly
1193078 people are experimenting with more fish and basa is a very acceptable type of fish there is no bone and it fries very well
1193079 its fun to get to see the roots and spread them all out
1193080 our city forest is teaching the scouts how to care for the outdoor environment and to provide for the future
1193081 im a big green oxygen machine im also a habitat for birds and squirrels and i shade the environment
1193082 two years from now the trees will be transplanted throughout the county
1193083 some may go to school yards some may go to parks and some to local neighborhoods that dont have a lot of trees
1193084 that means leaving the environment better than they found it
1193085 our method tells law enforcement officials this is where you need to be looking for poachers
1193086 we suspected that the ivory scraps from that raid and the tusks and ivory hankos in singapore came from the same population of elephants
1193087 wasser is doing whats needed figuring out where on the ground the poaching is happening
1193088 according to the meteorology agency this years dry season is very dry not wet like last year thats the problem
1193089 looking at the fluctuation of hot spots this year could be worse than last
1193090 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1193091 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1193092 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1193093 the situation could well have been as bad as this say five years ago we just didnt know but now we have a much better indication of the state of the worlds primates and the news is not good
1193094 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1193095 one of many not so angry compassionate conservative white guy listeners
1193096 greetings from a long time 2 years at least downloader of the abw show
1193097 your show is very enjoyable and the content is excellent i enjoy your point of view on the many subjects that you cover and think that you always hit on things that people are thinking but are afraid to say its good to hear someone voice her opinion on relevant topics of today concerning not only black people or black women but things that affect everyone
1193098 you were awesome as a guest on wwwt fm good job on discussing a wide array of topics including politics news education obese kids terrible prom attire etc im looking forward to winning more sunny james converts
1193099 i have found your podcasts to be informative educational and entertaining in fact i got a pair of dress shoes repaired after listening to one of your podcasts thanks i saved some money that day
1193100 when the politicians complain that tv turns the proceedings into a circus it should be made clear that the circus was already there and that tv has merely demonstrated that not all the performers are well trained
1193101 through this device we hope to create awareness among the households about saving energy
1193102 before that we didnt know because theres no dollars and cents i have nine rooms and if no one is in the rooms and all of us are in the hall watching tv and all the nine room lights are on it consumes a lot of electricity
1193103 its a good idea but i dont want to spend more money to see how much im spending on electricity bills
1193104 my daughter saw on television a call for entries to join a reality show energy saves
1193105 since being on the programme weve managed to monitor our expenditure and switched to energy efficient appliances
1193106 it will motivate you to use energy more efficiently and thus help you to reduce your utility bill
1193107 green carbon the role of natural forests in carbon storage
1193108 natural forests are more resilient to climate change and disturbances than plantations
1193109 protecting the carbon in natural forests is preventing an additional emission of carbon from what we get from burning fossil fuel
1193110 the majority of biomass carbon in natural forests resides in the woody biomass of large old trees commercial logging changes the age structure of forests so that the average age of trees is much younger
1193111 the carbon stock of forests subject to commercial logging and of monoculture plantations in particular will therefore always be significantly less on average than the carbon stock of natural undisturbed forests
1193112 in australia and probably globally the carbon carrying capacity of natural forests is underestimated and therefore misrepresented in economic valuations and in policy options
1193113 i wish i found you 3 years ago it would have saved a lot of tears plus money on math tutoring
1193114 i am completely amazed i had no idea such an approach would really work
1193115 this has done in 1 hour what we all couldnt do in 2 years of hard work
1193116 vamos a llevar una programaci n para afectar lo menos posible las calles y a la ciudadan a
1193117 estamos viendo la posibilidad de interponer un amparo pero queremos un amparo que est muy bien fundamentado para que no nos lo echen abajo
1193118 vamos a estar perjudicados sobre todo las fincas que tengan a su alrededor el mont n de edificios porque no les van a permitir la entrada de luz si ahorita puedes salirte al patio en ropa interior que yo acostumbro hacerlo pues ya no lo vamos a poder hacer
1193119 we have excellent political relations both parties have eagerness to improve economic and commercial relations too
1193120 there is need to find a solution to the palestinian issue urgently we are concerned about developments in iraq threat of terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction cause a great concern for our countries and the region
1193121 we believe that we are prepared to deal with any kind of security threat and we are confident and capable of hosting a peaceful and safe games
1193122 the uighur people do not support acts that engender bloodshed
1193123 to view chinese government accounts regarding uighur terrorist acts with caution as government authorities consistently fail to provide evidence to back up their claims
1193124 this is the time period every year where we do see porpoises and dolphins washed up ashore it does happen
1193125 we want to take a look and see if thats possible in harbor porpoises is that occurring here
1193126 if there are changes in the amount of ice cover in the antarctic then it means there are going to be changes in the amount of habitat that the whales have available to them
1193127 and were not sure how adaptable they are to living in a different kind of habitat
1193128 it s a great way to build content rich niche sites and use the power of youtube at the same time
1193129 people who dont remember the past are condemned to repeat it
1193130 over the past eight years weve moved it steadily forward evolving the way we measure and rate building performance and doing so against a backdrop of increasing urgency to find solutions to climate change and energy dependence
1193131 we dont want leed to be a one size fits all but we wanted to make sure we didnt have 50 or 500 different versions of leed out there
1193132 the ratio of importance of those points has gone up
1193133 we needed to make some significant improvements given leeds popularity
1193134 we almost did some of this work way back in 2001 the decision at that time was we cant change too much because the market needs to catch up to it
1193135 the u s green building council experienced extreme growth that outpaced all expectations
1193136 ultimately leed is something that needs to progress but it takes a lot to re learn this
1193137 leed has evolved as market awareness has increased and this is precisely what 2009 is doing
1193138 all of these issues are being taken into account with leed its always been somewhat of a living document
1193139 the idea is when you look at leed today it wont look significantly different than leed 2009
1193140 now we have a system set up to very easily improve as we as a building industry improve
1193141 by adopting this first in the nation statewide green building code california is again
1193142 with todays action california continues to lead the nation and i commend the hard
1193143 its a shame weve got to come out and protest and try to get whats ours it seems like they would give to us anyway because as everybody know marting luther king came here in 1968 and died for the sanitation workers
1193144 the idea you can invent something that can change the way people feel about themselves and their quality of life thats what its all about for me
1193145 in some cases if i think its somebody who deserves to have one i do it because its what i think i should do
1193146 it made me feel very happy and blessed that there are people still out there who have hearts
1193147 improving our built environment is probably the single greatest opportunity to protect and enhance the natural environment this report is a blueprint for dramatic environmental progress throughout north america mostly using the tools and technology we have on hand today
1193148 green building represents some of the ripest low hanging fruit for achieving significant reductions in climate change emissions
1193149 as a developer i rely on the fact that green building is a proven concept with construction costs and market benefits that are rapidly improving this report shows what is needed to scale up and put green building at the heart of a healthy energy secure north america
1193150 green building is a cornerstone for creating strong sustainable communities in seattle we are convinced that cities that make the commitment and investment in green development now will have a significant advantage in the long run
1193151 the greenest large city in the united states of america
1193152 we are thrilled that l a is now going to start reducing its co2 if l a implemented our ordinance it would have an even greater impact for all angelenos
1193153 san franciscos department of the environment is a robust well funded agency led by professionals with experience in green building
1193154 i dont know what to tell you its a different group up there
1193155 we looked at this as the socially responsible thing to do
1193156 im not an ardent environmentalist but it makes economic sense to us it was a no brainer
1193157 perhaps the most powerful driver behind the move toward green development in the office sector is tenant demand
1193158 for some businesses particularly large multinational companies shareholder pressures have been a powerful catalyst in their newfound interest in greenhouse gas emissions because real estate accounts for a significant share of most companies aggregate greenhouse gas emissions green buildings offer an obvious and effective way for companies to demonstrate their commitment to the environment
1193159 its crystal clear to us that a focus on sustainability has become important to the fortune 500 and similar companies around the world
1193160 san francisco is the farthest ahead of the green curve
1193161 on the landlord side there are some very savvy and forward thinking owners in a holistic sense between tenants landlords and the design and construction communities everyone seems to have some knowledge of green
1193162 were competing against non leed buildings downtown when gateway tower is complete its going to be a real advantage
1193163 id much rather be in our position than theirs the awareness is going to get there
1193164 if green buildings lease up rapidly like they have in other markets thats going to raise awareness right away the way to get peoples attention is to have a successful project that makes money
1193165 the demand and the desire for sustainable design whether its leed or energy star in the last six or eight months has shown up
1193166 our clients are asking us to inform and educate them so they can make good decisions on the cost and benefit of all the green components
1193167 what does it cost how do we get there if theyre not asking those questions were pushing the envelope to make sure theyre thinking about it
1193168 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple things but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tuneups youd actually save just as much
1193169 deceased box if theyre living leave the living box checked
1193170 the information weve discovered is very compelling like all good science we discovered it by accident
1193171 green buildings are clearly achieving higher rents and higher occupancy they have lower operating costs and theyre achieving higher sale prices
1193172 we wanted to take each and every one of these green buildings in our database and compare them to the buildings they directly compete with in the submarket
1193173 theres a bit of urgency now that the value of buildings could be affected if they are not leed certified
1193174 in large part they were referring to leed certification as a component in the definition of a class a office building
1193175 they basically said if youre building today without leed youre building in obsolescence
1193176 the business case is so strong that the financial results can be applied to asset value through increased noi net operating income or leveraged to pursue other aspects of green buildings that do not show as strong of a financial rate of return

1193178 quantifiable indicator of superior management practices across the property which may otherwise be intangible
1193179 we think of energy star and leed in concert with each other
1193180 leed and energy star come up in every investment we make they come up in the investment committee they come up in asset management committee meetings both are part of our fabric
1193181 if we lease buildings faster and hang on to tenants longer that adds to the economic equation
1193182 and obviously if youre selling a building at a lower cap rate thats additional icing on the cake
1193183 our investors recognize we are a national leader in sustainability and put a value on that and as they assess their advisors they see the leadership were taking in rpi and give us points if you will as they assess us amongst our competitors and thats good for business

1193192 as an attorney whose own practice is entirely in environmental law i am pleased to let clients know that our firm is undertaking its own green initiative
1193193 one of the most effective ways to become more environmentally efficient is to move to a greener building followed by reducing paper consumption and traveling less
1193194 i think that green initiatives can and should encompass much more than being the tenant in a green building
1193195 our profession has a long and adverse reputation for burning through paper and energy and other wasteful practices
1193196 at the end of the year when your managing partner is evaluating your value to the firm your answer should hopefully be in terms of dollars and clients not in wattage gallons and reams

1193198 we will all come to the point in our life where we have to admit that we feel defeated that something has conquered us we must change not because we want to but because we desperately have to we can not take life in its current suffocating state even to admit such desperation shows that we are feeling deserted wandering the barren desert a shell of our former selves it is only up from here it is impossible to sink any lower into ourselves or our circumstances but we can be salvaged a deliverance no vice can stand no fix can take the thorn in the side can be removed but you have to be willing to admit and surrender surrender your habits your lifestyle your past your present and your future this is your new surrender the new surrender

1193203 then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord
1193204 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first
1193205 in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed

1193219 kebanyakan ulama hadits menilai bahwa hadits hadits yang berbicara tentang malam nishfu syaban masuk kategori hadits dloif lemah namun ibn hibban menilai sebagaian hadits itu shohih dan beliau memasukkannya dalam kitab shohihnya
1193220 para ulama hadits ulama fiqh dan ulama ulama lainnya sebagaimana juga dikatakan oleh imam nawawi bersepakat terhadap diperbolehkannya menggunakan hadits dloif untuk keutamaan amal fadloilul amal bukan untuk menentukan hukum selama hadits hadits itu tidak terlalu dloif sangat lemah
1193221 beberapa hadits dan atsar telah diriwayatkan tentang keutamaan malam nisyfu syaban bahwa sekelompok ulama salaf telah melakukan sholat pada malam tersebut
1193222 jika tiba malam nisyfi syaban maka bersholatlah di malam harinya dan berpuasalah di siang harinya karena sesungguhnya allah subhanahu wataala menurunkan rahmatnya pada malam itu ke langit dunia yaitu mulai dari terbenamnya matahari
1193223 doa adalah senjatanya seorang mukmin tiyangnya agama dan cahayanya langit dan bumi
1193224 seorang muslim yang berdoa selama tidak berupa sesuatu yang berdosa dan memutus famili niscaya allah subhanahu wataala menganugrahkan salah satu dari ketiga hal pertama allah akan mengabulkan doanya di dunia kedua allah baru akan mengabulkan doanya di akhirat kelak ketiga allah akan menghindarkannya dari kejelekan lain yang serupa dengan isi doanya
1193225 bahwa saya melihat rasulullah pada malam nishfu syaban melakukan sholat empat belas rekaat setelahnya membaca surat al fatihah 14 x surah al ikhlas 14 x surah al falaq 14 x surah annas 14 x ayat kursi 1 x dan satu ayat terkhir surat at taubah 1 x
1193226 barang siapa yang melakukan apa yang telah kamu saksikan tadi maka dia akan mendapatkan pahala 20 kali haji mabrur puasa 20 tahun dan jika pada saat itu dia berpuasa maka ia seperti berpuasa dua tahun satu tahun yang lalu dan setahun yang akan datang

1193233 here is the truth fighting a war without end will not force the iraqis to take responsibility for their own future and fighting in a war without end will not make the american people safer so when i am commander in chief i will set a new goal on day one i will end this war not because politics compels it not because our troops cannot bear the burden as heavy as it is but because it is the right thing to do for our national security and it will ultimately make us safer
1193234 our countrys greatest military asset is the men and women who wear the uniform of the united states when we do send our men and women into harms way we must also clearly define the mission prescribe concrete political and military objectives seek out advice of our military commanders evaluate the intelligence plan accordingly and ensure that our troops have the resources support and equipment they need to protect themselves and fulfill their mission

1193255 it doesnt matter where the 2020 olympic games are held
1193256 but many of us whove experienced international twenty20 cricket and the ipl are convinced that cricket should bid to become an olympic sport in time for the games
1193257 we have a responsibility to grow our game in new territories and amongst the women of the world
1193258 i believe the olympic games is the vehicle the sport should use to aggressively sell the message of our sport to all 202 competing olympic nations
1193259 so that our sport is strong and robust in countries where it is currently played and exciting and ground breaking in countries who havent yet caught the cricket bug
1193260 with twenty20 cricket here to stay now is the time for the 10 full member nations of the icc to plan for the development of the sport over the next 100 years

1193266 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1193267 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1193268 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making
1193269 our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season
1193270 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there

1193273 this latest rain probably slowed us down with harvest here at the center we were talking about by the end of the week harvesting but it looks like it will probably be sometime next week we will do some of our plots some the farmers have some crops that are laying down in swaths so they may have some germination problems or preharvest sprouting
1193274 yeah or what do you want to see different or what kept you away what would keep you away next year anything that we can do better is what we wanna try and do

1193276 our advertisement on television and the internet is very very good except for local television

1193278 we dont see ourselves taking a stake in print because it is not available and because we wont want to take just a 26 percent stake
1193279 we are happy here the slower expansion of the economy may slow growth a bit but in the long term there is a lot of growth to be had
1193280 a lot of countries have restrictions in the media but with the expansion of the internet the rules are getting ridiculous

1193286 we have decent insurance coverage so im not concerned about this years survival but its next year that our inputs are going to be out of this world and thats what concerns me the most
1193287 the inputs are sky high higher than ever and it had been nice to put a little in the bank to offset some of that but if we can come in at the break even level then next year who knows

1193356 most subjects typically assume a hunched position in a corner of the bottom of the apparatus one might presume at this point that they find their situation to be hopeless
1193357 kept this going to the point where it was clear to many people that the work was really violating ordinary sensibilities that anybody with respect for life or people would find this offensive its as if he sat down and said im only going to be around another ten years what id like to do then is leave a great big mess behind if that was his aim he did a perfect job

1193359 this was a truly despicable crime committed by deadly brutal young men who were deadly dangerous to anyone who might find themselves near them all five were sentenced to death by separate juries after hearing all of the evidence in each of their individual trials
1193360 no matter how long the courts of this state this nation or any other nation review re review and re review once again the disgusting facts of this crime and these perpetrators the result should be the same these juries reached a reasonable verdict beyond a reasonable doubt that a sentence of death was the only appropriate punishment under texas law

1193366 como el arquero no lanza con acierto la saeta si no mira primero al blanco al que la env a y esto es necesario sobre todo cuando la v a es spera y dif cil y el camino laborioso y por esto fue conveniente que manifestase a sus disc pulos la gloria de su claridad que es los mismo que transfigurarse pues en esta claridad transfigurar a los suyos

1193368 en la claridad soberana que quiso fuese visible para estos tres hombres reflejando lo espiritual de una manera adecuada a la naturaleza humana pues rodeados todav a de la carne mortal era imposible que pudieran ver ni contemplar aquella inefable e inaccesible visi n de la misma divinidad que est reservada en la vida eterna para los limpios de coraz n

1193370 no se lleva ya una cruz cualquiera se descubre la cruz de cristo con el consuelo de que se encarga el redentor de soportar el peso
1193371 yo quisiera exhortaba a los fieles que fueseis capaces de entrever en la iglesia la luz que lleva dentro de descubrir a la iglesia transfigurada de comprender todo lo que el concilio ha expuesto tan claramente en sus documentos
1193372 la iglesia a ad a encierra una realidad misteriosa un misterio profundo inmenso divino la iglesia es el sacramento el signo sensible de una realidad escondida que es la presencia de dios entre nosotros

1193450 los agronegocios con la soja a la cabeza son sin nimo de desmontes degradaci n de suelos contaminaci n eliminaci n de otros cultivos destrucci n de la biodiversidad y expulsi n siempre de forma violenta de campesinos y pueblos originarios hacia los m rgenes de las grandes ciudades
1193451 el avance del modelo agroexportador trajo innumerables conflictos legales a las familias asentadas en las tierras desde hace d cadas los cambios clim ticos sumados a los avances tecnol gicos hicieron de las viejas y olvidadas tierras santiague as un para so para grandes empresarios con la soja las tierras se tornaron un bien preciado
1193452 as como hoy nadie puede discutir el genocidio de la dictadura en 30 a os va pasar lo mismo con el saqueo de los recursos naturales por el desastre producido por la soja la miner a y las pasteras
1193453 repudiamos el lockout agropecuario que expresa la ambici n ego sta de los agronegocios modelo que devast y saque los bienes naturales que ganaron millones de d lares y ahora quieren m s y por sobre todo repudiamos el modelo de agronegocios actual que es la cuesti n de fondo y que atenta contra la vida campesina ind gena
1193454 rol c mplice en la devastaci n de bosques y desalojos de comunidades rurales
1193455 el gobierno durante a os ha fomentado los agronegocios y casi no existen pol ticas destinadas a las comunidades campesinas ind genas
1193456 est claro que no somos parte de ese campo con soja super vit y dirigentes ricachones nucleados en entidades tradicionales que nunca han metido las manos en la tierra y que explotan a nuestros compa eros ellos reclaman por sus retenciones nosotros denunciamos el saqueo de este modelo agropecuario de monocultivo donde el peso de sostenerlo recae sobre las comunidades campesinas e ind genas malvendiendo su producci n o siendo mano de obra explotada de estos se ores
1193457 creemos en un modelo que apueste a un pueblo soberano activo en la toma de decisiones que lo afectan y no tomar decisiones a favor de la rentabilidad de las empresas o las entidades tradicionales que son socias en el negocio junto al gobierno con algunas peleas como en este paro patronal pero luego se amigan y contin an los negocios
1193458 que produzca la variedad de alimentos que necesita y no que vengan las multinacionales semilleras y qu micas a imponer qu debemos producir
1193459 el campo a nivel mundial atraviesa una nueva etapa marcada por la transnacionalizaci n del capital la utilizaci n de nuevas tecnolog as y un impacto social y ambiental silenciado tendencia potenciada por el auge de los agrocombustibles
1193460 muchos federados como lo llaman ellos intentaron e intentan desalojar habitantes ancestrales y muchos de nuestros compa eros son explotados por sus chacareros sin duda entendemos y defendemos el campo de distinta forma
1193461 en la d cada del 70 el movimiento rural germen de las m ticas ligas agrarias estaba en decidida oposici n a la faa se alumbraba un camino in dito el campesinado sent a que pod a avanzar m s leg timamente desprendi ndose del lastre de las organizaciones que como la propia faa hab an servido tradicionalmente a los campesinos ricos y grandes propietarios en desmedro de los campesinos pobres y medios
1193462 ya hubo intoxicaciones despu s de cada fumigaci n tienen que ir al hospital lo que no pudieron hacer con las topadoras lo quieren lograr con el veneno para la soja
1193463 los s ntomas de envenenamiento incluyen irritaciones d rmicas y oculares n useas y mareos edema pulmonar descenso de la presi n sangu nea reacciones al rgicas dolor abdominal p rdida masiva de l quido gastrointestinal v mito p rdida de conciencia destrucci n de gl bulos rojos cambios de coloraci n de piel quemaduras diarrea falla card aca electrocardiogramas anormales y da o renal

1193465 momento de parto el beb no llora la madre desespera el ni o est muerto
1193466 empezaron a aparecer dos patolog as la muerte de beb s durante el parto y muerte fetal precoz situaci n donde se produce el embarazo la bolsa la placenta pero no se produce el beb que aument en forma extraordinaria en toda la zona desde 1999 asegura
1193467 esto podr a explicar la gran incidencia de partos prematuros y abortos espont neos
1193468 confirm que el roundup siempre es m s t xico que su ingrediente activo el glifosato
1193469 en todas las cuadras hay mujeres con pa uelos en la cabeza por la quimioterapia y ni os con barbijo por la leucemia
1193470 en todas las familias hay alg n enfermo de c ncer de todo tipo pero sobre todo de mamas est mago o garganta
1193471 el c ncer se ha convertido en una epidemia masiva en miles de localidades y el responsables es sin duda el modelo rural es una cat strofe sanitaria impulsada por las grandes corporaciones
1193472 es la ltima de una serie de grandes multas y decisiones judiciales contra monsanto incluyendo los 108 millones de d lares por responsabilidad en la muerte por leucemia de un empleado texano en 1986 una indemnizaci n de 648 mil d lares por no comunicar a la epa datos sanitarios requeridos en 1990 una multa de un mill n impuesta por el fiscal general del estado de massachusetts en 1991 por el vertido de 750 mil litros de agua residual cida y otra indemnizaci n de 39 millones en houston texas por depositar productos peligrosos en pozos sin aislamiento
1193473 es l der mundial en su especialidad y ha creado una verdadera revoluci n en la actividad agropecuaria de cientos de pa ses
1193474 cuando fumigaban nos encerr bamos en la pieza por d as nos dol a la cabeza picaba la garganta y ojos y si llov a el arroyo bajaba con peces muertos en el campo hay palomas perdices y liebres muertas nada deja el veneno
1193475 es mentira somos pobres pero la comida no les faltaba
1193476 los sojeros nos envenenan matan a nuestros hijos y resulta que la culpa es nuestra
1193477 los hallazgos fueron contundentes en cuanto a los efectos de los pesticidas y solventes
1193478 hijos o nietos de los trabajadores rurales y las poblaciones cercanas son los que dentro de d cadas pueden sufrir las consecuencias
1193479 existen relaciones causales de casos de c ncer y malformaciones infantiles entre los habitantes expuestos a factores de contaminaci n ambiental como los agroqu micos
1193480 sin olvidar la rotunda aparici n del glifosato y sus agregados
1193481 seg n cifras de la fao argentina ha aumentado en m s de un 200 por ciento el uso de agroqu micos principalmente en la pampa h meda debido a los herbicidas que se utilizan en la soja transg nicas
1193482 esto puede ser por haber sido estas zonas muy expuestas a los clorados y ahora son zonas expuestas al glifosato que sabemos produce irritaciones digestivas permanentes
1193483 en diferentes publicaciones se ha demostrado la existencia de casos de c ncer con pacientes que no hab an estado expuestos directamente a los agroqu micos pero si lo hab an sido sus padres o sus abuelos se produce cuando el qu mico impacta en la trama gen tica y se va reproduciendo de generaci n en generaci n o bien pasa a trav s del tero de la madre
1193484 en materia de salud p blica se est comprometiendo en forma directa a varias generaciones
1193485 determinar factores de vulnerabilidad en poblaciones expuestas a los plaguicidas
1193486 m s de la mitad de los encuestados y el 100 por ciento de los fumigadores refieren que ellos o conocidos estuvieron intoxicados alguna vez el 90 por ciento se ala que no existen personas resistentes a las intoxicaciones
1193487 en su inmensa mayor a no tienen contrato de trabajo ni cobertura m dica y cobran a destajo
1193488 son mencionados m s de 40 pesticidas predominando el uso de glifosato
1193489 las corporaciones como syngenta o cargill por citar s lo dos cuentan con poder econ mico y lobby pol tico suficiente para dificultar cualquier investigaci n que pudiera mostrar lo nefasto de este modelo agropecuario
1193490 las empresas como monsanto novartis y bayer impulsan la supresi n del disenso con una influencia que parece generar en los cient ficos una ceguera selectiva que los hace ignorar o malinterpretar la evidencia cient fica
1193491 se corren graves riesgos en fetos embarazadas ni os y ancianos
1193492 la direcci n de la epa prioriza la industria de la agricultura y los pesticidas antes que nuestra responsabilidad para proteger la salud de nuestros ciudadanos
1193493 el programa de pesticidas de la epa constituye un verdadero grupo de tareas del lobby pesticida
1193494 existe un complejo sistema destinado a impedir la publicaci n de hallazgos adversos gigantescas empresas imponen el tipo de ciencia e investigaci n cient fica que se debe hacer no es casualidad la ausencia de estudios toxicol gicos a largo plazo ni bioensayos en aguas y suelos
1193495 las corporaciones est n comprando departamentos enteros de universidades p blicas no s lo en la parte agron mica sino en la parte biol gica en la parte m dica los gerentes de las multinacionales compraron firmas de cient ficos y la literatura del complejo de la soja est infectada de papers rid culos
1193496 nunca me perdonaron que frenara las fumigaciones hab a ministros del gobierno involucrados me presionaron jueces para que diera marcha atr s y el juicio de mi destituci n fue un circo romano la vida se me est haciendo cada vez m s complicada me cuesta much simo trabajar en la profesi n los juzgados me hacen la vida imposible y debo presentar m s recursos que otros abogados por los disparates que resuelven en mis causas
1193497 la echaron por cumplir con su deber todos sus fallos se ajustaron a derechos y aqu eso es un pecado nadie se puede meter contra el poder pol tico y los empresarios sojeros
1193498 el herbicida conocido como agente naranja que fue usado por estados unidos para defoliar los ecosistemas de selva de vietnam durante los a os 60 era una mezcla de qu micos que proven a de varias fuentes pero el agente naranja de monsanto ten a concentraciones de dioxina muchas veces superiores al producido por dow chemical el otro gran productor del defoliante
1193499 cuando en 1984 se alcanz un acuerdo de indemnizaci n por valor de 180 millones de d lares entre siete compa as qu micas y los abogados de los veteranos de guerra el juez orden a monsanto pagar el 45 5 por ciento del total
1193500 un herbicida seguro y de uso general en cualquier lugar desde c spedes y huertos hasta grandes bosques
1193501 gran parte se debi al mayor precio del herbicida glifosato
1193502 we showed that ade and i have a few nice combinations together
1193503 that is really important for two strikers you always have to work together you always have to look for each other it is a good sign that he will be staying because it took him a while i am happy that he has committed his future to arsenal
1193504 last year we had a really good pre season and won almost every game and then after 50 seconds against fulham on the opening day we were behind so it is hard to say
1193505 hopefully we can get some confidence out of the first few games and can slowly build it up if you lose the first few games you are not at your maximum
1193506 there is a genuine belief now its not this plastic belief that was there before
1193507 you talk about winning because thats what youve got to do but you dont really feel it but the players believe now
1193508 thats whats changed its their psychology their belief theyve also improved physically and tactically and theyve got the experience some of these girls have been to two fifa events in two years and that counts for a lot
1193509 were a lot more confident than we were going into the 2007 world cup
1193510 that was about credibility but this time its about results and performance this is a new era and we have a new winning mentality
1193511 back in 2006 being a centre back in a new zealand team you knew your work was cut out for you
1193512 you knew that youd be defending for the whole 90 minutes
1193513 i was wondering whether it was a coincidence or a set up they told me that they were following the us team so thats wonderful
1193514 no one can replace abby on and off the field well miss her obviously but we have some great players who will be given a chance to come into the team theyve looked good in training and we have great confidence in them
1193515 the biggest thing that pia has brought to the team is passion
1193516 it was a tough way to end last year but she came in during december and said im going to change some things i hope you guys are excited about change
1193517 immediately you could see a fun and passionate side to her and this is reflected in the way we train and play she makes you want to play for her and for your team mates the way she celebrates goals in training is infectious
1193518 its going to be a good first game against norway
1193519 i think every team in this tournament is good and no one is going to have an easy game we know we have to come out strong but weve been training hard and were ready to play some good football
1193520 tough luck on you that feel you had your human rights violated tough luck
1193521 con el paso del tiempo se valoran a n m s sus m ritos en particular de haber llevado adelante y concluido el concilio vaticano ii
1193522 de giovanni battista montini para concluir el concilio que comenz en 1959 y se extendi hasta 1965
1193523 sin pablo vi la gran intuici n de juan xxii corr a el riesgo de no tomar forma fue un pont fice inolvidable
1193524 a medida que pasa el tiempo y la mirada hacia atr s se hace m s amplia y consciente aparece cada vez mayor casi sobrehumano el m rito de montini al presidir el concilio conducirlo felizmente a t rmino y gobernar la agitada fase postconciliar
1193525 el papa montini agreg ratzinger valoriz sus destacadas dotes de inteligencia y su amor apasionado por la iglesia y el hombre
1193526 la divina providencia prosigui llam a montini de la c tedra de mil n a la de roma en el momento m s delicado del concilio c mo no agradecer al se or por su fecunda y valiente acci n pastoral mientras damos gracias a dios por el don de este gran papa nos comprometemos a hacer tesoro de sus ense anzas
1193527 no se dej condicionar por incomprensiones y cr ticas si bien debi soportar sufrimientos y ataques incluso algunos violentos
1193528 knowledgeable officials asserted that ivins had the skills and access to equipment needed to turn anthrax bacteria into an ultra fine powder that could be used as a lethal weapon court documents and tapes also reveal a therapists deep concern that ivins 62 was homicidal and obsessed with the notion of revenge
1193529 usamriid doesnt deal with powdered anthrax i dont think theres anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it you would need to have the opportunity the capability and the motivation and he didnt possess any of those
1193530 has actually attempted to murder several other people he is a revenge killer
1193531 still trying to process a lot of information its come in really quickly a lot of it is just consternation at the ridiculous motives theyre attributing
1193532 i was the division chief and i didnt know that anybody did that
1193533 all of the challenges that we did with animals were with wet spores the dry spores i wasnt aware of
1193534 changes really began to accelerate in the last year he would sit at his desk weeping he really couldnt do his work any more because the pressure was tremendous
1193535 i think he committed suicide when he was walked out of the building escorted by law enforcement officials
1193536 its possible that somebody could hide that violent side from all of your co workers and nobody would ever hear about it but i really really doubt it
1193537 none of what they do is going to stop us from delivering our message

1193572 pernah ada seorang raja di kota savatthi ini la memanggil seseorang dan berkata bawahanku yang baik pergilah dan kumpulkan pada satu tempat semua orang di kota savatthi yang terlahir buta baiklah jawab orang itu dan ia melakukan apa yang diperintahkan oleh rajanya dan ketika ia telah berbuat seperti itu raja berkata kepadanya sekarang wahai bawahanku yang baik tunjukkanlah kepada orang orang buta ini seekor gajah baiklah jawab orang itu dan ia melakukan apa yang diperintahkan oleh rajanya la menunjukkan kepala gajah kepada salah seorang buta yang lainnya telinga yang lain lagi gading yang lainnya lagi belalai kaki punggung bulu ekomya dan bulunya sambil berkata kepada mereka masing masing oh orang buta ini adalah seekor gajah sesudah melakukan hal ini orang itu menghadap raja dan berkata baginda gajah telah ditunjukkan kepada para orang buta lakukanlah apa yang paduka kehendaki maka raja mendatangi orang orang buta itu dan berkata kepada mereka masing masing oh orang buta sudahkah engkau melihat gajah ya baginda kami telah melihatnya jawab mereka kalau begitu beritahukanlah kepadaku seperti apakah seekor gajah itu lalu salah seorang buta yang telah ditunjukkan dengan kepala gajah berkata seekor gajah adalah seperti sebuah kendi sedangkan yang telah ditunjukkan dengan telinga berkata seekor gajah adalah seperti sebuah tampah mereka berkata bahwa gading adalah seperti sebuah mata bajak belalai adalah seperti sebatang tiang bajak tubuh adalah seperti lumbung kaki adalah seperti sebatang pilar punggung adalah seperti lesung ekor adalah seperti sebuah alu dan bulu ekor adalah seperti seikat sapu lalu mereka mulai berdebat berteriak seperti ini ya bukan seekor gajah bukan seperti itu ya seperti itu segera saja mereka mulai berkelahi satu sama lain dan raja merasa senang dengan apa yang dilihatnya demikian pula pengembara dari ajaran lain adalah juga buta mereka tidak dapat melihat mereka tidak dapat mengetahui yang bermanfaat atau tidak mereka tidak tahu apakah itu dhamma atau bukan dan karena ketidaktahuannya mereka dengan sendirinya suka berdebat bertengkar bersikeras masing masing mempertahankan pendiriannya bahwa memang demikian

1193590 we have told the defence ministry that arms purchases are potentially dangerous and therefore it should inform us of each and every one of its transactions
1193591 recent history shows that the greater the secrecy and the more limited the transparency in arms purchasing the more likely there is to be corruption involved
1193592 renewing the operational capability of the armed forces to guarantee our defence is very important and for that very reason there must be transparency at each step of the acquisition process
1193593 we have informed the defence ministry that classified purchases of war material are exceptions to the rule and must be justified according to stringent conditions we have also indicated the rules that must be complied with prior to declaring an acquisition to be a secret of state
1193594 paradoxically when i was defence minister as a retired army general military procurement was transparent while now that the defence minister is a civilian arms acquisitions are secret

1193604 they never gave her any of the proper medications for her aids diagnosis they did give her a prescription for a urinary tract infection but even then they filled her prescription with the wrong strength and they never diagnosed the meningitis even though she had been complaining about headaches sweats and generalized pain for weeks that is what killed her in the end
1193605 it was so advanced that it involved her brain her liver her lungs her heart and a couple of other organs she died in terrible pain

1193628 thus said hashem whoever remains in this city will die by the sword by the famine or by the pestilence whereas whoever goes out in surrender to the chaldeans will live he will have his life as a booty and he will live
1193629 thus said hashem this city will surely be delivered into the hand of the army of the king of babylonia and he will capture it
1193630 let this man be put to death now because he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who remain in this city and the hands of all the people by speaking to them such things for this man does not seek the welfare of this people but rather their detriment

1193673 in january 2007 when general david petraeus took command in iraq he called the situation
1193674 progress has been due primarily to an increase in the number of troops and a change in their strategy
1193675 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there
1193676 iraq has met all but three of 18 original benchmarks set by congress last year to measure security political and economic progress
1193677 the success of the surge has not changed senator obamas determination to pull out all of our combat troops
1193678 to make this point he mangles the evidence he makes it sound as if prime minister maliki has endorsed the obama timetable when all he has said is that he would like a plan for the eventual withdrawal of u s troops at some unspecified point in the future
1193679 senator obama is also misleading on the iraqi militarys readiness
1193680 but i have also said that any draw downs must be based on a realistic assessment of conditions on the ground not on an artificial timetable crafted for domestic political reasons this is the crux of my disagreement with senator obama
1193681 senator obama has said that he would consult our commanders on the ground and iraqi leaders but he did no such thing before releasing his
1193682 the danger is that extremists supported by al qaeda and iran could stage a comeback as they have in the past when weve had too few troops in iraq

1193716 in the defining moments of this glorious nation our character our resolve and our collective soul has been tested
1193717 everything we enjoy today security prosperity and the ability to enjoy freedom was bought at the price of service and sacrifice of the men and women in the united states military
1193718 were all familiar with the phrase freedom isnt free i think its important to add another phrase which is not everybody pays the same price the soldiers here today are paying an additional price an additional burden so that our country can remain free
1193719 this task force is a shining example of americas armys ability to bring national guard soldiers together from multiple states to provide complex aviation operations in combat
1193720 this is a country that wraps our arms around those who serve and sacrifice for us we are deeply grateful every day for your service to our country as citizen soldiers

1193753 merczateers have an irrational attachment to their melee weapons and will often use them instead of guns when possible
1193754 writing on the wall psalms laments and prayers of rising generation
1193755 lead primarily born again believers to a place where they can pray from a strong platform of faith and to a place where they can then communicate those same principles to others
1193756 reinvent in my life what it means to be in love with you i realize how satisfying you are and how nothing will ever satisfy me like you
1193757 and i cant wait till ive learned it by heart and can sing it at the top of my lungs
1193758 you have to lead up lead sideways and lead down you lead in all directions
1193759 how do you keep going what keeps you from giving up
1193760 what keeps me going is peoples lives transformed by the grace and love of god and then reformed and re directed a sure and quiet knowing that i am called by god and the chance to see that call direct other women
1193761 everyone of us has had an encounter an epiphany where we knew we are called
1193762 i live to see that in women around me and when i do i know they are
1193763 she is clothed with strength and dignity she can laugh at the days to come she speaks with wisdom and faithful instruction is on her tongue
1193764 lazarus is dead and for your sake i am glad i was not there so that you may believe
1193765 if god wants you to trust him he puts you in a place of difficulty
1193766 would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country
1193767 he said we couldnt afford to say no to anyone
1193768 if i had better foresight maybe i could have improved things a little bit
1193769 but frankly if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job in the first place
1193770 the top people should be booted out and replaced by executives who have the confidence of the markets
1193771 this company has to answer to shareholders to our regulator and to congress and those groups often demand completely contradictory things
1193772 sure its hard to deal with the pressures of congress and shareholders and regulators
1193773 but thats why executives get paid so much its not acceptable to blame those pressures for making bad choices
1193774 there is little to nothing that freddie mac could have done to prevent the losses that it is now incurring
1193775 the message from our community is so often one of despair
1193776 while we dont want to relax our concern its just great to discover that these animals are doing well
1193777 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group
1193778 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1193779 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1193780 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1193781 if he is working for the team i might go see him when im done here
1193782 the vehicle went off the edge of the road and flipped several times
1193783 he says hell be ok and is looking forward to a full recovery
1193784 im hoping the fact that i might puke right now is actually going to have the reverse effect and that ill suddenly be steady and calm by being in a helicopter
1193785 sorry we couldnt get some explosions going off in the background
1193786 they wanted me to sign a tenacious d dvd just because i had a cameo in the movie
1193787 i spilled something on my dress i didnt want it to stain so i stuck my dress under the sink and was running out the door
1193788 im holding penny and every magazine prints that penny peed on me it wasnt penny
1193789 i bring her with me everywhere its nice to have another heartbeat shes a little piece of home
1193790 blake is a young actor but very thorough i can see why shes on the rise
1193791 blake was such a big advocate of the sisterhood she loved bridget when she feels something is right she follows her heart no matter what shes fearless and down to earth
1193792 goes across the world i was moving from los angeles to new york literally at the same time i was shooting this movie
1193793 i was moving away and starting out on my own and i have these girls people i work with people on the show that are really close
1193794 i never read those stories the only thing that made any of us nervous was the fact that we had a six week prep
1193795 it happened so fast we were nervous because we didnt have a script at the beginning we were all so happy to be together we loved the first movie so much we wanted to do a sequel there was never any hesitation about that
1193796 yeah i dont really like to talk about anything but the show
1193797 its two separate things you dont date a character im nothing like serena
1193798 evidence of secret detention by the united states and whose fate and whereabouts remain unknown
1193799 there is no case that immediately comes to mind that this fits but that doesnt mean there isnt one
1193800 we have been pushing for a compromise between legislative leaders and we will continue to push for a budget deal that includes budget reform
1193801 we all along have said everything should be on the table
1193802 we need to take action now on climate change what we need to see is massive investment in renewables
1193803 burning coal is putting massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere and we need to reducre our emissions not increase them
1193804 this demonstration is a wake up call because this government is sleepwalking into catastrophe
1193805 gordon brown is a politician who said climate change is one of the biggest threats we face then he gives the go ahead to a massive expansion of aviation and coal fired power stations
1193806 we showed that ade and i have a few nice combinations together
1193807 that is really important for two strikers you always have to work together you always have to look for each other
1193808 it is a good sign that he will be staying because it took him a while i am happy that he has committed his future to arsenal
1193809 last year we had a really good pre season and won almost every game and then after 50 seconds against fulham on the opening day we were behind so it is hard to say
1193810 hopefully we can get some confidence out of the first few games and can slowly build it up if you lose the first few games you are not at your maximum
1193811 i think any of the top four can win the title i am not going to say we are going to win it because you never know they do not know we do not know either
1193812 arsenal have to win something every year that is our aim if it is not happening then everyone is really disappointing
1193813 even as we fight the epidemic globally we must focus at home and i intend to do so with my foundation
1193814 i have been extremely disappointed with the clinton foundation especially with it headquartered in harlem of all places that it has been silent on this issue
1193815 im very grateful and it is appropriate that president clinton is committed to taking this on
1193816 the vehicle went off the edge of the road and flipped several times
1193817 this new method for estimating the number of new hiv cases provides us with an important tool for better understanding and tracking the number of people infected with hiv
1193818 our state continues to be heavily impacted by the hiv aids epidemic
1193819 through december 2006 new york reported 176 008 cumulative aids cases more than any other state approximately 80 percent of new cases are among people of color
1193820 our policy for the last two years is to offer an hiv test to everyone who is sexually active
1193821 there is an older population with hiv people are living 20 years longer with this disease
1193822 is designed to cater for anger killing but it is not significantly well tailored for killings that are a response to fear
1193823 for men and women who kill their partners these changes will mean that the letter of the law finally catches up with judges and juries who in recent years have been less prone than people think to let men off lightly and punish women harshly
1193824 harman which treats men as either second class citizens or a menace to society
1193825 liberalism is in essence the hiv virus and it weakens the defense cells of a nation
1193826 we need to execute people like john walker lindh in order to physically intimidate liberals by making them realize that they can be killed too otherwise they will turn out to be outright traitors
1193827 we do detest you we despise you and we hold you in complete and utter contempt the day will come the day will come when unpleasant things are going to happen to a bunch of stupid liberals its going to be amusing to watch very amusing to watch
1193828 if guns are outlawed how can we shoot the liberals
1193829 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him
1193830 my goodness honey i had no idea women worked so hard
1193831 economists estimate that it will only be five or ten cents starting ten years from now
1193832 theres too much confusion i cant get no relief businessmen they drink my wine plowmen dig my earth none of them along the line know what any of it is worth
1193833 there are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke but you and i weve been through that and this is not our fate so let us not talk falsely now the hour is getting late
1193834 cest ainsi que le ministre tha landais des finances raconte la m saventure qui lui est arriv e bord de sa bmw et la forc a sextraire de lhabitacle au m pris de toute tiquette par une fen tre blind e bris e grand peine par son entourage

1193836 my life had become this rhythmic migration from bubble to bubble
1193837 who was william shakespeare and why do we still study his works
1193838 i read othello yesterday and really enjoyed the online experience i also love the cost effectiveness of reading online since shakespeare books are not inexpensive or always available
1193839 i always keep in my mind everything comes full circle
1193840 the good thing about it is it did i dont feel anything different its just like i was going on a vacation for a little bit
1193841 i just remember how it all went down it was a shock
1193842 just a sour moment at that point and then the next thing you know i was on a plane headed to miami trying to adjust down there
1193843 it was tough at first but you just have to roll with it
1193844 it wasnt a good situation down there because all my four years down there it was like a coaching carousel
1193845 it was like coaches in and out from head coaches to offensive coordinators its hard to get adjusted or acclimated to anything like that when you dont have stability or anything
1193846 its pretty much the same old marty in our book
1193847 hes a little wiser now that hes been in the league nine years a smooth route runner and his hands are what separates him from others theyre huge
1193848 you shouldnt have a guy who goes out there and has to play 70 plays a game
1193849 that should be split keep guys fresh keep guys ready
1193850 right now were just out there practicing trying to get a feel for one another and get a little chemistry going in this offense so we can be pretty good this year
1193851 im quite sure once thursday rolls around and then as we get on later into preseason games and the regular season ill figure out what that role is
1193852 i tried just about everything then the last thing we tried seemed to work well it turned around in about three or four days
1193853 he should have a nice fresh arm between now and the end of the year
1193854 hopefully we can get it done the next couple of days every thing is fine
1193855 ive missed time before but its frustrating when its something as small as this you miss some games and not part of the action in a pennant race its no fun to just be watching
1193856 for aircraft slower than 150 knots start your turn about a half mile early
1193857 im sad about the conversation you chose to publish regarding myself and alon her son who volunteered a comment when i was videotaping his mom about t d
1193858 out of all the conversations we had i would have written more along the positive impact t d is having on the black community the spiritual community there are a lot of things i think i could have focused on versus the ears
1193859 do you think that when you write something along those lines that could have an impact on for example my sons interaction with his uncle
1193860 some people get to a point in their lives when they think they are so high and mighty you should genuflect to them i dont think this is tony dungy i think this is his family its just ears
1193861 please dont try and tear a class act like garnett down
1193862 i just wanted to thank you for the july 27 remembrance of bob rainey it was a lovely tribute i loved the story that you told it was so him
1193863 c j i called you years ago to say that i liked 70 percent of your stuff and i was annoyed by 30 percent i may sound like im fawning but the piece you wrote on mr rainey over the weekend was beautiful
1193864 as i sit here reading your column in my lovely white t e d anti embolism socks i have empathy for his purpleness see we both belong to a special club those with hip replacements im on the recovery trail after have the second leg done and one of the recommendations given to me was to wear these most unfashionable socks while flying as they will help to prevent blood from pooling in the lower leg and the possibility of throwing a clot or two blood clots can be fatal as you know and i would guess the option of looking good or death is not a hard choice kathie teslaw apple valley

1193878 it is a great opportunity for fashion brands to get involved in something quite big and heroic
1193879 more and more we are seeing fashion brands getting involved in sports like the olympics or wimbledon or the u s open
1193880 all young people want to these clothes because they are beautiful and very fashionable even some older people like to wear them
1193881 with the olympics everyone wants to look sporty as this is the biggest event ever for us and we all want to be supportive
1193882 i support the candidacy of insert name here with great vigor
1193883 he was a friend to everybody everybody who knew maurice had a friend immediately

1193889 the cost of medications is extremely high and now were adding fuel costs that are going up so whats going to happen
1193890 ultimately our goal is to make new york energy independent to get us off this fossil fuel all together
1193891 sock it away and your nest egg will be ready when youre due to retire
1193892 it was definitely an inconvenience you had to either walk to your vehicle and whatever you bought that day you had to somehow get it back to your house
1193893 the fhwa granted the funding to build a new bridge there and so a bridge replacement project will be overseen by the town
1193894 i dont think ours is as large as the one in minnesota so we probably dont have as much to fear as those poor people did
1193895 we can and should increase our domestic production of oil and natural gas but we should start by telling the oil companies to drill on the 68 million acres they currently have access to but havent touched and if they dont use it they should lose it
1193896 he continues to oppose the use of nuclear power these misguided policies would result in higher energy costs to american families and businesses and increase dependence on foreign oil were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires

1193902 make detailed and comprehensive arrangements for the stability and security of the transport system
1193903 last season was remarkable and it is the same for this season
1193904 it is just so tight with good drivers in both teams ferrari and mclaren
1193905 right now they are all in with a shout which is very good for the sport because you dont want it to become predictable and you dont want number one drivers in a team
1193906 but at this stage you just cannot call where the title is going to go it could be any one of four
1193907 i wouldnt even discount heikki even though he knows he has pace to find on lewis
1193908 but he will be boosted by winning a grand prix so the ingredients are there with all four looking more like seasoned drivers which is helping
1193909 if you had asked me before the race though who i would put money on i would have said lewis but i have to say i would want my bet back
1193910 id be saying wait a moment that ferrari looks strong so as an outside bet id put my money on raikkonen
1193911 it is so much more competitive than when i was driving in my championship year with williams
1193912 you really do have a much more difficult task to win three grands prix on the trot than you did back then
1193913 he made a great start it was a great move it was a senna esque overtaking manoeuvre
1193914 but then he had such bad luck and it can be quite difficult to pick yourself up from that
1193915 there is a huge gulf from something that is there on paper and what is real
1193916 to get within three laps having a commanding lead and then to have the engine blow like that after having driven such a great race is quite cruel
1193917 we have the speed in the race but if i cant get qualifying right we are going to end up at every race in the situation ive faced in the last two races
1193918 we need to sort it out and get back to the front so we can fight for the wins otherwise we are just following people and when you do that you cant use the speed
1193919 the car seems to be working well we just need to find a good set up again to fix a few problems and then we can be back in the hunt for wins
1193920 its been a bit difficult for me in the last few races but we are still in the championship
1193921 despite my problems finishing third yesterday and scoring more points than the guys in front of me in the championship was not too bad a result i will take it any way i can get it
1193922 we will see how we can sort things out for the next race and see if we can be stronger and fight for the victory
1193923 there are still many races to go were there in the championship so im not too worried about things
1193924 it comes down to it being too painful financially for that segment of our community it did not make sense to put that kind of disproportionate burden on folks that desperately need mass transit in this town
1193925 a lot of mothers ride the bus especially in the latino community to go and pick children from school and take them to school this will be a big burden for them because they have an average more than one child
1193926 for now the points are just a wow character score as we graduate to that blizzard account system which is right on the horizon it will switch over to a blizzard level
1193927 recent published reports about the potential links between mitochondrial disorders and autism demonstrate the urgent need for more research into mitochondrial disease a devastating and often fatal illness
1193928 mitochondrial dysfunction has also been implicated in alzheimers dementia parkinsons disease huntingtons disease heart disease and diabetes
1193929 mitochondrial disease is not rare researchers estimate that every 15 minutes a child is born with mitochondrial disease or will be diagnosed with mitochondrial disease by the age of 10 most affected children do not live beyond their teenage years

1193950 the first lesson i try to impose on my son and i think hes learning is no wastage
1193951 i told him that once he starts playing around with the shampoo the soap and the water hes being wasteful those are very valuable resources and its hard to return them to the state where they may be useful again
1193952 every time there was a party in his preschool i found myself segregating all the trash that his classmates would leave behind i thought he was learning things which i dont allow at home
1193953 after about 20 years of pushing myself how to live in an environmentally friendly way its becoming harder and harder because each and every single decision has an impact on the environment now
1193954 i try to make very careful purchases shopping for food takes hours because you have to keep considering whether or not what youre buying is healthy and environment friendly
1193955 i am glad i found a soul mate who is just as concerned about the environment and who doesnt complain when i insist on using biodegradable soap no pesticides or toxic chemicals in the house or a slow food diet in fact a good deal of the decisions i make about stepping lightly on the earth are arrived at together with him
1193956 i say it nicely like i have asthma can you please do it outside but my son he really screams though its true smoking really kills every pack of cigarette is shortened life probably a drain in the entire health care system which has also an environmental impact like breast feeding

1193959 i shifted from bs to ab psychology then i went to law school at the university of the philippines
1193960 but i would still be an advocate of the environment or social justice had i gone into a different profession
1193961 i handled the environmental administrative aspect specifically concerning the trees that were removed in the area to give way to the buildings construction
1193962 the paper details our work in taal lake and the framework we are using to gather the stakeholders toward a workable management plan
1193963 it certainly seems that the current controls and preventive programmes dont appear to be working
1193964 it also seems that some sectors that were not considered to be noisy workplaces are in fact more harmful than thought the world is becoming a noisier and noisier place
1193965 although excessive exposure to loud noise over a period of time is known to be the cause why this is occurring in large numbers in certain industry sectors isnt clear as permanent loss usually takes some time to develop

1194128 i am concerned about ageing odour and know there are anti ageing odour products but have not bought them myself
1194129 japan is becoming more of a cleanliness and odourless society and the name kareishu fits right in with that trend of the times
1194130 more japanese men are becoming concerned about their smell and so the need for anti body odour products is growing
1194131 this petrol scheme will enable our volunteers to keep the cars on the road the cars that enable them to do the very important job of helping families in need
1194132 it has been an increasingly worrying issue over recent times as petrol prices have skyrocketed we have had a lot of anecdotal information coming in from our local services saying that volunteers were having to make a decision about whether they could continue to volunteer

1194143 its become common even though its illegal for traders to sell stock short without first locating shares for the transaction this gives power players such as hedge funds virtual free reign to bring down a companys share price
1194144 the regulators frankly are very naive about what really goes on
1194145 perhaps we ought to reevaluate it in the greatest bear market in 25 years
1194146 emergency action by regulators to rein in abusive short selling in some large financial firms should be expanded to include the stocks of all public companies said a former top markets watchdog former securities and exchange chairman harvey pitt
1194147 they only borrow on paper actually they have probably been selling shares they dont even have for months
1194148 in a naked short sale the investor sells stock that has not yet been borrowed
1194149 sellers sometimes deliberately fail to deliver securities as part of a scheme to manipulate the stock price
1194150 the emergency rule would require any person making a short sale in the listed securities to borrow the securities before the short sale is effected and deliver the securities on the settlement date
1194151 todays global economy is technology driven as a result innovations within the engineering and science sectors are of principal importance engineers will continue to play a prominent role in this process the real question is where these engineers will be located we have shown that when evaluated on a level playing field the united states is producing a competitive number and quality of engineers computer scientists and information technology specialists

1194158 unless we have from the north koreans a verification protocol that is robust then august 11th will come and go and there will be no change in the situation
1194159 it is up to the north koreans now to come back to us and accept a verification protocol
1194160 i think the fed is going to stand on the sidelines holding at 2 0 percent were getting a very mixed economic picture right now
1194161 i think the housing market is really the central element of this crisis
1194162 yes consumer price increases are so high that the inflation hawks will be screeching like crazy at tomorrows fomc meeting expect some strong language about inflation in the statement but no action
1194163 fears of insolvency have not as yet been fully set aside
1194164 there may be numbers of banks and other financial institutions that at the edge of defaulting will end up being bailed out by governments
1194165 i heard the plane above and thought gosh its awfully low and awfully early
1194166 i made a decision not to politicize the games this is for athletics
1194167 theres plenty of time for politics and im confident ill have time for politics
1194168 ive told the president i make no promises except ill push as hard as i possibly can to get it done before i leave the presidency
1194169 we are hopeful that we will be able to reach an understanding with the north koreans but were not at that juncture yet
1194170 weve been able to put our finger on the social pulse of human connectivity on a planetary scale and weve confirmed that its indeed a small world
1194171 over the next few decades new kinds of computing applications from smart networks to automated translation systems will help make the world even smaller with closer social connections and deeper understanding among people
1194172 messenger data gives us a unique opportunity to study distances in the social network
1194173 to our knowledge this is the first time a planetary scale social network has been available to validate the well known 6 degrees of separation finding
1194174 we used a population sample that is more than two million times larger than the group studied earlier and confirmed the classic finding
1194175 deceptively smart he was down to earth and folksy in his prime which was until recently there was no better trial lawyer than bob montgomery
1194176 it is do with national pride it does become the first gold medal of the games
1194177 for every games there is that sense that we are presenting the nation to the world and that really has been probably since 1980 when the games started to become a big television deal
1194178 any kind of demonstration or political religious or racial propaganda in any olympic sites venues or other areas
1194179 the purpose of hosting the olympics is to prove to the chinese people that the rest of the world acknowledges the chinese communist party as legitimate leaders
1194180 that is why to see some of the world leaders including president george w bush and french president nicolas sarkozy showing up they are allowing themselves to be i feel props in the chinese communist party spectacle
1194181 i do have the authority to impose a sentence higher or lower
1194182 i guess jerry yang didnt come out of the meeting as unscathed as it seemed
1194183 we were surprised at the very high vote counts that were pro jerry yang
1194184 certainly the final results seemed very different from the exit polls
1194185 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1194186 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1194187 capital research global investors asked broadridge financial to double check the votes it transmitted to yahoo on its behalf
1194188 i think jerry yang is still firmly in place until some deviation happens from the plan yahoo has set forth
1194189 used improperly ricin can be a very dangerous and deadly weapon
1194190 fortunately in this case the ricin is not believed to have caused any harm to the public

1194192 it makes me extremely happy to be here this is the pride of the chinese people

1194212 muito preocupante para a federa o internacional de t nis e deve ser tamb m para o comit ol mpico internacional quando jogadores que n o atendem aos crit rios de qualifica o aprovados pelo coi tomam o lugar de outros que foram qualificados e que mereceriam representar seus pa ses nos jogos ol mpicos de 2008
1194213 im really excited to be able to be a part of this adventure
1194214 its great to be able to go on location and do something new and different with our sixth annual calendar
1194215 its very exciting to be in vegas and shooting our calendar
1194216 its a new opportunity and great to be part of it i was a cowboy cheerleader for three years and we would go to a tropical island to shoot that calendar and this is very different
1194217 you have a lot of eyes on you and you have to tune them out and focus in on what the photographer is telling you to do
1194218 puedes ir a un rest de 1 estrella o sin estrella y el trabajo sera igual de duro y aprendizaje quizas mayor
1194219 puedes hacer pasantias en 3 estrellas por 6 meses y llenarte la boca con eso pero no sabes si los 6 meses era pelando papas y limpiando camarones
1194220 even though the veterans have been colts cheerleaders its so different when you go somewhere else the entire experience of the bus drive lockerroom staying in a hotel its a lot of fun
1194221 theyre doing a pregame show at the hall of fame game
1194222 so theyve been working on that choreography and getting that cleaned up
1194223 weve already got the new experience of the new stadium so with this game everything new is double
1194224 our rookies have been working hard to get everything memorized with the lockerrooms and tunnels for lucas oil stadium but everything with this game everything will be different
1194225 what do you want to see colors players life defining moments milestones let your canvas unfold into images that make your heart sing if you dont like what you see how can you begin making small changes to make certain pieces of your life more prominently displayed and to lessen any parts that are overshadowing
1194226 we wouldnt recommend any of them because we havent seen evidence that any of them deliver what they say but if mr smith down the road said he bolted one to his car and felt he got some benefit were not going to challenge that
1194227 what concerned us in recent times was the increase in cost for some of these devices there are some where its upwards of around 5000 for a conversion that starts to highlight to us there is maybe a requirement to say look just be warned the price is getting quite high without any real proof of them being able to deliver
1194228 colin maxwell parsons was born in birmingham england and worked as an engineer with the british army where he was called to serve with the infantry in egypt cyprus and northern ireland prior to devoting all of his efforts into art thereafter he lived in the channel islands for several years where he was the driving force behind the establishment of the guernsey guild of creative art he later moved to california for a time where his landscape paintings became very collectible parsons now divides his time between england and the united states but still travels extensively for inspiration exhibitions and promotions parsons work beckons us to take in the beauty and grandeur of the european countryside as we let our imagination wander through lush landscapes that lie beneath skies infused with light filled color we hope to join the genteel society of a bygone era that resides there parsons takes our daydreams of nature at their most serene and captures them with exquisite detail onto canvas today parsons is considered to be one of the finest contemporary landscape artists in europe he has had one man exhibitions in the united states australia and the channel islands
1194229 the yankees put an enormous amount of pressure on this kid and hes only 21
1194230 as long as cashman is holding the cards he will not at this time trade phil hughes for anyone
1194231 they do a lot of things for us and protect our families and to be able to give back to them is pretty amazing
1194232 its a process its going to continue to be and you just have to be patient with it just throw strikes and try to get better every time you go out
1194233 you know murcer said rizzuto everytime we talk about golf the yankees score murcer replied well then golf golf golf
1194234 you are never going to believe who just walked in the bar
1194235 bobby murcer was the heart and sole of a yankees team years ago there are many 40 something men out there that are truly sharing in this pain
1194236 they could not would not keep up their early pace
1194237 mark my words they will go into their slump some time in august
1194238 i shaved it as soon as i came out of the game
1194239 we were losing when they hit that grand slam and then we came back and won
1194240 in about a week it will be back it goes hand and hand with winning
1194241 i would have kept it if we were winning that game
1194242 i dont know the whole answer yet but it didnt seem like it would be anything serious
1194243 theyre always a winning team and theyre always in the playoffs
1194244 youre talking about a hall of fame catcher we were able to acquire
1194245 its a big transition but we thought he could do it
1194246 it happens in baseball you have to be ready for anything
1194247 he stops the running game he brings a winning attitude
1194248 hes been catching a long time he brings a lot of knowledge
1194249 i am satisfied that bat was in breach of the contract with the farmers when it failed to buy their tobacco which it was obliged to under the contract as well as under the tobacco control and marketing regulations
1194250 bat is liable to pay the farmers for the value of the tobacco delivered to its marketing sheds it is appropriate to take the price provided by the defendant which puts the average price at sh1 200 per kilo
1194251 bat made us to suffer when it abandoned us with the tobacco which it contracted us to grow and we had nowhere else to sell it
1194252 bill and i want to highlight the enormity of this problem and catalyse a global movement of governments and civil society to stop the tobacco epidemic
1194253 its time to stop swimming against the tide of what people want
1194254 the expectation among rights holders is that in order to create a success story you must reduce the rate of piracy weve found that is not the case
1194255 their pr and marketing firms are spreading disease and death in the way that no virus has been able to do yet
1194256 yet in africa donor money goes to dealing with infectious diseases hiv tuberculosis and malaria instead
1194257 the global tobacco epidemic is worse today than it was 50 years ago and it will be even worse if another 50 years unless an extraordinary effort is made now
1194258 its the only legal product that when used according to manufacturers instruction kills or causes heart diseases in more than half of the people who use it
1194259 the tobacco industry continues to market a product that has no benefits and causes only death and disease
1194260 who wants cancer but we were sadly wrong the tobacco companies went on to sell record volumes
1194261 i took my kids aged six and eight to ellis park for the first time for the lions versus sharks super 14 game
1194262 for the past four years weve visited absa stadium in durban where smoking is banned inside the stadium and there are designated smoking areas
1194263 but when we arrived at ellis park s fnb family stand we found ourselves surrounded by a great number of smoking spectators
1194264 ellis park is clearly out of touch with the rest of the developed world on this score there are numerous signs telling people how to conduct themselves in the family stand but no ban on smoking
1194265 i just think its ludicrous to remind people about the use of appropriate language and other issues but allow smoking
1194266 if you drill my teamates im going to drill you
1194267 i am not an almajiri my mother is alive and i live with her
1194268 without struggling to earn a living i may end up spending the day with empty stomach so if there is no game holding i become a porter
1194269 you know today is the final match of the polo tournament and no sooner had the match started than i sold a few packs people so much like benson and what only remains now is aspen and super king
1194270 i dont have my capital we normally collect the packs from a retailer in our area and he doesnt give more than five packs per child
1194271 however owners or managers of prohibited smoking areas such as hotels and bars will be allowed to set aside designated smoking zones within their premises
1194272 it is a pity that 13 per cent of primary school pupils are smokers
1194273 during the period the kenya revenue authority received sh4 7 billion as tax from cigarette manufacturers while kenyans spent sh18 billion in the treatment of tobacco related illnesses in various private mission and public health facilities
1194274 ninety four per cent of the respondents said they supported strong and visible warning messages about the harmful health effects caused by tobacco products and advertisements while 91 per cent said they are concerned about tobacco use by young people in the country
1194275 for every smoker who dies another life of a passive smoker was also lost
1194276 this is because there are over 4 000 harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke
1194277 if that was the case that is disappointing its certainly not what we would wish to happen
1194278 there were a series of shops that had been painted a yellow the same colour as one of our brands there
1194279 we had a look at it recently it wasnt against the law but it didnt look right so we have been back in there and weve been making sure those are repainted
1194280 when i announced this initiative i said that i hoped others would step forward
1194281 im delighted bill and melinda gates are supporting one of the most important public health efforts of our time our commitments will help governments confront the tobacco epidemic by implementing the proven mpower package this means assuring well staffed tobacco control programs raising tobacco taxes running hard hitting public information campaigns creating comprehensive smoke free public places and banning tobacco advertising
1194282 tobacco caused diseases have emerged as one of the greatest health challenges facing developing countries
1194283 the good news is we know what it takes to save millions of lives and where efforts exist they are working we are pleased to join with mayor bloomberg who has made the fight against tobacco a priority in new york city and around the world
1194284 bill and i want to highlight the enormity of this problem and catalyze a global movement of governments and civil society to stop the tobacco epidemic
1194285 we challenge governments to show leadership by implementing tobacco control measures as an increasing number are doing and to increase funding for these efforts
1194286 the country spends five times the revenue it gets from growing tobacco treating patients of the malaise making it totally impossible to make a case of any advantage we are getting from the whole industry
1194287 annually the public health system treats some 12 000 patients from tobacco illnesses out of which 4 000 are non smokers thus the need to tighten rules to protect no smokers
1194288 what farmers in these areas should be encouraged to do is grow more food than tobacco to help kenya attain self sufficiency in food production it is sad that the nearly arid lands are put under crops that dont help food security for the family
1194289 the soils take years to recover and support other crops thus accelerating food insecurity which translates in high poverty levels
1194290 i was appointed to establish the competition and have thoroughly enjoyed this initial phase of developing a strong platform for growth and success on both sides of the tasman
1194291 the growth opportunities are endless and i look forward to watching the anz championship develop into a premier female international sports competition and popular spectator sport
1194292 the whole regions transport network must establish a dense atmosphere of secure transport and production
1194293 make detailed and comprehensive arrangements for the stability and security of the transport system

1194315 the high number of new zealanders being harmed by pharmaceuticals each year shows an urgent need for measures such as electronic prescribing mandatory reporting of adverse events and much more careful medicines management
1194316 if 24 000 new zealanders experienced an adverse reaction to dietary supplements it would be considered a national scandal

1194322 i think thats been going on for quite some time
1194323 i think we just have to acknowledge and accept that desperate times call for desperate measures and the reality is that were going to see all sorts of people playing all sorts of games and doing different things
1194324 at the end of the day it doesnt excuse us were on the record twenty four seven weve just got to accept that this is going to be a pretty robust election campaign
1194325 there is always the possibility of what we say to anybody maybe picked up spun around and end up on the front page of a newspaper
1194326 so the key thing is to be saying in private what you do in public i think that is where mr english has been caught out
1194327 we will not allow terrorism to stand in our way
1194328 afghanistan will stand with our friends in india in fighting the menace of terrorism

1194331 while weve been through this flat period as a number of other developed countries have particularly those with high levels of investment in the property sector things are looking better for the latter part of this year
1194332 in a softening economy people will be very hesitant about price increases and other things so thats given us enough room to cut interest rates
1194333 we have said that we have room to cut actually were in a better position than most oecd countries because weve done what we think is the right thing and we increased during good times
1194334 you cant buy security but you can make yourself feel more confident and secure confident secure women have healthy financial lives and happy relationships and if by some freak of bad fortune they dont have these things they have mad money accounts to help them get back on track

1194337 i respect that theyre here and spent a lot on their homes but on the other hand give me a little bit too ive been here since i was 7 years old
1194338 sanzars current position is that it is a very much a three country expansion of super rugby with south africa involved
1194339 the trans tasman idea does not include south africa and that is absolutely not the nzrus preferred position at the moment
1194340 at this stage sanzar are unified in new zealand australia and south african teams being involved in super rugby and tri nations going forward
1194341 sanzar needs to remain very very strong particularly in todays rugby environment which is very trying
1194342 this one has been mooted before we have been over some of these ideas over the last few weeks
1194343 there is nothing dead in the water at the moment because reviews are taking place over the next 12 months and we are happy for all options to be included happy for any suggestions to come forward from any people whether it is players sponsors provincial unions or franchises

1194349 confirmation of the presence of perchlorate and supporting data is important prior to scientific peer review and subsequent public announcements
1194350 this is surprising since an earlier tega measurement of surface materials was consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate
1194351 we are committed to following a rigorous scientific process while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1194352 initial meca analyses suggested earth like soil further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry

1194395 rather than disposing of the body it was prepared to be eaten
1194396 one of the arguments is really if you want to punish your enemy killing them is not enough if you can chop them up and eat them and turn them into excrement that is the greatest humiliation you can impose on them
1194397 the amount of evidence is so overwhelming it would be unfair to pretend it didnt happen it is too important to ignore
1194398 it was definitely there its recorded in all sorts of ways in our histories and traditions a lot of place names refer to it
1194399 you will get your english based historians who come out of an english culture who dont understand it and avoid it because they dont understand it

1194422 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1194423 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1194424 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1194425 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1194426 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1194427 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1194428 they need to be firmly on the health agendas in the african continent if we dont do something now we will have an epidemic in 2030 that we can prevent today
1194429 in a part of the world where infectious disease naturally attracts an enormous amount of attention the story of cancer remains untold the hopeful side of the cancer story has never been more positive however without increased awareness of the issues we will never be able to fully address the challenges presented we are excited by the interest that this group of pan african journalists has shown at todays event and look forward to ongoing input from all parties
1194430 the round table discussion on myths surrounding cancer yielded impactful results the most compelling of which was the fact that the media themselves recognize that there is a need for more information to be provided on an ongoing basis to help resolve these disconnects
1194431 the issue of tobacco and cancer also revealed that there is a very low level of understanding of the link between tobacco and cancer and that the man on the street still does not understand that tobacco use causes cancer considering that the world health organization has released statistics which show that by 2010 cancer will be the leading cause of death in the world it is imperative that we as a group provide the necessary education to help debunk these myths
1194432 when i was diagnosed with cancer i thought it was a death sentence i soon learned that there are many myths that surround this disease and cancer is still not talked about openly but through all the support i received it became clear that my life was not over and that one can survive cancer

1194435 clinicians need to embark on a baseline epidemiological research to know the magnitude of the problem and thereafter update it on a regular basis but the few clinicians are overburdened with clinical work load and there seem not to be adequate funding for research
1194436 the lack of adequate tools and personnel in africa generally has been our bane in terms of research for data it is therefore welcome news that a tool as simple as assist has been developed very user friendly and reasonably sensitive and specific to catch the intended population
1194437 the world health report of 2001 estimated that one in three adults or 1 2 billion people then were smoking and estimate was that by 2025 more than 1 6 million would be smoking and 8 4 million would die from tobacco and its effects
1194438 the present initiative is therefore worthy of praise since it marks the start of a combined work among various institutions for a serious courageous and successful combat against smoking in the country without disrespect to the rights and freedom of citizens aiming at the protection of public health of angolan citizens
1194439 dont go looking for your own answers outside the evidence you hear in this court

1194457 ito sabay hawak sa suot niyang necklace yung symbolism nung kasi ng santorini ito yung buong island nila the whole island is made up of lava so this is part of santorini
1194458 hindi yung bracelet is made up of may mga symbols

1194490 this time bomb has already exploded and the situation could get worse
1194491 today it is a cab driver but tomorrow it could be a video game shop owner
1194492 i am collecting the history of our people as written into things their hands made and used
1194493 to think how different the world will be one year from this date
1194494 i can see myself supporting an energy policy that includes offshore drilling
1194495 my position has been clear from the beginning and has not changed
1194496 this is the kind of bold leadership we expect from a president
1194497 i work to run the day to day operations of the campaign and im involved in the strategy talking to sen mccain help directing the activities here at the campaign headquarters and out across the nation to help deliver the senators message
1194498 why do you think youve lasted so long what is it about you
1194499 i dont know i just i keep showing up you know nobody tells me to leave so at seven oclock in the morning im here and trying to do what i can to help the campaign
1194500 is it a problem to not have a single person who is in charge of the entire operation
1194501 you know if you dial it back a couple of weeks i was doing all of it
1194502 i went to mccain and said look i need help
1194503 this is an area that we call our war room
1194504 the morning shift starts at 6 they go till mid afternoon and then we switch over weve got a night crew that comes in
1194505 do you think you need to have your taxes raised im not your candidate sen obama is
1194506 youre an african american man and supporting john mccain obviously do your friends give you a hard time at all
1194507 most of my friends like john mccain in any other election year they would probably be right here working with us
1194508 you see that board over there the jet is where the senator is
1194509 today he landed in michigan were going to do a quick otr stop a quick off record stop at a little hot dog place
1194510 i think we need to take the transcript of what he said at the top and take a look at that and incorporate what he said as examples
1194511 i think so i also liked the idea of as much as we can getting the real people examples
1194512 i met a guy who owns two trucks and he said he could stay in business if he didnt have to pay 25 cents a gallon tax extra on diesel fuel
1194513 well we havent had a meeting about it yet and i dont want to be presumptuous
1194514 but you know i think any good acceptance speech gives you a real good sense of the guy who is asking to be president of the united states
1194515 at this point can you write in his voice pretty well
1194516 its very hard to get his voice out of my head after 20 years
1194517 we dont make it a litmus test for employment at the mccain campaign
1194518 it goes without saying that some people who are involved in the lobbying profession do it because theyre interested in that side of the equation theyre interested in government theyre interested in congress theyre interested in public service
1194519 how do you distinguish someone who you know lobbies on behalf of cancer from one someone who lobbies on behalf of an oil interest i wouldnt call them the same thing but theyre still lobbyists
1194520 nobody ever saw the inside of a campaign and it used to be a bunch of old guys like me sitting around with cigars you know dreaming up things to do and now its like were on all the time
1194521 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
1194522 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
1194523 if we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrels heart beat and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence
1194524 people often say that this or that person has not yet found himself but the self is not something one finds it is something one creates

1194526 a bird does not sing because he has an answer he sings because he has a song

1194529 when it comes to reducing the price of oil u s senate candidate jeanne shaheen simply has no idea what she is talking about the last few weeks have perfectly illustrated this fact
1194530 on july 23 shaheen released her five point plan to lower gas prices
1194531 her second point is close the london dubai loophole she claims that speculators have used markets in london and dubai to bid up the price of oil
1194532 so the first two of shaheens five points would have no impact on oil prices because they seek to fix problems that do not exist
1194533 point no 3 demand that refiners increase their production of oil but lowered refinery output is not a cause of high gas prices it is an effect of high oil prices
1194534 shaheen has embraced a sixth point force oil companies to drill on land they already lease
1194535 in summary not a single point in jeanne shaheens energy plan would lower oil prices or significantly increase domestic production and one would probably increase gasoline prices
1194536 meanwhile she continues to oppose the best and quickest way to lower oil prices open the outer continental shelf to drilling
1194537 if you think about it it really is incredible that on the most pressing issue of the day jeanne shaheen has no solution she should go back to the drawing board and try again shes still got a few months until the election maybe shell come up with something
1194538 je ne comprends pas ce que la municipalit appelle lieux publics car m me les voies publiques constituent des lieux publics et on ne peut pas interdire quelquun de fumer dans la rue
1194539 mrs hohaia got up came across and intercepted me she said i wondered when you would come youre just trying to show them they can walk here
1194540 its a little bit less pressure on the right pedal that may make the difference between arriving just a bit later or not arriving at all
1194541 they saw him mr cowdrey three times bobbing up and down in the river
1194542 they did have contact with him yelling out screaming to him to get to the other side of the river
1194543 all of a sudden he just went down and he never came back up
1194544 we all look after each other thats a big thing in our team
1194545 six of the boys were walking into town when three of them decided to get a run on three others including mr cowdrey were left behind and walking at their own pace
1194546 he was looking down at the river saying something to the boys and they told him to get down in a split second he fell
1194547 whether he was feeling the effects of that who knows bit exhausted bit of concussion there was some heavy knocks
1194548 with the limited resources they police have we dont expect every man and his dog to be down here but if it was anyone elses friend im sure theyd sympathise with us wed like to see people walking along the banks and a boat on the river if possible just searching the site
1194549 we never give up hope but he hasnt been found well look every day
1194550 the condition of the river is a factor and with the amount of water it may affect how soon he is found
1194551 at a time when he should have been focusing on his own rehabilitation on release from prison
1194552 its the sophistication of prosecution cases that drives up our time and costs
1194553 out of that 355 000 i would have paid out about 70 000 for other lawyers alone
1194554 if theres an increased crime rate governments cant complain that theres an increased cost in dealing with it the legal aid bill is in direct relationship with the number of people being arrested
1194555 lawyers dont ask police to charge people if we get our social policies right then crime will come down
1194556 i work day and night shifts one after the other after the other
1194557 come with plenty of questions and be prepared to be amazed
1194558 for beginners and professionals alike theres something to learn something to talk about and lots and lots to see
1194559 when youre famous you kind of run into human nature in a raw kind of way
1194560 it stirs up envy fame does people you run into feel that well who is she who does she think she is marilyn monroe they feel fame gives them some kind of privilege to walk up to you and say anything to you you know of any kind of nature and it wont hurt your feelings like its happening to your clothing i dont understand why people arent a little more generous with each other i dont like to say this but im afraid there is a lot of envy in this business
1194561 we are all born sexual creatures thank god but its a pity so many people despise and crush this natural gift

1194582 diriwayatkan dari aun bin abdillah ia berkata aku berkata kepada umar bin abdil aziz bahwa aku telah meriwayatkan hadits dari seorang sahabat nabi saw yang kemudian diketahuinya oleh umar
1194583 sesungguhnya rasa malu iffah menjauhi yang syubhat dan diamnya lisan bukanlah diamnya hati serta pemahaman agama
1194584 iman terdiri dari enam puluh cabang lebih dan rasa malu sebagian cabang dari rasulullah saw melewati seorang anshor yang sedang menasehati saudaranya bahkan lebih dari itu dalam hadits lain dinyatakan
1194585 setiap agama memiliki akhlak dan akhlak islam adalah rasa malu
1194586 sesungguhnya allah adalah maha malu yang suka menutupi aib yang mencintai rasa malu jika salah seorang dari kamu mandi hendaklah ia mandi di 4 rasa malu adalah benteng akhir keislaman seseorang
1194587 sesungguhnya allah azza wajalla apabila hendak menghancurkan seorang hamba menarik darinya rasa malu apabila rasa malu telah dicopot maka tidaklah kau jimpai dia kecuali dlam keadaan tercela dan dibenci bila sudah tercela dan dibenci maka akan dicopot darinya sifat amanah
1194588 tidaklah ada suatu kekejian pada sesuatu perbuatan kecuali akan menjadinya tercela dan tidaklah ada suatu rasa malu pada sesuatu perbuatan kecuali akan menghiasinya
1194589 bukan sekedar itu akan tetapi barangsiapa yang mealu dari allah dengan sesungguhnya hendaknya menjaga kepalanya dan apa yang ada di dalamnya hendaknya ia menjaga peruta dan aapa yang didalamnya hendaknya ia mengingat mati dan hari kehancuran

1194592 twenty four hours after the assassination chief curry assured reporters that the sound of the shots told him at once they had come from the texas school depository and that right away he radioed an order to surround and search the building but actually as we see from the police departments official version of events chief currys immediate concern was not the depository but the triple tiered overpass towards which the presidential car was moving at about eight miles an hour when the fatal shots were fired

1194624 our long term goal should be to alter our lifestyle accordingly beginning in infancy or early childhood
1194625 instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy 7 months is perfectly safe without adverse effects
1194626 our review of the literature convinces us that more aggressive and earlier intervention will probably prevent considerably more than 30 percent of coronary heart disease
1194627 studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30 why not nip things in the bud
1194628 a concerted national effort might dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality due to three major chronic diseases it would take generations to achieve and it would require an all out commitment of money and manpower to re educate and modify the behavior of a nation is that impossible no we have already shown that even a frankly addictive behavior like cigarette smoking can be overcome eventually

1194638 from the point of view of the government department the department of justice it saves us some time and money as well because were not dealing with more than 100 foi application a year mr brumby told 3aw

1194655 what were seeing here is a clear pattern of repeated violations of patient medical records and patient confidentiality by ucla
1194656 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues
1194657 ucla should have detected the violations by ms jackson years ago and should have immediately initiated the process to dismiss her
1194658 all other employees who were found to have violated patient confidentiality during our review have been disciplined including some who have been terminated
1194659 on behalf of the entire leadership of the ucla health system i am deeply sorry for this failure and the personal distress these breaches may have caused
1194660 californians have every right to expect their medical records to be safeguarded and protected and i am alarmed about repeated violations of patient confidentiality and the potential harm to the citizens of this state
1194661 by putting financial penalties in place for those employees and facilities that do not follow these laws this legislation will lead to better care for all californians

1194682 i did quite a bit of data on particulate matter and pollutants and the pulmonary function test conducted on several canadian athletes in beijing
1194683 that checks a persons ability to expand air and transfer oxygen to the lungs
1194684 i think the pollution woes have been a little bit overdone by the media
1194685 but were sending the message loud and clear that its important not to get distracted from the real environmental factor likely to detract from performance the heat and humidity
1194686 some of us have already used the ice vests that kind of help precool you a little bit before the race to fend off the heat for the first bit
1194687 athletes are also working with cool drinks and strategies throwing cold water on ourselves and anything basically to try and keep the body temperature down its going to be pretty extreme heat
1194688 it could be the kind of thing where it finishes somewhat like a triathlon guys just coming in minutes apart from each other and 30 finishers

1194696 perbuatan seperti itu seakan menjadikan tugu berkenaan berhala yang dihormati sekiranya pun pelakunya tidak mempunyai sebarang iktikad bahawa itu semua memberi manfaat dan mudarat maka perbuatan itu adalah sia sia dan bodoh ia tetap haram kerana meniru perbuatan musyrikin
1194697 jika pelaku beriktikad itu memberikan kemanfaatan kepada keamanan kedamaian ruh mereka yang telah meninggal dunia maka itu adalah perbuatan syirik yang jelas akidah islam menentang sebarang unsur keberhalaan
1194698 pemimpin atau sesiapa sahaja yang terlibat dalam perbuatan ini hendaklah bertaubat kepada allah dan kembali kepada akidah islam yang sebenar

1194709 tidak ada kebijakan dari dpd untuk tidak mencalonkan anggota dprd penerima dana bansos red itu pernyataan pak agung laksono
1194710 saya rasa kalau statusnya saksi bisa bisa aja apalagi yang banyak berbuat untuk masyarakat terkecuali yang sudah berkekuatan hukum tetap ya tidak boleh
1194711 sampai hari ini pak setia budi tersangka korupsi bansos red belum terlihat tanda tanda mencalonkan lagi beliau pernah bilang tak akan mencalonkan di kukar maupun di tingkat satu dprd kaltim
1194712 saya rasa kekhawatiran kearah itu tidak ada kami tidak takut ada yang sampai pindah partai yakin bahwa kader golkar yang ada sekarang ini loyal terhadap partainya kalaupun tidak dicalonkan sekalipun mereka masih solid di golkar
1194713 sekarang ini banyak anggota dewan yang reses mulai hari ini kemarin red sampai tanggal 10 agustus 2008 memang ada yang datang tapi hanya beberapa orang saja
1194714 kalau gara gara menerima uang itu bansos red diasumsikan sebagai pelanggaran hukum kemudian tidak bisa mencalonkan bagi saya tidak apa apa saya mau berkebun aja
1194715 kalau saya tahu itu duit bansos ya ndak saya terima blangko yang saya tanda tangani bunyinya uang sumbangan transportasi ya kita terima
1194716 karena waktu itu pemerintah pusat terkesan belum rela melepaskan otonomi seluas luasnya kepada daerah

1194766 firstly what is in question is whether a debtor creditor relationship actually existed if it did then it is not unreasonable to assume that the member knew or ought to have known and should have disclosed a debt and the name of any other person who may have discharged it
1194767 secondly if a debtor creditor relationship did not exist was a gift received and was the name or the donor known or reasonably discernible or was a donation made that covered expenses in an election campaign

1194814 level itu akan naik seiring penggunaan shikijaku itu sendiri kalau semua level sudah tercapai baru telur itu akan menetas

1195097 we need everybody in this party to get behind this effort to turn out thousands and thousands of volunteers in every single state in the country to hit the streets and go register millions of new people that weekend alone
1195098 its not about whether or not we will get barack obama elected it is about whether or not we will have a progressive majority in this country for decades to come
1195099 but do they have the infrastructure to reach a million disenfranchised voters who would not register otherwise
1195100 the message from our community is so often one of despair
1195101 while we dont want to relax our concern its just great to discover that these animals are doing well

1195120 sonny has joined us for one season with the option of another season
1195121 has confirmed his complete desire to finish with rugby league to switch over to union
1195122 hell be at the very least in the stadium or better on the team sheet
1195123 our problem is is williams under contract with another rugby union side the answer is no
1195124 therefore hes free to join with whoever he wants he doesnt need a letter to leave
1195125 very serene very determined to make his entry into rugby union
1195126 that seems to be a closed chapter in his career
1195127 in my view williams should finish his season with his club in australia and then come to france
1195128 i find it funny and bizarre that a player would break his contract in the middle of the season to go somewhere else
1195129 there is a rule in the french competition that a player can finish his season in australia and then come to france midway through the season
1195130 at a basic level we dont believe anybody should break their contract
1195131 dont tell them to shoo you could possibly get people like that to re think their beliefs even if its just one you could make a difference why do you dismiss them and tell them to go away
1195132 because i dont want people like that on my blog i dont think theyre capable of re thinking
1195133 dont say that you could make a difference instead you rant and offend them
1195134 thats because i dont have one girls dont have weiners girls have privates
1195135 nuh uh girls have weiners you just dont see them girls have weiners on the inside they have weiners inside of them

1195138 he and larry kelly were polar opposites from what i understand but they worked together to generate so much excitement there were things going on here from the beginning that were the envy of the opera world
1195139 i have been thwarted in my efforts to give dallas the best opera possible
1195140 he was an inspiration to everyone he was not an easy man sometimes because he was so lost in the music
1195141 the things he loved most in the world were food music and gossip he had an unending source of stories some of them quite bawdy and he loved to invite people over and cook pasta

1195213 i truly felt abandoned it makes me question whether i want to trust twitter with a journal of my thoughts and communication anymore not to mention the ability to hijack my 1 500 followers i have no way to export them so how can we keep connected should this happen again
1195214 for the record i had no communication from twitter that i was reinstated no explanation amp especially no apology leaves me a little cold
1195215 twitter is 16 employees made up of systems engineers and operators product designers and support specialists we do not employ public relations professionals

1195218 sometimes its hard to take criticism but being able to be anonymous on the web logs helps students to write what is really on their mind its gives them a freedom that doesnt always exist in the classroom being anonymous allows those students being critiqued to accept feedback without becoming defensive they dont know who is giving the feedback and assume that they are also unknown

1195220 it was pretty cramped down there the whole terminal was down there
1195221 the wind picked up and in probably five seconds it blew my friend into her husband
1195222 he grabbed her and pulled her inside and we all ran down the stairs it was like dead still and then within five seconds 10 seconds we were all blown away
1195223 they actively tried to cover it up and mislead us

1195226 i heard the plane above and thought gosh its awfully low and awfully early
1195227 he walked out and thats the last time i saw my boy
1195228 he seemed calm but looked like he was anxious to leave
1195229 but when girls were down there he would just stare at them from the bridge
1195230 sometimes hed say stuff like i wish i could get a girlfriend
1195231 one of the things i liked was there was a lot of energy and we knew how to finish drills better than we did in the spring
1195232 one of the things that was definitely a plus was defense and the retention being where it was supposed to be chasing the ball
1195233 it was very evident that their body demeanor was good
1195234 obviously you have to get back use to the practice thing everyone was very hyper and came out here and the anxiety hit us pretty quick we got pretty tired pretty fast we managed to work through it and overall we had a good day
1195235 all of us have been out here all summer working hard just for days like this
1195236 i dont feel like we lost any ground we got out there and did what we trained to do all summer
1195237 you say your in shape but you have to get back in practice shape because practice moves fast
1195238 you know you have been running and everything but once you get back in practice shape you will be good
1195239 this is the first day to our season right here
1195240 we worked on the basics to prepare for this day
1195241 we worked out a few of the kinks but everything felt pretty good
1195242 provide entrepreneurs with a user friendly way to build a website
1195243 we understand that there are improvements to be made and thats what makes the process more enjoyable
1195244 you have something to strive for i think these olympics will be special because of the hype the anticipation other countries have to see if we can dethrone argentina but they 2004 holdovers say this team is much more cohesive more united
1195245 we learned that you cant just pick an all star team get together for a few weeks and be good enough to win
1195246 as the gap with the rest of the world closed you couldnt do that anymore when i took the job i insisted on certain things including the power to put it together the way i thought best
1195247 in the past there were too many people involved in making the decisions and as saw it wasnt very successful weve changed that culture and im very proud of that
1195248 that wasnt going to happen again that was a one time thing the highlight of my career you cant repeat that you just move on
1195249 but we arent entitled to anything anymore i was part of the movement that brought the pros in even before the breakup of russia and yugoslavia because you could see things changing you couldnt keep sending boys out there to play the pros
1195250 the game has evolved to the point internationally with our players going there and their players coming here that you cant get together for a few weeks and walk away with the gold medal no one is in awe of us anymore
1195251 we werent rooting for each other we were fighting against each other because everybody wanted to play i loved all the guys on the team but it just wasnt the right combination for an olympic team now i look at the team and weve got the right mix its going to be 12 guys who are going to get this done
1195252 you just think about your own kids and where they are and how quickly it can all be over
1195253 its such a shame to see someone so young die like that its a huge waste of life
1195254 i guess when it happens near where you live or near the people you love it feels more real
1195255 when you hear about it somewhere else its sad but when it happens near you its scary

1195266 a government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away
1195267 on two occasions i have been asked pray mr babbage if you put into the machine wrong figures will the right answers come out i am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question
1195268 they will try to say he doesnt look like the rest of the presidents on the dollar bill
1195269 the truth is obama played the race card and got caught and was slammed hard this time the reason why the obamabots cannot accept it is that they premissed their support on obama entirely on this stupid racist charge against the clintons they know that if it was really based on merit no one would have voted for obama with any intellectual honesty but if they can call the clintons racist they have an excuse to their intellectual dishonesty mccain was able to illuminate the issue with so much more effectiveness because he couldnt be muzzled and the msm media knew that if they dont play fair mccain would have fox all to himself anyway and he could now paint the msm as biased without fear of contradiction the clintons relied on an unbiased media unfortunately they failed to do their jobs and surprisingly it was fox surprise surprise who was much more objective with them however fox does not carry much weight among democrats so the racist charge stuck
1195270 nobody thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what they are going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all of those other presidents on the dollar bills
1195271 nobody thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what they are going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all of those other presidents on the dollar bills
1195272 so is the mccain ad about race or about presumptiveness because all of these things could be interpreted as the presumptiveness of our dearly beloved soon to be crowned democratic nominee its obama that attracts huge adoring crowds obama that has his plane tricked out in presidential logos he isnt saying anything though i need a plan i need him to connect with me hillary succeeded in that she was so well versed in every major issue and obama just isnt clear enough for me i am very wary of the presumptive attitude his lack of record and his lack of message he is not connecting with me even though im trying my best to follow hillarys lead
1195273 a cross section of voters are alarmed at the tenor of some of these statements
1195274 theres a groundswell of reaction to these comments and not just these latest comments but really a pattern or a series of comments that weve heard for several months
1195275 folks are beginning to wonder is this really an isolated situation or is there something bigger behind all of this
1195276 its obama that attracts huge adoring crowds obama that has his plane tricked out in presidential logos he isnt saying anything though i need a plan i need him to connect with me hillary succeeded in that she was so well versed in every major issue and obama just isnt clear enough for me i am very wary of the presumptive attitude his lack of record and his lack of message he is not connecting with me even though im trying my best to follow hillarys lead
1195277 bo and bo supporters welcome to hillarys world now you know what it feels like to have done to you what the bo campaign and media did unto senator hillary clinton during the primary
1195278 ive been concerned about some of those comments and that there might be a backlash
1195279 i dont think its accurate to say that my comments have nothing to do with race
1195280 heres what i was saying and i think this should be undisputed that i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama i am african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate what that means is that im sort of unfamiliar and people are still trying to get a fix on who i am where i come from what my values are and so forth in a way that might not be true if i seemed more familiar
1195281 a lot of obama supporters used that as an excuse without that i dont see any intellectually honest reason to support obama over clinton not when his positions now are copied from clinton not when clinton has a better grasp of every issue imaginable its not even comparable the only thing superlative about obama in comparison with clinton is his oratorical skills which is now getting tired so obama supporters now need to find a reason not to have any buyers remorse looking back to the primaries theyll all see the msms unanimous and biased view that the clintons were racists and feel glad but now that mccain has shown the race baiting for what it is the obama supporters are in a tail spin so they do the only thing that would relieve the cognitive dissonance that their vote for obama is causing in them claim that mccain has to be racist or claim that obama did not race bait despite all evidence to the contrary good luck with that one thing you can say about hillary supporters our conscience is clear
1195282 i thought you didnt like the term sweetie yet you have no problem using it to put down
1195283 the examples you give of sexist indignities hillary suffered were not in ads run by obama and
1195284 and i want any one here with any intellectual honesty to tell me that bill clinton said anything remotely racial only stupid race baiters will see any racial component to what he said this is a sore spot for me because race baiting is such an ugly thing it cuts off any conversation and discussion in a flash you become a vile creature through no fault of your own but the wild accusations of someone im glad that mccain nip it in the bud race baiting is disgusting and im glad he slammed obama the way he did
1195285 jf the argument that obama has been more specific than mccain is not good enough for me i
1195286 i want obama to get his ass kicked in novembers election do you get that mark and let me tell you he deserves it so does axlerod and plouffe
1195287 how much do you exercise your race baiting muscles every day seriously thats not racist its inane perhaps but its not racist
1195288 irrelevant because the war is there and any would be president has to contend with it irrelevant because he himself admitted that he could have voted that way irrelevant because he wasnt even in a position to vote at that time
1195289 we can now confirm that the lady injured in the collision on brompton road was pronounced dead at the scene
1195290 she was the only occupant of a silver car heading from patrick brompton towards scotton which collided with a bin wagon travelling in the opposite direction the driver of the bin wagon was taken to the friarage hospital in northallerton
1195291 we attended a road traffic collision between a car and a bin wagon we were sent to attend to a 65 year old female who had gone into cardiac arrest but unfortunately she died at the scene
1195292 we have increased our donation because we realise the current economic climate is causing difficulties for a growing number of people
1195293 50 things i take for granted everyday but for which i am truly grateful
1195294 three things cannot long be hidden the sun the moon amp the truth buddha
1195295 youve now reached the age where life beings to take more than it gives
1195296 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

1195329 oscar winning actor morgan freeman was hospitalized in serious condition monday after the car he was driving left a rural road in the mississippi delta and flipped several times
1195330 has a broken arm broken elbow and minor shoulder damage but is in good spirits
1195331 suffering is the single greatest challenge to the christian faith
1195332 i can tell you that we have a criminal investigation underway
1195333 the nature of the investigation is involving police records and how they were released by another department
1195334 the criminal investigation means that were conducting an investigation with the purpose of trying to determine whether or not any crimes were committed associated with the type of nature and investigation
1195335 the city of bakersfield i t department is responsible for ensuring the integrity of all city computer systems
1195336 i dont know the full scope of the number of individuals involved
1195337 its a variety of administrative and investigative information that the police department held
1195338 if all of it isnt removed during the surgery how long do i have
1195339 doctor please if it all isnt removed how long do i have
1195340 depending on how slow or fast it spreads you could live for years a lifetime even
1195341 or it could be a matter of months if we dont get it all well have you in here as soon as you heal for chemotherapy and theyre making huge strides in treatment options everyday
1195342 dont tell anyone not my mother not my stepfather nobody
1195343 mr dreylncourt if i may youre young youre healthy whether or not we remove it all i do believe that you will live a long life
1195344 well you know what they say only the good die young
1195345 i dont care dont let anyone keep them in their house thats creepy tell them to dump me in the ocean or spread me around als kitchen
1195346 no of course not my mother would faint just tell them to dump me someplace pretty
1195347 please dont throw me from the roof im out of practice flying and i dont want to have to learn on the fly if youll forgive the pun
1195348 you know ive always wondered what the eye of a hurricane felt like this must be it
1195349 hes there closer than when im reaching i think but the second i reach its like he withdraws
1195350 ive felt him for almost my entire life nobody could fake him like that
1195351 all right now the biggie does it bother you that hes still there
1195352 no i thought it did but that was when i thought he was always slipping away from me now that i know hes there its like a relief i mean how many people get something like that
1195353 i had someone that truly loved me he accepted me more completely than i even accepted myself and now hes gone but i get to keep him like my own secret or a guardian angel if that type of thing existed
1195354 dont worry about it its one of the nifty little snippets of knowledge ive picked up from your species after all these years
1195355 you had the potential otherwise trevor couldnt have given them to you
1195356 my father used to say that blood calls to blood he said that everyone that shared the same blood was connected and so he widened that connection between trevor and i
1195357 they werent they were soul mates he told me the bond is almost as strong and sometimes stronger than the blood bond
1195358 it doesnt happen often even when people find their soul mates
1195359 i think you ought to figure that out before you go forking over your heart to someone
1195360 we were just discussing what movie we wanted to watch tonight before bed and i conned him over to my side
1195361 to be honest if it grows at all the surgery would become entirely necessary and then it would be so dangerous that in all likelihood he would never walk again
1195362 i have to smudge the odds a little its part of my job
1195363 theres no guarantees its right against your spine you know how dangerous that can be
1195364 have them make the appointment if thats my best bet
1195365 but we do have to lose a little of these clothes
1195366 isnt allowed to join but is more than welcome to watch now relax
1195367 i have to enjoy you while i can in a week i wont be able to do anything to you for at least six more
1195368 i didnt hear anything besides you locked it youre just nervous
1195369 shh if someone came in wouldnt they call for you
1195370 well then there we go now i believe we were right about here
1195371 i just need a place to stay for the night
1195372 of course stay here im going to go and get you some ice to try and keep that bruising down
1195373 i have to go to the bathroom ill be right back
1195374 no no thats not it im just surprised thats all
1195375 she was just in her underwear and marc locked the door they want another baby so greg can have a brother or sister of his own but but marc he cant have anymore kids so they wanted
1195376 they wanted me to have sex with her so she could get pregnant but i couldnt i couldnt do anything she was kissing me and touching me and they pulled my clothes off even though i told them i didnt want to they said i owed them for letting me stay with them
1195377 i couldnt even get hard and they got so angry and they started yelling and then marc just flipped ive never seen him like that i thought he was going to kill me
1195378 its all right cam look you cant go back there im going to call off work and then were going to the police station and youre going to tell them everything you just told me
1195379 only cause i couldnt do what he wanted me to they did so much for me i should have been able to repay them
1195380 you dont have to repay them theyre supposed to be doing that because they care about you not just so they can get another legitimate kid out of it
1195381 cam i do i really do youre grateful and youre embarrassed and you think you owe these people something but you dont theyre supposed to be acting as your parents not using you as a stud to have more kids youre just confused but you have to realize that what they did last night is not right nothing gives them the right to try and use you like that or beat the hell out of you like that all right they are in the wrong you didnt do anything wrong
1195382 shut up let go of me you dont know anything i should have been able to they needed me
1195383 whats wrong with me oh my god why i dont understand
1195384 there is nothing wrong with you just because you didnt want to do it with her doesnt mean anything you were put on the spot you couldnt do it because you were afraid and you knew it was wrong
1195385 cam its going to be all right let me go and call my job then well go together i wont leave your side i promise
1195386 i cant i cant what about greg what would happen to him and me where would i go i cant go back to jumping from house to house i cant
1195387 shh listen to me take a deep breath well worry about all that later what i am most concerned about is getting you out of there and someplace safe and greg too we dont want them trying to do this to greg too all right we cant let them do this to anyone else right
1195388 there are no tour dates for the band at the moment so please dont buy tickets for u2 shows you see advertised
1195389 the world is a very different place than youve been led to believe right and wrong good and evil black and white they dont exist its all just one big smorgasborg of half truths riddles and shades of gray heaven laughable hell about the same when you die youre dead when youre alive youre dead when youre dying its just another go around the block thats the shit of it you know everyone keeps believing if theyre good something good will happen down the line for them and maybe it does but that doesnt have anything to do with whether or not they did anything good but even if they do something they think is good for instance giving money to the homeless man on the corner guess what that homeless guy takes that money to the bus station gets a pass down to the suburb where he used to live kills his wife their two kids and just for shits and giggles their new puppy named oscar before holding a shoot out with the cops where he takes out a veteran and some poor neighbor kid before they shoot him good no youve done no good
1195390 futility you almost had it there for a while i thought you understood i mean watching your brother die like that that had to be a major blow and i really thought that would knock all that silly idealism out of you
1195391 of course thats probably danjals fault that boy always was trouble i should have ousted him a long time before i did but i thought he would come around
1195392 ah well not everyone can enjoy this type of thing
1195393 well yes and no he trusted burdock and had every right to the man didnt mean either of you any harm it was sickening really he took to you two as if you were his two dead sons come back to him he did die protecting you both but i couldnt just let all that trust he built up with the half wit go to waste and so i just borrowed his appearance it was a little hard acting as though i enjoyed the company of the two of you but well worth it to get my hands on you
1195394 oh now thats not necessary you wont be able to loosen those just a waste of energy really and youll want that energy for later or else you wont be able to scream nearly as much as will be required
1195395 now what did i just get done telling you there is no hell pay attention they told me you were smart
1195396 well theres nothing like physical motion to distract someone from watching energy build up
1195397 oh that was very good element of surprise the power the aim very clever but youve worn yourself out now havent you all of that energy that was the last of your reserves you really shouldnt waste energy like that unless youre certain it will take out your enemy
1195398 no human no but just because im in the guise of a man does not make me a man
1195399 now enough of these games i thought youd be looking forward to seeing your brother again lets not hold off the joyous reunion for any longer than necessary
1195400 now now you ought to hold still or i might just miss
1195401 see if you keep struggling this may just turn into a torture session
1195402 i needed you and you purposefully didnt come and you let me die
1195403 you kill me bring me back plant false memories in my head to make me hate my own boyfriend and now youre here telling me to calm down and trust you do you have any idea how stupid that sounds get out of my home get out
1195404 you could have had him all to yourself if youd have left me dead
1195405 i could have but he would have never forgiven me for letting you die he knew i was your guardian i thought that if i brought you back and made you despise him he would come running back to me for comfort the way he always did
1195406 i can prove it i can give you back every memory that you have lost every piece of your life that was stolen away when your soul went to uriel
1195407 get out of my home stay away from me stay away from xavier we dont want anything to do with you
1195408 you were so much more docile when you were alive you know
1195409 youre way too stressed collin a boy your age you should relax more
1195410 they need to stretch and breath every once in a while it stops hurting after a while too
1195411 hate is such a strong word and remember i told you you loved me once
1195412 how would you know you cant really remember if you did or didnt can you
1195413 i can show you i even know things about you that you never knew i can share everything with you if youll let me
1195414 xavier is mine and even if he wanted to he would never and could never raise a hand against me he is too smart he knows he would lose just like you lose but you havent figured that out yet so we can keep playing this game if you like or we can skip the game and we can sit down have a cup of coffee and talk as i said i have important information for you and xavier and i refuse to leave until ive shared it
1195415 go in the kitchen and wait i have to take care of the boys
1195416 those guards should be executed for doing this to her
1195417 i need you to get us a loaf of bread
1195418 yes you can devlin you have to start taking care of yourself now i know you can do it youre a strong boy you always have been
1195419 youre going to do great things with your life son i can tell your mother and i are very proud of you remember that
1195420 your mother is an angel now shes watching out for you shes very proud of you i know she thinks youre a very brave boy
1195421 not for a long time devlin but dont worry shell wait for you forever
1195422 now when you get there i want you to check in with mr zuick after youve finished moving into the dorms he says that he lives less than a mile from there so anytime you need a familiar face you can go there
1195423 he also said that if you wanted you could park your car in his garage so you dont have to pay for parking
1195424 mom i havent seen this guy in almost ten years theres no way im going to recognize him
1195425 mind your manners hes very kind to offer you his garage and his friendship in that strange city so you behave around him got it
1195426 everythings going to be just fine and ill call you as soon as i move in
1195427 ive been here a million years now you should be glad to be rid of me
1195428 bagged and tagged but i think the school supplies them anyway
1195429 whod have believed that i would raise the next ansel adams
1195430 hes jumped off of your house out of a moving car and dived off of a bridge what do you call that if not suicidal behavior
1195431 he did not jump out of the car he was never inside the car
1195432 for failure to get your son treated in a way that is in his best interest
1195433 it is as much our responsibility as it is yours to make sure these children are safe if a parents seems unfit it is our job to report them and get the child placed where he or she will be cared for properly
1195434 why dont we ask raven to come in and explain himself
1195435 none if you is going to talk to my son and if i find out you have been harassing him while hes at school i will call the heads of your organizations and have you all fired dont go anywhere near him
1195436 im not you know i just ive been having this dream and its really weirding me out and i thought maybe youd know what it meant
1195437 of course youre not insane ill do anything i can to help you out why dont you tell me about your dream well see if we can figure out its meaning
1195438 im not sure but from things that happen later on i think theyre somewhere in england or something back in medieval times
1195439 so me and this other guy are running through the woods and its really dark out and i cant even hear any animals were running from something but at this point in time im not sure what when the other guy thinks that were far enough ahead he stops running and lets go of my wrist which hes been tugging on since we left this castle thing that were running from i collapse onto my knees because im really exhausted and my whole body is in this immense amount of pain
1195440 when i looked down at myself i was in a dress and i was
1195441 i was a girl the dress was ripped and i was dirty and exhausted we started to hear a lot of men in the woods behind us and dogs they were yelling get them and dont let them get away and take the girl alive we need her
1195442 the guy i was with grabbed my arm again and started pulling me to my feet again but i pulled back because i was too spent to run anymore
1195443 the guy was dressed like a blacksmith or something from back then but he was wearing a sword on his hip his haird been tied back in a ponytail when we started running but now it was half loose and he was as dirty as i was hed snuck into the castle to get me free
1195444 he finally relented and said that he would he drew his sword and put it against my chest and then stabbed me right through the heart then he said as i have followed you in life i shall now follow you in death and he pulled the sword back out of me and stabbed himself right through the gut and collapsed on top of me and died too then i woke up
1195445 mr daniels are you possibly wrestling with your sexuality right now
1195446 calm down mr daniels i didnt mean to offend you its just a standard question were supposed to ask if you trade gender roles in your dreams
1195447 i know that sometimes its a subconscious urge that we can only express in our dreams
1195448 im not accusing you of being homosexual i just had to cover the basics so what do you think that this means
1195449 if i knew that i wouldnt be here talking to you i just want to get them to stop i really dont care that much what it means just so long as it stops theyre really disturbing and i cant get enough sleep and if i cant get enough sleep then im going to fail my classes and i am not here to waste my money
1195450 well i dont know for sure how to stop the dreams the best way to stop the dreams is to understand and come to terms with why youre having them however if you want to try and stop them without understanding them i recommend watching or reading something youd like to dream about for a good half hour before you go to bed then that will be in your mind right before you fall asleep and youll have a better chance of not having the dreams
1195451 if you have any more problems or want to talk about this any further you know how to reach me and here
1195452 this is my cell number and my e mail address should you need to get a hold of me when im not here

1195493 i didnt do my best i didnt even try to save the demon
1195494 i just killed it ive never seen so much blood and it was all because of me i did it
1195495 after what the demon did to your friend ricky we understand why you didnt try to save it we all would have done the same thing had it been one of our friends it was a terrible thing that happened out there but you cant go on forever pretending that it was all your fault youll drive yourself crazy that way
1195496 i would only come down and watch you all eat anne and things like that make several of our members very nervous
1195497 hes right about that anne thomas is home this week and you know how he gets about his eating habits especially when he thinks people are watching him
1195498 dont encourage him dylan he needs to eat otherwise hell pass out
1195499 im going to have greg make you a sandwich and send it up i want you to eat some of it not all of it just a bit so that we dont wake up to the sounds of your stomach growling tonight
1195500 i had better get down there and clear off the table before greg pitches a fit
1195501 if you need someone to come and talk to come and see me my door is always open okay
1195502 i dont want to name her anything anne you can name her
1195503 i killed something anne no not just something i killed a fallen angel without hesitation without remorse anne there was so much blood i kept trying to kill it after it was already dead
1195504 ricky this isnt healthy its not your fault that demon took something very precious to you and something just snapped that is not your fault things happen especially when youre under a large amount of stress and believe me that was a large amount of stress everything will be all right
1195505 dont you ever say anything like that again ricky never it was bad enough that you lost someone none of us would have been able to live with ourselves if we lost you too ricky you are loved by a lot more people than you think and you leaving us is not an option
1195506 oh gods sho it hurts he touched me touched my heart nearly froze it but it hurts so bad
1195507 all right hold on sky well fix it come on
1195508 get out of the way theres nothing to see here get lost
1195509 it was a ghost named tad he saw me on the street and knew that i saw him so he came over but when he saw me up close he started crying and i asked him what was wrong and thats when he grabbed my heart
1195510 sometimes its easier for ghosts to convey what they want to say through touching you rather than trying to explain it he probably didnt realize how sensitive i was to the other side for people who are not as sensitive that would have just made them cold but conveyed the emotion the ghost wanted to share but for me it didnt work like that
1195511 it was hurting badly and its my fault he recognized me and it made him hurt terribly but sho ive never seen this ghost before in my life ive never been to london before theres no way i could have seen him ghosts cant travel very far and ive never been even close to here before
1195512 i didnt recognize him at all sho ive never seen him before
1195513 can we go back to the hotel sho i dont want to be here anymore
1195514 no my boy you did not die youre alive just very sick theres a young man taking care of you you should make a full recovery under his watch
1195515 sometimes when you get sick especially as sick as you are your soul will detach itself for a short time from your body so that it doesnt get sick as well if your soul gets sick then it will die and the body cannot live for very long without the soul
1195516 unfortunately yes they are currently out looking for your body but all the snow has nearly melted so they no longer have the blood to follow which gives you a head start when you come around
1195517 would you think less of me if i said that i wanted to stay here with you rather than going back
1195518 no i wouldnt youve been through a lot these past three months i dont think anyone would blame you but you cant stay here you have to go back
1195519 i wish i were dead then i could stay with you
1195520 dont ever wish you were dead my boy being dead is nothing to look forward to no matter who you know on this side
1195521 geezus ive never seen anyone this sick in my entire life
1195522 not to mention those wounds stabbed twice and all those other cuts it looks like he just escaped from l a or something what do you think should we just take him to the hospital and be done with him
1195523 well since you think we should keep him ill trust your instincts on this raziel but still hes been like this for almost a week youd think that at least the fever would have broken by now wouldnt you
1195524 watch him for a few minutes for me boy im gonna go make us some dinner
1195525 i hope those tears are taking this sickness with them kid for your sake i dont think you can take much more of this
1195526 im the guy that saved your life but you can call me raven whats your name
1195527 saved my life great when they find me again i have you to blame
1195528 yeah im calling from the terminal are you all right you sound stressed
1195529 long boring they played austin powers as the in flight movie so i just went to sleep i dont see what people see in that movie
1195530 well people find entertainment in all sorts of things you know
1195531 actually its really sunny outside and looks pleasant i cant wait to go and check it out and see how warm it is is it still pretty warm back there
1195532 oh yes quite the end of summer and all itll linger for a while when are you heading to the school
1195533 as soon as i get off the phone with you i figured id call and let you know that id survived
1195534 huh oh raphael hes fine dear hes at work right now
1195535 no in fact im pretty confident that ill learn more here than i ever did back home despite the reason i was sent here
1195536 do us both a favor and stop lying to yourself mom he didnt do this to help me he did it because he hates me just like he hates my father
1195537 i dont want to talk about it mom look i have to get going i still have to get to the dormitories and unpack and everything so im going to go now
1195538 we dont see a focus among suppliers and vendors like ourselves because everyone looks at their implementation individually rather than as an industry implementation
1195539 the traditional storage market is completely focused on well whats the cost per gigabyte we look at whats the cost for meeting your performance metric and design systems around that architecture rather than capacity
1195540 voc falou de uma experi ncia descendo nave da igreja trinity unida de cristo ajoelhando se debaixo da cruz e tendo seus pecados remidos e submetendo se vontade de deus voc descreveria isto como uma convers o voc se considera nascido de novo

1195546 quero do mesmo modo que as mulheres se ataviem com traje decoroso com mod stia e sobriedade n o com tran as ou com ouro ou p rolas ou vestidos custosos mas como conv m a mulheres que fazem profiss o de servir a deus com boas obras

1195548 o homem n o precisa da inten o do outro para ser provocado ele tem um mecanismo cerebral que sinaliza quando aquilo que ele j definiu como algo que o atrai passa diante de seus olhos com ou sem apelo visual ele poder se sentir atra do pela mais recatada ou pela mais liberal
1195549 solteiras e casadas devem procurar refletir dentro e fora da igreja a imagem de cristo em suas atitudes gestos e na forma de se vestir
1195550 fugi da impureza 1 co 6 18 mas n o significa alienar se em um outro mundo viver longe de mulher n o faz os homens deixarem de desej las
1195551 a postura n o dura muito um finge que santo os outros fingem que acreditam
1195552 levanto os bra os e vejo se a blusa n o subiu mais do que devia
1195553 minha esposa magda figueir sempre orienta que mulheres jovens e adultas devem estar atentas ao aspecto ata do vestir crist o cuidado com a ader ncia transpar ncia e principalmente com a aus ncia
1195554 o homem n o precisa da inten o do outro para ser provocado
1195555 lembro que nosso exterior sempre refletir nosso interior e neste ponto o inimigo certamente aproveitar uma distra o para nos desviar da palavra de deus
1195556 penso que as reuni es femininas s o ocasi es prop cias para esclarecer com discernimento firmeza e amor
1195557 ainda que fechasse meus olhos minha mente n o deixaria de construir imagens o desafio fazer com que minha vis o seja lamparina para meu corpo
1195558 instalei v rias trancas cadeados e fechaduras em minha resid ncia porque n o gosto de correr riscos tomei a mesma precau o contra as provoca es da carne
1195559 a igreja deve bater firme na quest o da ordem e da dec ncia certa vez vi uma garota com uma minissaia t o curta que perdi a aten o em tudo na igreja e precisei pedir a ajuda de deus preciso de limites
1195560 a gente fica numa posi o muito dif cil cheia de cuidados para escolher a cal a comprida a saia a blusa ou o vestido o homem tamb m deve pedir a deus que controle sua mente
1195561 falo com todo o mundo mas se causei problemas foi sem perceber
1195562 mas pensar e agir com sensualidade n o s da mulher
1195563 ser que ele vai me ver como uma mulher crist e sem inten o de provocar
1195564 penso que se for para andar vestida da mesma forma que algumas meninas que n o s o da igreja andam qual a diferen a homem olha mesmo
1195565 hoje as cal as compridas continuam baixas mas n o mostram bronzeado algum
1195566 n o d para malhar na academia com suti por baixo da camisa n

1195573 os escutei e rezei por eles e inclusive batizei dois g meos filhos de pais terroristas nascidos durante um processo
1195574 por que raz o fez sofrer o seu filho na cruz
1195575 mesmo quando era bispo algumas vezes n o conseguia olhar para um crucifixo porque a d vida me atormentava

1195587 raytheon looks forward to continuing our collaborative relationship with isro and aai during this critical phase of gagan we are committed to a thorough transfer of knowledge of the gagan system to further enhance indias leadership position in air navigation
1195588 well theyre obviously not worth bothering with if the friendship is so one sided
1195589 the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal
1195590 but a hotchpotch recycling of allegations that have from time been peddled against the governments strategic defense procurement package
1195591 this time the sunday times outdoes itself by placing a spurious allegation in the public domain i e president thabo mbeki received a bribe of 30 million rands from man ferrostaal
1195592 it will be capable of transporting army and marine corps company sized units with their vehicles or reconfigure to become a troop transport for an infantry battalion its 35 45 nautical miles per hour speed allows for rapid deployment and maneuver of conventional or special operations forces the jhsv will not be a combatant vessel its construction will be similar to high speed commercial ferries used around the world and the design will include a flight deck and an off load ramp which can be lowered on a pier or quay wall allowing vehicles to quickly drive off the ship jhsvs shallow draft will allow it access to small austere ports common in developing countries this makes the jhsv an extremely flexible asset ideal for three types of missions support of relief operations in small or damaged ports as a flexible logistics support vessel for the joint commander or as the key enabler for rapid transport of a marine light armored reconnaissance company or an army stryker unit
1195593 and we will not let it go to anybody else
1195594 the most prominent dividing line in iraqi politics now is between the powers that be and the powers that arent
1195595 the powers that be spent much of the 1980s and 1990s in open opposition to saddam
1195596 which would make the system more inclusive and give the powers that arent and the popular forces they represent an opportunity for a share of the power
1195597 the longest continuous deployment of any united states ground combat military unit during operation iraqi freedom
1195598 will you regret it when youre 30 if you dont go
1195599 we werent fighting bad guys we were shooting at the national training center
1195600 there has been talk of changing the m24 to a 300 win mag
1195601 its a whole lot easier to hit a target between 800 and 1 200 meters with a 300 win mag
1195602 i would just rather rely on my right hand and a piece of metal
1195603 a gas gun is going to fail more often than a bolt gun period
1195604 two of them started firing two to three round bursts
1195605 i am a bit disturbed because we think we have solved the problem
1195606 we dont want anything out there that is not what it should be
1195607 when you want to squeeze that last bit of accuracy out of a weapon you want a bolt gun
1195608 its not that the m110 is a bad weapon it just shouldnt be the only weapon
1195609 we agree we would like to have a longer range antipersonnel system
1195610 after 1 500 meters you are going to have problems identifying targets with the optics we have today
1195611 what we are talking about conceptually is we want to retain the m24 in the sniper team
1195612 abc seems to be letting go of this show pretty quickly since theyre still burning off two episodes a week
1195613 yeeeah i dont want a girlfriend anyway so whats the weather like outside bunnies are cute i like pie what
1195614 we dont want people opening their morning paper and seeing a mohawk ad next to a picture of a floating engine
1195615 we have a regional airline so weve got a shot at a big one i know how you had it in your head the president of american airlines sees a mohawk ad falls in love and says give me that guy im sorry it didnt play out that way
1195616 her words say nyet but her eyes say maybe not nyet
1195617 thanks to you helping me get new breasts ive become everything you wished for me to be
1195618 ive seen very little footage so i dont really have a feel for it i hope they do well and i hope it is a huge hit i do hope it creates a spectacle on the screen that is what james cameron created
1195619 with batman and terminator those big movies theres a certain expectation and if you dont live up to it if the movie is not a 10 then the business will be soft if salvation is pushing it forward it will be breaking records all the time if director mcg has the t4 and the kind of shots that has the audience thinking now how did he do that then it is terminator and you can blow everyone away and every record at the box office
1195620 perhaps everything that frightens us is in its deepest essence something helpless that wants our love
1195621 history is dotted with incidents where artists and scientists have awakened to make their most notable contributions after long periods of frustration
1195622 whats your first thought if someone hesitates before giving you their opinion about your creative project
1195623 when some one hesitates before giving their opinion of my work i think it is going to be negative i recently showed some work to my boss and her criticism was so harsh that i now wont show her anything but the worse part is it made me even more conscious of showing my work to others as well
1195624 i now will show my work if it is something i am really sure of or to someone that isnt so harsh when showing some one else my work if i get a negative response i take it as some thing against me personally not too smart
1195625 its too bad that you had such a negative experience when you showed your work to your boss
1195626 i think youre absolutely wise to protect your fragile creative projects as theyre being brought into the world there are certain stages of a project when you really should choose very carefully who you share them with
1195627 it feels like things are out of control at home
1195628 as with every child born to a fae each of the four elements was flaunted in front of you to see which one your magic would recognize
1195629 the only one you even reacted to was the dirt
1195630 and i lost my ability to do anything more than parlor tricks mother those talismans are everything i can do to protect my sons father gave his life to protect his grandsons both of them
1195631 you disgraced your father he died humiliated all because you had to run off and sleep with a human
1195632 father died proudly doing what he has always done protecting his family
1195633 how can you call that that thing family he cant even do magic
1195634 he came from my womb a product of love hes my son and i expect you to treat him exactly as youd treat linden
1195635 and later tonight well be hearing from dan who is on location in new york covering a recent string of abductions but right now were going to talk to trisha mcmillan whos covering the latest developments in the james tyler murder trisha
1195636 thank you connie as many of our viewers remember three years ago these gates were thrown open by police and the state of affairs within shocked the nation
1195637 the owner of this house a mr james tyler was killed police received this disturbing phone call
1195638 i just killed james tyler i dont know the address here its a big house theres a black fence

1195640 yes the ambulances will be there soon i need you to tell me your name and stay on the line with me
1195641 im not sorry i had to stop him take good care of the boys theyve been through a lot
1195642 the boy who made the call was never identified according to several of the boys that were found inside he killed himself but of the bodies found inside none were fresh enough to have been the caller
1195643 hes the cutest little boy just makes it that much sadder doesnt it
1195644 mr johnson why dont you bring him to the bathroom
1195645 you can both get cleaned up there and ill get you some bandages for little rickys hands
1195646 i gave him a mild sedative its the only thing that calms him down once the stigmata sets in
1195647 i hope you dont think me morbid but may i see you may not have heard but i have great interest in christian mythology
1195648 if you aint gonna jump and put us both outta yer misery get yer skinny ass down an get packed were leavin firs thing in the mornin
1195649 so soon what happened this time get drunk and blow our cover again

1195651 yer new name an storys on the table get to memorizin
1195652 comunque un matematico che riuscisse a sostenere la sua profezia con terminologia e formule matematiche non verrebbe capito da nessuno ma sarebbe creduto da tutti
1195653 iniziato ad accumularsi in modo cos massiccio che i metereologi fanno fatica a tenerne il conto
1195654 stanno conducendo indagini su larga scala per stabilire come mai il clima dellartico stia diventando pi freddo e perch alcune zone del mar glaciale artico siano diventate negli ultimi tempi minacciosamente pi spesse e se lestensione di questa coltre ghiacciata contribuisca a preparare nuove ere glaciali
1195655 gli scienziati sempre loro temono che lequilibrio climatico nel mondo stia per finire
1195656 dallo studio di campioni di ghiaccio estratti dalla calotta groenlandese sembra che 89 500 anni fa qualcosa di catastrofico abbia modificato il clima portandolo da una temperatura maggiore di quella odierna a quella di una piena era glaciale
1195657 il clima del mondo sta cambiando di questo gli scienziati immancabili sono fermamente convinti ma perch e in quale direzione lo stia facendo oggetto di un acceso dibattito
1195658 questinverno chicago rimasta paralizzata dalla neve linverno scorso fu boston europea ha visto il dicembre pi freddo da un secolo a questa parte
1195659 gli scienziati arieccoli hanno resuscitato la controversa idea che milioni di miglia cubiche di ghiaccio antartico possano in certi casi scivolare improvvisamente dal continente nel mare col risultato di incrementare spaventosamente il livello degli oceani e accelerare il drammatico raffreddamento del clima mondiale
1195660 alcune scoperte nellartico confermano la teoria dellinnalzamento delle temperature globali un misterioso riscaldamento del clima si sta lentamente manifestando nellartico dando vita a un serio problema internazionale lo ha detto oggi il dr hans ahlmann noto geofisico svedese
1195661 la teoria che il mondo si stia lentamente riscaldando ha ricevuto nuove conferme dai dati delle temperature
1195662 il nostro clima sta forse cambiando il succedersi di estati temperate e di inverni miti da diversi anni a questa parte culminato lo scorso inverno nella quasi totale assenza di croste di ghiaccio nella valle dellhudson rende questa domanda pertinente i concittadini pi anziani ci dicono che gli inverni non sono pi freddi come quando loro erano giovani e noi tutti abbiamo potuto notare una notevole diminuzione media del freddo in questultimo decennio
1195663 poich il clima di ogni paese ha una relazione inseparabile con le caratteristiche fisiche dei suoi abitanti lattenzione del governo si rivolta da alcuni anni a questa parte alla raccolta di precise statistiche meteorologiche nel territorio di tutti gli stati uniti
1195664 prospettive di un nuovo periodo glaciale i geologi pensano che il mondo stia per ghiacciarsi di nuovo
1195665 uno sguardo alle notizie riportate dai media di lamentele sul fatto che il clima non perfetto raccolte da john shotsky
1195666 hi stan i have thought a lot about emr from my days in academia to my days in private practice based on my hands on experience with computerizing labs i realized that computers work best for essentially mindless repetitive tasks or tasks that are the same each time like accumulating holding reporting and filing data it can also deal with machine control bar code tasks etc any higher order functions like thinking is still not workable that is what makes computerization of cognitive processes so difficult and is probably at the root of why emr is not practiced more widely add to that the punitive action by insurance and govt use or potential use of the data makes emr a non starter if basic patient data demographics clinical findings take your shirt off mam or sir history and treatment could be hooked up with a large data base to guide the physician to make her him more effective efficient and better paid than it will fly
1195667 the movie is in color in focus and you can hear it
1195668 i hate it i love you but i hate it
1195669 and features buck flower who we loved in ilsa she wolf of the ss
1195670 im looking forward to the remake i cant say much more about it nothings confirmed nothings locked
1195671 it has a lot of good will so to speak people look on it favorably im not a big fan of remakes but they happen all the time
1195672 when porter got on the stand that was a mistake i would say for the defense
1195673 i dont think he meant to burn anybody he got some bad counsel to make this all about the bible and god all he needed to do was say he was sorry but he wouldnt do that
1195674 the student goes we support mr freshwater the bible stays
1195675 nobodys ever told me to remove my bible or to remove the other religious material hanging on my walls
1195676 and not just to take what a teacher said as a fact
1195677 lo que evidencia patentemente la conferencia de prensa del s bado en la residencia presidencial de olivos es que finalmente con disgusto seguramente con muy pocas ganas de hacerlo han terminado concediendo que los medios de comunicaci n son una expresi n de la sociedad civil
1195678 los medios de comunicaci n son una expresi n de la sociedad civil
1195679 it was an innocent thing and no harm was meant by it
1195680 we have given a commitment to not run the footage and we have apologised to the ioc
1195681 there is no reason to hope that the u s s leading role in the push to create a palestinian state will prompt the palestinian authority to reverse this hate ideology
1195682 there is a huge gap between us and our enemies not just in ability but in morality culture sanctity of life and conscience they are our neighbors here but it seems as if at a distance of a few hundred meters away there are people who do not belong to our continent to our world but actually belong to a different galaxy
1195683 there was no such thing as palestinians they never existed
1195684 which sought to establish two nations in the land of israel
1195685 when we complete the permanent agreement we will hold 78 percent of the land while the palestinians will control 22 percent
1195686 we got orders to knock on every door enter and take out all the males the younger ones we lined up with their faces against the wall and soldiers beat them with billy clubs this was no private initiative these were orders from our company commander after one soldier finished beating a detainee another soldier called him you nazi and the first man shot back you bleeding heart when one soldier tried to stop another from beating an arab for no reason a fist fight broke out
1195687 israeli interrogators routinely ill treat and torture arab prisoners prisoners are hooded or blindfolded and are hung by their wrists for long periods most are struck in the genitals or in other ways sexually abused most are sexually assaulted others are administered electric shock
1195688 there is no country in the world in which the use of official and sustained torture is as well established and documented as in the case of israel
1195689 arbitrators who may seek to develop reputations for being friendly to particular parties or particular industries may actually have incentives that cut against independence
1195690 the argument that aggrieved parties can always seek vacatur of the award is an inadequate response
1195691 parties to arbitration are not bound to any confidentiality obligation
1195692 many arbitration rules and some arbitration laws specifically provide for the confidentiality of proceedings and in addition the confidentiality of any award
1195693 arbitrations often take place under the guise of confidentiality so even assuming that a party were willing to undertake the investment of investigating an arbitrator the party may be stymied in its efforts to learn much about an arbitrators or an institutions reputation

1195719 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males title such as
1195720 they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
1195721 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest

1195751 i was looking at the organisational chart from 2001 we had 25 people and eight are still with the business
1195752 i have to focus on one thing my objective is to go into a large organisation and help it grow something
1195753 there are great global opportunities particularly in emerging markets in asia india and eastern europe i like to create long term value online whether it is jobs real estate its all about classified ads my knowledge and skills are very transferable
1195754 it needs a pragmatist who can understand the future of the business it also needs someone who can understand the culture we work hard and we play hard we have a lot of fun in what we do while having a lot of respect for people we are collaborative and work in a team in everything we do we are like one big family
1195755 it has north of 1 million revenue and 10 staff its a little business that makes a little bit of money that is then reinvested so we break even we are in the uk and now do stuff in the us they will be happy to see more of me

1195759 australia is not the game australia is the stepping stone it has given us the right to grow i could never have half a billion in revenues by staying local so i have to go into other countries at this stage i am not sure which single other country will be the golden egg so we are going into multiple countries

1195763 we had a very easy way in which we could approach the new zealand market
1195764 so absolutely i think for us it was the right thing to do because it allowed us at a low cost to experiment into a new market
1195765 we kept a close eye on where we were spending the money it was a case of use one piece of toilet paper at a time we were very open about how we were going financially i showed staff the revenues explained what the costs were and how the money was being spent i said to them if we keep spending like this no one is going to put any money into us and that really engaged people in the future of the business

1195774 in a scenario like this if a suspect has really walked the walk then the addition of this technique will make it much more difficult for him to talk the talk to get out of it
1195775 it could help to solve a crime 10 years on despite the fact shoes wear out so quickly these days because peoples walk tends not to change
1195776 if the way a person walks and leaves a footprint is unique to them then we should be able to record it for crime scene purposes and it should have evidential value as people cannot yet fly they have to walk into the crime scene
1195777 allowing for certain illnesses how you walk should generally remain with you for life if we can record an image of how a suspects foot falls on a particular surface and we know that this footprint remains consistent we could then compare it to a mark left by a suspect at a crime scene
1195778 the patterns of existing footwear evidence which can have a shorter lifespan due to additional damage and markings caused by further wear of the shoe by an individual would also be strengthened by the new developments
1195779 there are certain characteristics on a persons foot that will remain the same for example if you have bunions then they will always be present and will give you a certain wear mark
1195780 if youve got a very rigid first toe then that will also give you a certain wear mark
1195781 used on its own this will not necessarily convict a criminal but used alongside other evidence it will present a more robust case to the court
1195782 when the word for taxes sounded rather like the word for pig the pharoh boldly put down a pig as a bad pun and chanced it so a modern hieroglyphist might represent at once by unscrupulously drawing a hat followed by a series of upright numerals it was good enough for the pharoh and it ought to be good enough for him but it must have been great fun to write or even to read these messages when writing and reading were really a new thing the king among his priests and all of them roaring with laighter and bubbling over with suggestions as the royal puns grew more wild and indefensible

1195784 o wretched man that i am who will deliver me from this body of death
1195785 our old man was crucified with him that the body of sin might be done away with that we should no longer be slaves of sin
1195786 and the spirit of god was hovering over the face of the waters
1195787 human nature with its frailties physically or morally and passions 3
1195788 for my flesh is food indeed and my blood is drink indeed
1195789 for he made him who knew no sin to be sin for us that we might become the righteousness of god in him 2 corinthians 5 21
1195790 for years mankind was under the law of sin and death when we would want to do good evil was present we were bound by sin and death just as were bound by the law of gravity
1195791 all christians experience the battle of flesh against spirit were chained to a dead man and wherever we go we drag this old carcass with us its smelly corrupt and we hate it yet were bound to it
1195792 a man may know the truth but its application can cause intense problems
1195793 we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffs up but love edifies

1195797 the lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually
1195798 which if a man do he shall live in them
1195799 any religious system teaching that help can be found within us is bound to fail
1195800 the indwelling holy spirit is the christians sole power against the flesh 13
1195801 note now at once that all self hope has ceased it is not how shall i deliver myself or even how shall i be delivered but it is a frantic appeal for a deliverer
1195802 for by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves
1195803 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation old things have passed away behold all things have become new
1195804 but now it is no longer i who do it but sin that dwells in me
1195805 being born again takes a moment of faith but becoming like christ is a lifelong process
1195806 it is both our privileged and our duty to be joyful to be joyful is to experience the power of the holy spirit within us and to say to a watching world our god reigns

1195823 being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus
1195824 being regarded and treated as if innocent or acquittal from the consequences of guilt before the tribunal of god
1195825 the law is not relaxed or set aside but is declared to be fulfilled in the strictest sense and so the person justified is declared to be entitled to all the advantages and reward
1195826 now the doctrine of works has this condition attached to it that is if you do and the doctrine of faith has this condition that is if you believe
1195827 god has devised a plan by which they may be pardoned and saved and that is by faith alone this is the grand peculiarity of the christian religion
1195828 therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law
1195829 witnessed by the law and the prophets that is there were types and prophecies and promises in the old testament that pointed at this the law is so far from justifying us that it directs us to another way of justification points at christ as our righteousness to whom bear all the prophets witness
1195830 to him all the prophets witness that through his name whoever believes in him will receive remission of sins
1195831 he believed in the lord and he accounted it to him for righteousness
1195832 by faith abel offered to god a more excellent sacrifice than cain through which he obtained witness that he was righteous
1195833 truly i know it is so but how can a man be righteous before god if one wished to contend with him he could not answer him one time out of a thousand
1195834 though i were righteous my own mouth would condemn me though i were blameless it would prove me perverse
1195835 for you do not desire sacrifice or else i would give it you do not delight in burnt offering the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart these o god you will not despise
1195836 but we are all like an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags
1195837 do not enter into judgment with your servant for in your sight no one living is righteous
1195838 for though you wash yourself with lye and use much soap yet your iniquity is marked before me
1195839 in acquitting us before his bar god regards not our works in whole or in part but the atoning work and merits of christ
1195840 now to him who works the wages are not counted as grace but as debt
1195841 a right relationship with god is a gift that i do not cannot and never will deserve this gift demonstrates the grace of god as he gives me what i could never earn perfect righteousness
1195842 man in his depraved state under the power of such corruption could never by any works of his own gain acceptance with god but it must be resolved purely into the free grace of god
1195843 god accounts righteous the believing ungodly as such not those who are first to be in any wise changed and then reckoned righteous the believing ungodly are to be reckoned righteous while they are still ungodly
1195844 to him who does not work but believes on him who justifies the ungodly his faith is accounted for righteousness
1195845 for when we were still without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly
1195846 that while we were still sinners christ died for us
1195847 as for you you shall keep my covenant you and your descendants after you throughout their generations
1195848 for what if some did not believe will their unbelief make the faithfulness of god without effect certainly not indeed let god be true but every man a liar
1195849 thus also faith by itself if it does not have works is dead
1195850 you see then that a man is justified by works and not by faith only
1195851 for whoever shall keep the whole law and yet stumble in one point he is guilty of all
1195852 show me your faith without your works and i will show you my faith by my works
1195853 do you see that faith was working together with his works and by works faith was made perfect
1195854 a living faith naturally results in good works works are the thermometer of faith and measure its sincerity and fervor
1195855 only an instrument by which the soul appropriates or apprehends christ and his righteousness
1195856 good works while not the ground are the certain consequence of justification
1195857 o wretched man that i am who will deliver me from this body of death
1195858 why do you keep mourning over your bad works your failures
1195859 i had justification from god as a sinner not as a saint my saintliness does not increase it nor praise god do my failures decrease it
1195860 for by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest anyone should boast
1195861 so when jesus had received the sour wine he said it is finished and bowing his head he gave up his spirit
1195862 a centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard but paul was permitted to dwell by himself with the soldier who guarded him
1195863 that finally overcame the jewish people eventually scattering them so that they could not return to their land for two thousand years
1195864 for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation on his head he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak
1195865 to the leather apron beneath the armor or to the metal belt protecting the lower abdomen 2
1195866 the military girdle was not however a mere sword sash but a strong belt that was designed to strengthen the body and at the same to cover such portions of the abdomen as might be unprotected
1195867 the integrating force in the life of the victorious christian
1195868 instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be complete thoroughly equipped for every good work
1195869 the breastplate normally consisted of leather overlaid with metal and it protected the chest in battle
1195870 the sanctifying righteousness of christ practiced in a believers life
1195871 satan is the accuser but he cannot accuse the believer who is living a godly life in the power of the spirit the life we live either fortifies us against satans attacks or makes it easier for him to defeat us
1195872 so they could advance toward the enemy undistracted about what they might step on this gear was essential to their preparation for battle
1195873 bound by thongs over the instep and round the ankle and having the soles thickly studded with nails
1195874 was sometimes used in the sense of establishment or firm foundation which would suit this passage
1195875 to a believers stability or surefootedness from the gospel which gives him peace so he can stand in the battle
1195876 in this passage the gospel of peace refers to the good news that believers are at peace with god
1195877 satan shoots fiery darts at our hearts and minds lies blasphemous thoughts hateful thoughts about others doubts and burning desires for sin
1195878 living faith a trust in the promises and the power of god
1195879 the faith to which paul refers here is not the body of christian beliefs but basic trust in god it is the faith in christ that continues to bring blessing and strength as it trusts him for daily provision and help
1195880 putting on the breastplate of faith and love and as a helmet the hope of salvation
1195881 when we shall one day be saved altogether and forever from sins presence
1195882 live according to gods standard with access to and trust in what god has said
1195883 the word of god is living and powerful and sharper than any two edged sword
1195884 piercing even to the division of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart
1195885 a material sword pierces the body but the word of god pierces the heart a physical sword wounds to hurt and kill while the sword of the spirit wounds to heal and give life

1195900 you mean the hordes of canadians breathlessly poised to overrun america with deadly hockey sticks
1195901 forget the emergency influx of immigrants ruse whats this rapid development of new programs the swift incarceration of thousands of americans protesting the imposition of martial law perhaps
1195902 i wish i were imagining things unfortunately horrors like domestic detention facilities are but one verifiable piece of an all encompassing all intrusive system bushco has methodically installed to take unchallenged control of america instantly
1195903 hes not bad i guess you know for an iraqi i even loaned him five bucks the other day
1195904 then youd better hope his views of what the bushies are doing to his country are in line with theirs
1195905 thats your concern ahmeds suddenly suspect appearance rather than an insanely vague executive order
1195906 your anti americanism mark blinds you to seeing that anyone could be a terrorist you just never know and unfortunately theres no machine that can look into peoples hearts
1195907 in june the transportation security administration installed body scanner devices in ten major u s airports that produce essentially naked photographs of travelers
1195908 maybe i should call and apply as a scanner operator heh heh
1195909 knock yourself out just pray tsa hasnt out sourced its call center to say india because under the new fisa bill any message you send to or receive from overseas is fair game for the government warrant or probable cause be damned ill bet apolitica would love to hear that tape played in court
1195910 if the pending violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism prevention act becomes law banish that thought from your mind as well as many others
1195911 this bill is thought crime codified establishing a national commission to provide legislative recommendations for stopping those peskily ubiquitous homegrown terrorists from among other things developing and spreading within the united states the use planned use or threatened use of force or violence by a group or individual to promote the group or individuals political religious or social beliefs
1195912 not much i guess other than its so broadly and absurdly written that anyone at a demonstration for example could be deemed a terrorist
1195913 like all those ones youve attended i think ill call my senator tomorrow to push that bill unlike certain america haters i know i believe in doing everything possible to defeat evildoers
1195914 why wait why not instead ask your boss if hes one of the 23 000 fbi deputized private industry members of infragard who according to matthew rothschild of the progressive preferentially receive secret warnings of terrorist threats before the public does if so then maybe you too could attend infragard meetings like that at which one participant reported he and others were told by homeland security and the fbi that when not if martial law is declared it was our responsibility to protect our portion of the infrastructure and if we had to use deadly force to protect it we couldnt be prosecuted does that not get your attention
1195915 absolutely it sounds like an even better gig than eyeballing nudie shots of airline passengers uh i mean performing confidential inspections in the name of national security ok you two lets go
1195916 sorry to ruin your day but i gotta help my boss install a new grill over at the sloppy burger
1195917 hey dolt do you think after you two hook that thing up youll eventually end up cooking burgers on it
1195918 of course why would anyone go to all the trouble to put something in place and then not use it
1195919 the next time you need to know something mean to do you need to call me
1195920 the single most important national security threat we face is the threat of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists what i did was reach out to senator dick lugar republican to help lock down loose nuclear weapons
1195921 on the foreign relations committee obama passed a law to keep nuclear weapons out of terrorists hands
1195922 introducing legislation today at the request of the executive branch and will be seeking unanimous consent to request its passage as soon as possible

1195959 encouraging students to skip school to attend these candlelight vigils and rallies is not only inappropriate and outside the bounds of a teacher student relationship but it detracts attention from more pressing issues students are facing
1195960 namely they are far more likely to be killed on field trips or while walking home from school than by contracting mad cow disease which as of yet has claimed no korean or korean american lives
1195961 what galls me the most is that these foreigners are growing fat and rich in korea teaching their native tongue while making fun of the same people who are paying their wages
1195962 i need your other koreans help in correcting this kind of behaviors sic from foreigners i would like you to e mail the editor and those of you who are local to suncheon should track down this brian deutsche sic and find out which school or hagwon he teaches in you can assist me when you find that information i seek full and unfettered cooperation in my campaign to correct this foreigners behavior if we cannot do that to a foreigner on our own soil how can we hope to correct the behavior of u s president bush
1195963 before you try to learn about korea via a korean you should learn korean and ask the questions in korean first
1195964 our role is to offer commentary and criticism from a fresh outside perspective
1195965 that being said its easy to overthink these things personally i dont think the foreign observer has any special role beyond that of any observer which is to say relaying observations he or she has made
1195966 all countries are open for criticism the question that really needs to be asked is whether anyone should take what we write seriously for the most part the answer to that would be no
1195967 most of us are guys with too much time on our hands who like to bitch about things we dont really understand which granted would make our uneducated rants little different from much of what passes for commentary on korea western or korean
1195968 i have a warning on my blog asking readers not to generalize from anything they read on my site but still many seem to do it anyway besides generalizations are kind of fun nationalistically hysterical koreans pot smoking over sexed english teachers condescending expats who doesnt love em its all a question of how seriously you take what you read
1195969 the fact that were foreigners shouldnt disqualify us i look at american social commentary and social criticism and some of our sharpest and best social critics have been foreigners people coming from a foreign perspective
1195970 we have eyes we have ears we can read your newspapers we read what you read we have access to your information
1195971 i pay taxes i buy things i live here so why do i have any less say than you do
1195972 why would i put all this effort why would i even care or put myself out there why would i do this if i didnt actually give a expletive
1195973 i find the notion that only koreans are permitted to speak about korean problems simply absurd
1195974 that isnt to say that all foreigners opinions on them are equally valid but if the roles were reversed then id be quite happy to hear the opinions of say a korean person who had spent some time in new zealand and who made an active effort to study and know new zealand society and learn the language
1195975 the majority of netizens aside ive actually found a significant number of koreans to feel much the same way about the opinions of non koreans
1195976 koreans are not unique in readily dismissing the opinions of foreigners but they do seem more defensive about foreign criticism than most for that reason it is very important to use korean sources as much as possible
1195977 another advantage to using and considering korean language sources as much as possible is that it makes you realize how much you may stereotype and generalize koreans yourself without being aware of it
1195978 without any korean ability foreigners are usually forced to rely on either the limited english language media or books for the bulk of their information and both have problems the former for often presenting a rose tinted version of korea to the world and the latter for being quickly out of date in a country as rapidly changing as korea
1195979 do it in korean and in a major korean newspaper
1195980 many complaints from expats that the korean has seen show a certain level of ignorance
1195981 expats rarely venture out of large cities in korea and they only really interact with koreans who are fluent in english do you know what makes a korean fluent in english money tons and tons of it so not only are expats insulated from older koreans they are also insulated from younger koreans who are poorer what kind of understanding about korea could an expat possibly have with this kind of limited exposure
1195982 naming a problem is the first step to solving it and maybe some of these critics are attempting to be a legitimate part of that process that is theyre writing because they want to see korea become a better place in which case koreans who are upset about non koreans criticizing korea need to stop and take a careful look at why that upsets them because the problem does not lie in the complainers or their intentions
1195983 to be fair sometimes the social critics intentions are good but their methods are poor the sometimes bitter and mean tone of certain critics can be hurtful and as ive said to some of my friends who complain about korea with a rude or condescending tone when you talk so harshly even when youre right youre wrong and even if you win the argument you still lose
1195984 i like doing it and i like staying on top of current events and discussions
1195985 ive also had to question how welcome those opinions are
1195986 but i think foreigners do have a right to speak about problems in korea and to address sensitive issues from our own perspectives
1195987 moreover these issues are so prickly because theyre not black and white while it might be unpleasant for some koreans to hear the other side of the story i dont think its inappropriate for it to be raised
1195988 our opinions are often dismissed with a line about you dont understand korean culture
1195989 i realize that a greater measure of tact is necessary when addressing sensitive issues and when trying to foster conversations across cultural boundaries but even with a lot of coddling i remain cynical that people are ready to hear what we have to say just yet
1195990 i would love to have koreans who disagree with me take the time to point out their objections rather than simply railing against a foreigner who dares to publish something against the grain and i would love to have koreans spend more time trying to educate us about their culture and their views then since so much energy is spent telling us how wrong and misinformed our opinions are

1196010 the development process of the downtown master plan with 20 public sessions since last year has been the most transparent in the citys history i urge council to bring this plan to a vote at no later than its october meeting
1196011 if council had done its homework and followed the developments of the master plan there would be little need for multiple public hearings the public has already done its homework and made its voice heard loud and clear
1196012 nothing dilutes the voice of the public like campaign contributions and political favors and the only way we can remain certain this plan stays true to the public is to approve it before the election
1196013 unfortunately councils track record of delaying and continuing important items is well known from inaction on the 16 month old charter commission to missing the deadline for preparing the fy 2009 budget citizens will know who to hold responsible if the master plan languishes for months with no action

1196298 when a blind man cries that leaves the 2ch person with just over 37 minutes of what is arguably great music
1196299 everyone is busting their butts and we are excited about the year its always intense at practice and it is really the only atmosphere you need to have a successful team to have everyone compete and everyone going after that no 1 spot that is the only way we are going to be successful
1196300 were going to have a better team than we did last year we are much more experienced on the offensive side of the ball which is exciting we are getting tony back which is huge for our offense our receivers from last year got a lot of good experience that will make things more competitive during camp and will hopefully make us better as a team i dont think we can go backward getting those guys some experience and getting everyone back healthy i just dont see us doing any worse than we did last year
1196301 jake is the frontrunner right now no question about it
1196302 he has pushed jake to the hilt especially coming out of spring ball those guys were virtually neck and neck when youre being pushed and do as well as you can possibly do during each and every rep and series or practice that has a way of making you perform a lot better
1196303 i have no doubts in my ability it will be healthy competition but in my eyes i am the guy
1196304 right now we have a lot of young guys everywhere offensively
1196305 they do have some experience we have to count on those guys to know what they are doing and then execute we need to execute better than we did a year ago
1196306 hes a guy who knows the system and played hard and played well when tony went down last year we expect him to have his best season because its his last year
1196307 last year was definitely hard on the receiver and tight end positions
1196308 we have everybody back healthy and we have a lot of depth this year so its going to be nice to know that if anybody goes down we have somebody that has already had game experience to back us up
1196309 experience is huge and pretty much everyone on offense has a year under their belt
1196310 that can only help so were excited if everyone contributes it should open up outside receivers and open up inside routes
1196311 if you have studied us over the years we probably use more two tight end sets
1196312 we are probably one of half dozen teams in the country that are always trying to find ways to get tight ends on the field because of the mismatches they can cause and the way they force the defense to simplify what theyre doing
1196313 there is pressure on every position out there on the field by having those two veteran guys it will help the offense and they can be a very productive force with the way we use them and all the game experience they have
1196314 originally art was made by a minority for a minority then it became art by a minority for the majority and now we are at the beginning of a new era where art is intended by the majority for the majority
1196315 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
1196316 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
1196317 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
1196318 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
1196319 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
1196320 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
1196321 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
1196322 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
1196323 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
1196324 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
1196325 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
1196326 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

1196355 but surprisingly our client research shows that critical decision page metrics are often being overlooked or are missing from the analysis altogether and when visibility and insight around this specific point in the sales funnel are lacking its much more difficult to diagnose the major strategic and tactical issues impacting profitability and growth
1196356 a single conversion ratio orders to visits is simply too general to be very useful beyond just getting a vague sense of how a site is performing it provides no real insight into exactly where the critical deficiencies are
1196357 are visitors to decision pages compelled forward to the next step in the sales cycle a similar offline scenario would be a shopper taking a product off the shelf studying its features and price then deciding whether to put it back or put it into their cart

1196450 after a fierce and lengthy debate the state house of representatives voted thursday night to give new tax credits to the film industry the bill which passed on a voice vote would offer tax breaks to film companies that build studios in massachusetts and is intended to solidify hollywoods growing presence here
1196451 would provide a 20 percent tax break for the cost of building new studios and production facilities the fact is that the film tax incentives are a proven lure to the industry which happily doesnt then have to make vancouver look like boston and they are issued only when the cameras start rolling with the studio credits the state would be taking a chance that they wont turn out to be empty monuments to big hollywood dreams courtesy of the struggling taxpayers

1196523 they didnt have any teabags kenny but i bought you ruud gullit instead
1196524 we have a strong finnish tradition in the team and i ve seen both mika and kimi take their first grand prix wins while driving for mclaren
1196525 with heikki yesterday s result was fully justified and very much deserved he s had his fair share of bad luck during the early part of the season and his win in hungary showed that he d let none of that misfortune pile up on his shoulders
1196526 and we ve seen with all our other drivers that once they get that winning feeling it s something they want to keep doing
1196527 clearly we are targeting ferrari in the constructors championship and it will only be to our benefit to have both our drivers pushing as hard as possible to close down that points gap
1196528 clearly felipe was strong in budapest particularly in the early part of the race and we come away from hungary with a clear intention of understanding where that perceived uplift of performance came from
1196529 in our second stint i think we started to turn our fortunes around we pitted later than felipe fuelled lewis significantly longer than the ferrari and had a performance advantage despite the heavier fuel load we felt confident that we would have been in a significantly stronger position going into the last stint but unfortunately lewis s tyre problem not only forced him to complete the best part of a lap on a flat tyre he suffered the failure at turn one and the tyre was flat by turn two but also caused him to pit earlier than anticipated this not only negated the fuel advantage he was originally carrying but forced him to look after his super soft tyres over a far longer stint than we had originally anticipated that he managed to do that so effortlessly is a great testament to his presence of mind and his fifth position during an afternoon of damage limitation was a truly impressive result
1196530 the reality is that you can t isolate the advantages that a singular piece of aerodynamic componentry brings to the car s performance
1196531 it s a testament not just to our design and windtunnel teams but also to our model making and manufacturing departments that we have been able to bring so many new items like these to recent races and our aggressive development strategy shows no sign of slowing down this is where the world championship will be won or lost we ve seen it happen before
1196532 we are undertaking two 50km shakedown tests ahead of valencia we re also continually developing new parts for the car as our simulation and development departments continue to produce new parts we ll take a view as to whether they ll be raced we won t disclose what they are but i m sure you ll see some new components appear during friday testing at the next race
1196533 we tested the engine cover dorsal fin during the pre german grand prix test at hockenheim its intended aim was to improve the car s sensitivity during yaw but we found that some of the advantage it brought to that area was being offset elsewhere as you can clearly see it is a large structure and one that is particularly sensitive to crosswinds we felt that our car already delivers sufficiently in yaw and that continuing to experiment with the dorsal fin might not bring us the sufficient performance benefit we d require to make it worthwhile as such it is not something we are giving priority to at the moment
1196534 we ve been paying very close attention to the construction of the new shorefront circuit in valencia and are convinced it is going to be an exciting addition to the formula 1 calendar and an absolutely top line facility
1196535 and we ve left no stone unturned we ve even been studying onboard racing footage of the circuit to get an idea of where the overtaking opportunities lie unlike most street circuits however valencia is unusual in that it is relatively high speed track and will require a much lower downforce set up than we d normally see at a place like monte carlo for example we are anticipating a fascinating engineering challenge and while there s always an element of uncertainty whenever you arrive at a new facility we re confident we ve done as competent a job as we can of preparing for it

1196567 i dont think that the fed can really pull any of its levers to create a short term fix
1196568 to go higher i think we need the sentiment to change with lower energy prices crude oil dropping below the 117 area certainly would provide a very visible benefit in terms of the economy

1196570 for the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god

1196572 wait patiently for the lord be brave and courageous yes wait patiently for the lord
1196573 my will is that cyrus whom i have appointed to be king over many and great nations send back my people to their own land and build my temple
1196574 for the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god
1196575 no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him and i will raise him up at the last day
1196576 it is not so much if i am right but what if you are wrong you owe it to yourself to look at this more intensely and with honesty
1196577 god isnt saying that it is better to be foolish or uneducated
1196578 in putting the strong and wise and great to shame god does not exalt the weak and uneducated and worthless but brings all of them down to one common level
1196579 god has called the weak and ignorant first but not exclusively shepherds first then wise men fishermen first then the educated like paul who was himself an educated man
1196580 the ancient christians were for the most part slaves and men of low station the whole history of the expansion of the church is in reality a progressive victory of the ignorant over the learned the lowly over the lofty until the emperor himself laid down his crown before the cross of christ
1196581 christ in you is the certain guaranteed hope of glory
1196582 for the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god
1196583 because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men
1196584 i would have lost heart unless i had believed that i would see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living

1196587 the wind picked up and in probably five seconds it blew my friend into her husband

1196591 si conoce a alguien que le gusta tres minutos son suficientes si no le gusta 30 segundos es demasiado largo

1196595 his mother had no job no pension no husband so from a young age ratko had to fight to survive

1196601 the way that china deals with taiwan will assuage or fuel anxiety over the way china deals with the other neighbors
1196602 beijings most important concern is to not destroy the olympics
1196603 as things stand i seriously question the advice that is coming to the government from land transport new zealand ltnz their recommendations are undermining public transport in favour of putting capital into roading it seems pretty obvious that as a result roading is being overcapitalised if this continues we are unlikely to have the right transport infrastructure mix for our economy in the future
1196604 the government are spending 6 dollars on roads for every 1 dollar they spend on public transport
1196605 thats simply not good enough ltnz seem to be grossly under pricing the rapidly rising cost of oil the era of 1 a litre petrol is well and truly over government decisions need to be based upon realistic projections our dependence upon roads has been lubricated by cheap oil
1196606 this creates the wrong picture of public transport and the people who use it it discriminates against some of the most vulnerable in our society for example the elderly youth disabled people and those people who cannot afford to drive it also strangely discriminates against people who actively choose not to drive
1196607 would to god that all the lords people were prophets

1196614 enough the phony leaders dead end movements and culture of failure that are undermining black america and what we can do about it
1196615 it is ignorance on the part of people in the corrections system who dont know what the laws are
1196616 most know they have to get an interpreter for a spanish speaker but when its a deaf person they think the person just cant hear they dont realize its a whole different language and culture

1196621 at first we werent sure if this was just a fad
1196622 but after a while we realized that it was the right thing to do
1196623 companies need to learn to value the community much more
1196624 running a small business has opened my eyes to the whole process independent designers cant close their eyes to what is going on ceos in the corporate machine dont see everything the decision to go green by a big company might simply be a marketing decision in a small company the owners see the product through its entire life cycle they are the ones making the purchases contributing to the designs and living the details of their organization it is much easier to understand the impact you have on the community at that scale

1196633 its strange to see hunger when everything is so green
1196634 this emergency is occurring in an environment of spectacular success in agriculture
1196635 the vast majority of farmers have never had it so good
1196636 ethiopians are not hapless they are not helpless we are making a real dent in poverty
1196637 we have not moved far enough away from the poverty line for us to have enough cushion
1196638 one unexpected weather event can push us over the precipice
1196639 heard about the recent news reports implying i may have found martian life those reports are incorrect reports claiming there was a white house briefing are also untrue and incorrect
1196640 the report of a white house briefing is not true and is bogus
1196641 we are attempting to assess the chemicals and minerals that make up the soil composition we are now about half way through the process and there are several conflicting points of view this is not a good time to go public with half the story
1196642 we are committed to following a rigorous scientific process while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results initial meca analyses suggested earth like soil further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry
1196643 the reason that all this seems so hush hush is due to a future paper and press release that appears likely to pop out of the american association for the advancement of science aaas and its science magazine whatever the poop is from the scoop thats been studied by phoenix that information is purportedly going through peer review
1196644 to protect the interests and ensure the safety of all concerned
1196645 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1196646 if videotapes were made they were likely used for translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1196647 we knew for a while that all the interrogations and questioning was being recorded and that that was the routine
1196648 we sent a total of three teams and it was common knowledge that all the interviews with the detainees were videotaped and recorded
1196649 is this going to result in a kind of blessed censorship of a whole host of areas of medical care and research
1196650 they are manipulating the system by manipulating the definition of the word abortion
1196651 its another example of this administrations disregard for science and medicine in how agencies make decisions
1196652 its a redefinition of abortion that does not match any of the current medical definitions its ideologically based and not based on science and could interfere with the development of many new therapies to treat diseases
1196653 my main objective in my discussions on religious freedom is to remind this new generation of leadership that religion is not to be feared but to be welcomed in society
1196654 oh i think he listens absolutely i think hes interested he absorbs he takes in he listens
1196655 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1196656 one of the reasons im going is because i want to show respect to the chinese people and this is a proud moment for china
1196657 while approving a sentence of death for a member of our armed services is a serious and difficult decision for a commander in chief the president believes the facts of this case leave no doubt that the sentence is just and warranted
1196658 tell your little friend that the rules have been up for a year
1196659 you are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in no one is fanatically shouting that the sun is going to rise tomorrow they know its going to rise tomorrow when people are fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals its because the dogmas or goals are in doubt
1196660 its an insult to americas workers for the department of labor to be spending its time in the last year of this administration allegedly fine tuning the details of how to do these regulations when other than the one ordered by a court they have issued no major worker health regulations
1196661 the reality is theres a great need to light a fire under this moribund agency to do something anything to protect workers
1196662 the fact that the department of labor seems to be engaged in secret rulemaking makes me highly suspicious that some high level political appointees are up to no good this congress will not stand for the gutting of health and safety protections as the bush administration heads out the door
1196663 people appear to be making assumptions about whats in the draft
1196664 aviso queridos todos nos tuvimos que encerrar en el hospital no ten amos internet y se me perdi por completo el orden del pasar del tiempo por fin milagros su mujer lo conect ma ana les contamos c mo anda la cosa
1196665 the biowatch program has been variously described by my fellow state and local laboratory directors as a parasite to the public health laboratory and squatters in valuable public health laboratory space
1196666 it has not yet developed an overarching strategic plan to guide its transition
1196667 dhs must develop a reliable means to assure the american people that major investments in this architecture will in fact make us measurably safer against catastrophic nuclear terrorism
1196668 once the collapse begins adversaries have a real opportunity to gain advantage
1196669 in terms of the bush presidency this many reversals this close to the end destroys credibility it appears there is no depth to which this administration will not sink in its last days
1196670 its a recognition that if they dont make these moves theyll be left with nothing
1196671 fruits of the diplomatic labor that weve been engaged in in the last couple of years
1196672 the actions that weve taken this week are all tactical moves brought about by the overarching strategy that the president has put in place
1196673 shall leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife and the two shall become one flesh
1196674 are all telling us the same thing they need something like this in there iraqis want to know that foreign troops are not going to be here forever
1196675 take the heat off maliki a little bit to rebrand the thing and counter the narrative that hes negotiating for a permanent military presence in iraq
1196676 but with u s forces in potential combat situations we have some real bottom lines
1196677 but even on that question its one thing on immunity if in the iraqi mind its an agreement for u s troops forever
1196678 its another thing if these immunity arrangements are temporary because u s forces are temporary
1196679 its easy with mccain hes clearly going to pursue without exceptions the bush administration line including the policy toward cuba
1196680 the democrats are kind of a mystery theyll want to loosen things and they wont want to fight with everybody like bush did
1196681 i am encouraged by our better relations and i will do everything i can to continue our path of cooperation and better relations with all nations in our hemisphere
1196682 hes been to the amazon rain forest hes been to the galapagos islands so for him the relationship with our southern neighbors is not just a series of briefings by an outside policy adviser because he needed to have a policy position on latin america
1196683 its very hard to argue youre going to pay more attention to a region youve never bothered to visit
1196684 this is an issue that is essential to national security and we welcome the supreme courts decision to review this case
1196685 by preventing us from conducting training in a realistic environment the restrictions put the lives of our sailors and marines at risk
1196686 its clear both that high intensity military sonar can injure and kill whales dolphins and other marine life and that the navy can reduce the risk of this harm by common sense safeguards without compromising our military readiness
1196687 there was a general belief that moving forward with a challenge and establishing a precedent in channeling regulation would serve the country better than leaving the challenge to the next administration
1196688 the chief of staffs office then appears to have changed its mind
1196689 today typifies the climate change schizophrenia in the bush administration on one hand government scientists are saying that global warming poses grave threats to our health and our welfare and on the other hand there are white house political hacks following the oil industrys bidding to do nothing
1196690 its going to be hotter its going to be hotter sooner in the year than it was in the past
1196691 theyre going to look back and think back about how nice the summers used to be
1196692 within 20 30 years on average the public should notice that its warmer
1196693 climate change is a serious problem that our nation needs to address but we need to address it correctly
1196694 we were told that the document should not establish a path forward or a framework for regulation but should emphasize the complexity of the challenge
1196695 to protect the interests and ensure the safety of all concerned
1196696 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1196697 if videotapes were made they were likely used for translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1196698 we knew for a while that all the interrogations and questioning was being recorded and that that was the routine
1196699 we sent a total of three teams and it was common knowledge that all the interviews with the detainees were videotaped and recorded
1196700 what were seeing is a lot of signaling going on
1196701 we view force as an option that is on the table but a last resort
1196702 while deeply troubling irans real nuclear progress has been less than the sum of its boasts
1196703 demonstrate again the dangers it poses to its neighbors and to the wider region especially israel
1196704 the threat from irans nuclear program is real and it is grave
1196705 this government is working hard to make sure that the diplomatic and economic approach to dealing with iran and trying to get the iranian government to change its policies is the strategy and is the approach that continues to dominate
1196706 at this point im comfortable that that remains the case
1196707 an intense public diplomacy campaign to explain what were offering directly we want the iranian people to see clearly how serious we are about reconciliation and helping them to develop their full potential but also whos responsible for irans isolation
1196708 no one seemed to suffer more from this peculiar disconnect
1196709 and no one seemed to care less about it than senator helms
1196710 he was a symbol of a part of our past so maybe were turning a page here
1196711 jesse was harder edged and took a lot longer to come around and im not sure how much he came around on race
1196712 hearing of his death early friday i couldnt help chuckling that it likely ruined the vacation plans of some of the big city editors he loved to tangle with
1196713 but i always thought he practiced what he preached not my views but his as far as i know he never had his hand in the public till
1196714 the president has determined that they are all enemy combatants we are not going to revisit it
1196715 for the first time in its history the united states sanctioned government officials to physically and psychologically torment u s held captives making torture the official law of the land in all but name
1196716 the icrc was granted access to terrorist detainees at guantanamo and heard their claims
1196717 the fact of the matter remains that the program was established in accordance with detailed measured guidance from the department of justice and the interrogation methods used to question detainees have been lawful safe and effective the program has yielded valuable information that has helped the united states and other countries save lives and disrupt terrorist operations
1196718 dear marvin acurian is a company that specializes in recruiting people for clinical research studies
1196719 we are currently working with a pharmaceutical company to find women between the ages of 18 70 willing to participate in research study for overactive bladder oab which is characterized by a sudden and unstoppable need to urinate
1196720 the americans are making demands that would lead to the colonization of iraq
1196721 if we cant reach a fair agreement many people think we should say goodbye u
1196722 what the u s wants is to take the current status quo and try to regulate it in a new agreement and what we want is greater respect for iraqi sovereignty
1196723 signing the agreement would mean that the iraqi government had given up its sovereignty by its own consent and that will never happen
1196724 americans will rightly ask how high gas prices have to rise before the democratic controlled congress will do something about it
1196725 president bush and john mccain are not serious about addressing gas prices
1196726 if they were they would stop offering the same old ideas meant to pad the pockets of big oil and work with democrats to reduce our dependence on oil
1196727 mccains capitulation to big oil could hurt him among independents and clinton supporters particularly in communities that depend on a clean ocean and beaches for their jobs and small businesses
1196728 bushs announcement of support today makes it clearer that senator mccain is running for bushs third term
1196729 when drivers are paying 4 for a gallon of gas and theres the perception that the economys going to hell in a handbasket voter attitudes regarding offshore drilling can change pretty quickly
1196730 we will take any necessary actions so that iran is aware of the choice it has to make to start to play its part as a full and respected member of the international community or face further isolation
1196731 i think there was a lot of questions some of you had about whether we were knit up with the europeans on iran policy before we left
1196732 i think its pretty clear that the answer is yes
1196733 the best way to look at darfur at the moment is a whole lot of different actors all of whom are trying to bid up the price of their loyalty
1196734 whoever is able to do this type of operation is going to have to be bought off more substantially darfur politics is being conducted as warlordism
1196735 we are very sad for such incidents to take place
1196736 its vital that our intelligence community has the ability to learn who the terrorists are talking to what theyre saying and what they are planning
1196737 given the legitimate threats we face providing effective intelligence collection tools with appropriate safeguards is too important to delay so i support the compromise but do so with a firm pledge that as president i will carefully monitor the program
1196738 this will be a class a beachfront property with great views from the bar and restaurant out to the ocean this really is going to be something
1196739 there is a window of opportunity and we have to make sure that the opportunity is realized
1196740 i believe passionately that african americans have a responsibility to support liberia much like jewish americans back israel
1196741 this time we will make sure that those zeros that would come knocking on the governors window will not return they are going for good
1196742 the judges said we cannot proceed so now we are working on a proposal with the united nations that would make certain documents available under certain conditions
1196743 we are very worried there could be a gradual increase in violence which could make the mission quite vulnerable
1196744 serious shortfalls in communications logistics medical evacuation and treatment and air support
1196745 will continue to be extremely vulnerable in the months ahead
1196746 i think this is the first shot across the bow in response to the icc action
1196747 there will be more of these kinds of proxy attacks
1196748 we dont have enough evidence to say it was the government
1196749 weve got lots of strands of evidence but we really dont know
1196750 the patrol lost communication with the sector headquarters almost immediately following the destruction of its high frequency radio set
1196751 reported the appearance armament and equipment of most of the attackers as being similar to that of the janjaweed they also indicated that some assailants were dressed in clothing more akin to a uniform
1196752 a weapon not normally used by irregular militias is also a new element of grave concern
1196753 deliberate large scale and sustained attack on a relatively strong peacekeeper patrol constitutes a significant escalation in the risks to the mission
1196754 by what we saw in the prelude to the election in terms of the violence and the extreme intimidation
1196755 to see the finger that is pointed at me and i will check if that finger is clean or dirty
1196756 this is a criminal move that will torpedo the march forward
1196757 they are dancing and chanting and thanking god and praying
1196758 it is maybe early to evaluate the repercussions of the icc decision but there will never never be peace in darfur without justice
1196759 this probably wont be a massive relocation because the state of the situation on the ground is pretty good the interactions with the sudanese government over the past 24 hours have been fairly good
1196760 masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part
1196761 al bashir failed to defeat the rebels so he went after the people
1196762 his alibi was counterinsurgency his intent was genocide he has mobilized the entire state apparatus including the armed forces the intelligence services the diplomatic and public information bureaucracies and the justice system
1196763 to conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction
1196764 there is a line of thinking inside the government in khartoum calling for changing the course from always saying no no no to the international community
1196765 there is a justification to talk now more than ever
1196766 it leaves the government and the next administration with a serious problem
1196767 every detainee now at guantanamo and maybe detainees held elsewhere are now going to come into court and demand a trial type proceeding where they can force our military to justify their detentions under standards normally applicable only under the routine civilian context this is undoubtedly going to produce an avalanche of burdensome litigation and more seriously erroneous releases of very dangerous people
1196768 i think that while there are still tremendous concerns about a terrorist threat the administration has not made its case that the people in guantanamo really are threats
1196769 the court might have upheld a statute like this five years ago
1196770 have made the court much more hostile and skeptical of the president and his wartime judgment than they ever had to there was incredible goodwill and deference six years ago and they squandered it
1196771 lots of people like to put on their 20 20 rearview glasses
1196772 this was not a slam dunk by the supreme court this was a deeply divided decision but theres no question it has done damage to our ability to protect the country
1196773 these are unlawful combatants they are not american citizens and i think we should pay attention to justice john robertss opinion in this decision
1196774 but it is a decision that the supreme court has made now we need to move forward as you know i always favored closing guantanamo bay and i still think we ought to do that
1196775 the courts decision is a rejection of the bush administrations attempt to create a legal black hole at guantanamo yet another failed policy supported by john mccain this is an important step toward reestablishing our credibility as a nation committed to the rule of law
1196776 this administration has repeatedly passed up opportunities to work with congress and our allies on sensible detention policies
1196777 the long term result has been to strengthen neither presidential power nor our counterterrorism policies
1196778 it does seem to reflect a willingness to change on positions to be more liberal in the primary to moving more conservative in the general election
1196779 i guess i should welcome that but it looks like to me either inexperience or incredible flip flopping
1196780 those who accomplish the most are those who dont make the perfect the enemy of the good
1196781 barack is a pragmatist in that sense he has a larger vision but oftentimes knows that we cant get there with one legislative effort when these occasions arise he is willing to accept progress even marginal gain as a step toward that vision
1196782 american voters tend to reward politicians who take clear stands
1196783 when obama takes these mushy positions it could speak to a character issue voters that dont pay a lot of attention look at one thing does the guy believe in something they may be saying the guy is afraid of his own shadow
1196784 guilt trip on the rest of us because we know hes right
1196785 youve had enough evidence that theres no doubt at least as i view the two senators who is the reformer
1196786 he starts out with the germ of an idea and doesnt follow through with any detail
1196787 managed the topic of climate change in a manner that reduced marginalized or mischaracterized climate change science made available to the general public
1196788 news releases in the areas of climate change suffered from inaccuracy factual insufficiency and scientific dilution
1196789 by a preponderance of the evidence that the claims of inappropriate political interference made by the climate change scientists and career public affairs officers were more persuasive than the arguments of the senior public affairs officials that their actions were due to the volume and poor quality of the draft news releases
1196790 we found no evidence indicating nasa blocked or interfered with the actual research activities of its climate scientists
1196791 trust was lost at least temporarily between the agency and some of its key employees and perhaps the public it serves
1196792 would not comment until hes reviewed the report and he has not yet done so yet therefore ostp has no comment at this time
1196793 do not assume that al kibar exhausted our knowledge of syrian efforts with regard to nuclear weapons
1196794 i am very comfortable certainly with al kibar and what was there and what the intent was it was the highest confidence level and nothing since the attack last september has changed our mind in fact events since the attack give us even greater confidence as to what it was
1196795 its like having a car but not enough gas to run it
1196796 u s intelligence has had a serious credibility problem on weapons of mass destruction for a decade
1196797 i think by now theyve had enough time to cover their trail
1196798 one challenge is that in the past in germany and japan the work of rebuilding took place in relative quiet
1196799 today were helping emerging democracies rebuild under fire from terrorist networks and state sponsors of terror this is a difficult and unprecedented task and were learning as we go
1196800 there were public surrenders a signing ceremony on the deck of a battleship victory parades in american cities today when the war continues after the regime has fallen the definition of success is more complicated
1196801 you are not supposed to kill people who are in custody
1196802 why should the american people be responsible for paying for rolls royce medical care for illegal aliens
1196803 whats so interesting is usually in presidential politics there is some agreement between the parties as to which issues are good for which party
1196804 what you have this time is two candidates each of whom believes they can win the argument over defense and foreign policy
1196805 john mccain is a poster child for the bush administrations failed foreign policy
1196806 over time as you leave the white house and leave the bubble youre able to take off your partisan hat and take a clear eyed look at things
1196807 from the beginning the focus was what had happened to take things so badly off course i dont know that i can say when i started the book that it would end up where it was but i felt at the end it had to be as honest and forthright as possible
1196808 what happened inside the bush white house and washingtons culture of deception
1196809 first we had to ascertain what kind of book he wanted to write
1196810 we are journalists independent minded publishers we werent interested in a book that was just a defense of the bush administration it had to pass our test of independence integrity and candor
1196811 you will name him jesus because he will save his people from their sins
1196812 kony and the lra took advantage of the breathing room given to them and appear to be terrorizing civilians again
1196813 concerned governments and u n officials cannot sit by while the lra goes on a criminal rampage committing heinous abuses against children and other people
1196814 this is just a fun way for me to say hey boys im still here
1196815 the people who bought the homes say well we love looking into your yard and seeing the horses and the cattle but we dont like the flies and we dont like the mosquitoes and when i cut my field to bale it they say we dont like the dust in the air
1196816 i respect that theyre here and spent a lot on their homes but on the other hand give me a little bit too ive been here since i was 7 years old
1196817 ive talked to my neighbors and worked things out i really just thought this would be a funny thing to do
1196818 these can come out just as easy as they went in
1196819 women and girls are raped victims are as young as five or six years old parents are forced to watch
1196820 this is not an incidental byproduct of war it is a calculated crime intended to do irreparable damage to communities
1196821 impunity is not an abstract notion it is not what will happen it is happening
1196822 census related arrests and killing have been reported including while his people were engaged in the census
1196823 the current political crisis is compounding an already deep social economic and humanitarian crisis
1196824 comes at a time when food security is deteriorating and people are becoming even more vulnerable
1196825 the people of zimbabwe deserve a free and fair election that you cannot intimidate opponents you cannot put opponents in jail
1196826 he was arrested by 10 men at the airport before his passport could be stamped
1196827 at the moment we dont know where he has been taken to we are worried
1196828 the treason charges arise from a document he authored the transition strategy while the other charge is about his inflammatory statements he made after the march 29 harmonized elections
1196829 they drive the best of car go to the best of entertainment center
1196830 there are a lot of people who are there because they love the work
1196831 substantial theological voices outside of the western world have not been present in the evening plenary sessions of the lambeth conference we are concerned with the continuing patronising attitude of the west towards the rest of the churches worldwide
1196832 tsvangirai and other party leaders were today detained again in umzingwane
1196833 he was later released and instructed to go back to bulawayo instead of proceeding with his campaign
1196834 buying votes for the mdc using food that will not be allowed here we will not tolerate that
1196835 you have a situation a very dire economy in zimbabwe just finding the next meal is an extremely major exercise for a great many people
1196836 so several million people without access to food aid health services education clean water and sanitation facilities are at risk
1196837 it is now clear that zimbabwe is now a police state
1196838 in many many ways the damage has already been done
1196839 it certainly would have been a lot easier if the u s government had taken this seriously back in 2004 back then these guys were looked upon as miscreants and cretins like they were just internet terrorists and not for real
1196840 it is just plain embarrassing that al qaeda is better at communicating its message on the internet than america
1196841 as one foreign diplomat asked a couple of years ago how has one man in a cave managed to outcommunicate the worlds greatest communication society
1196842 this is the message we have heard from him and declare to you god is light in him there is no darkness at all if we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness we lie and do not live by the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus his son purifies us from all sin
1196843 theyre giving me the opportunity so im going to take it
1196844 it was definitely part of the decision growing up with those guys and playing baseball with them
1196845 everyone you play is good and youve got to bring your a game every time you play
1196846 theyre going to give me the opportunity to pitch whether its over the weekend middle of the week or out of the bullpen ill do whatever i can do to help a amp m win
1196847 we have been warned that we will lose our house if we dont vote for
1196848 so we just have to vote its not like we want to vote
1196849 we believe they are all going to vote for zanu pf that we have made sure of
1196850 matter of deep regret that elections went ahead in these circumstances
1196851 if people are hungry they have no stake in stability
1196852 they will be ready for anything for anarchy because they have nothing to safeguard or to fight for
1196853 we are anticipating some significant increase in the numbers of people who are going to be hungry malnourished and at risk of getting sick and dying during the next months
1196854 for most poor people they dont have the option of protesting they have to cope with the situation
1196855 these attacks are preventing food from reaching afghanistans poorest most vulnerable communities with lifesaving food assistance
1196856 in some cases u n stabilization efforts could be undermined peacekeeping missions come under pressure to support government efforts to quell riots
1196857 this could easily trigger violence in slums attacks on immigrants forced movements of populations intensification of interethnic violent conflict
1196858 climate change water scarcity demographic stress are the underlying challenge
1196859 during sporadic protests over high food and fuel prices in those countries where such protests turned violent
1196860 a country like kenya will probably keep the lid on it because it has sufficient resources and they will be able to bring enough food in
1196861 if i were a politician i would want to know whats happening in nairobis slums if prices go up urban food riots have frequently unseated governments
1196862 what is of major concern is the thought that the entire emergency food system may not be able to cope
1196863 theyre not easily fixable perhaps but they are fixable in terms of increasing agricultural production in the world tackling issues like biofuels trying to get a more sensible agricultural trade regime in place
1196864 john kline has become quite the showman this election season
1196865 john kline has been in congress for six years its not as if our dwindling supply of oil is new news hes had plenty of time to do something about energy but he has chosen instead to spend that time filling his campaign coffers with big oil money more than 110 000 of it no amount of talk to an empty house chamber will change that or convince people hes now going to bring something different to the table john kline had his chance its now time for a change and steve sarvi is the person who is going to bring that change
1196866 swiss brings a strong belief in craft and technique to the creation of magic he shares his accumulated knowledge with others and believes in learning through practice and by understanding tradition
1196867 everything jamy does looks natural although you know its a trick i feel the same about truly great flash work i know its achievable but i dont know how they did it
1196868 were working in a kind of market thats full of swindlers thieves and thugs
1196869 the only protection is those holy recitations the other day i was going to be duped into selling my business for peanuts if it hadnt been for the benediction of the quran i would have gone bankrupt
1196870 i dont think they are intentionally overlooking the clear order in that verse but it is a kind of behavior that relates more to peoples culture
1196871 it will take them a long time to reverse this habit that may have been acquired as a result of psychological insecurity
1196872 we raised the subject several times during the friday prayers sermon but people insist on doing that which means that the behavior has more to do with their psychological makeup
1196873 the quran is a baraka blessing that will double the business and fend off the evil eye
1196874 the area is also a notorious couples hangout the quran is just a reminder that what they are doing is haram religiously prohibited
1196875 no one has ever asked such a question because it is taken for granted why that should be done
1196876 it makes sense that quranic recitations shouldnt just be in the background when each person is minding his own business but at the end of the day this is the wish i cant do anything about it
1196877 you cant keep it on 24 hours a day and claim youre listening this is the shortest way to lose touch with its true meaning and effect
1196878 the high rate of illiteracy would make it difficult for the majority to understand the true dimensions of many of the issues raised in these programs
1196879 its really embarrassing when the ring tone is a quranic verse followed by some of the dirtiest words users might utter in response to their callers sheer contradiction
1196880 people have really lost all sense of what could be inspired by these verses
1196881 after flirting with a girl who gave me her cell phone number i discovered that her ringback tone was a religious song that persuades muslims to observe their prayers
1196882 skip foundation and let your natural rosy glow shine through

1196888 the seeing of light that occurs in hallucinations is accompanied by profound religious and spiritual feelings

1196892 it sounded like two trains roaring past our house we leapt out of bed the kids were screaming
1196893 as it came closer and closer it just roared the noise of the last weeks wind was huge but this was massive the house shook when it hit the silence afterwards was eerie
1196894 we did not need this we have just started a massive cleanup after having 100 trees and a hayshed come down in last weeks storm we are living hour to hour it is like living in a war zone
1196895 it was scary the window was smashed and there were leaves all through the house
1196896 berita kan kalian yang buat jadi kalian saja yang klarifikasi
1196897 are they serious with this this game looks so stupid
1196898 be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them and the point is to live everything live the questions now perhaps you will then gradually without noticing it live along some distant day into the answer
1196899 i live in essex and thrive on the wrong sort of attention

1196901 i had a vision of you today in a maidens outfit
1196902 wed say oh he needs some of this and she needs some of that our mission was to help as many people as we could
1196903 yeah we had a half sister who was always jealous of us she had a different father than us and was always skulking around with one of the servant girls spinning black magic
1196904 they put a spell on you to ruin one of your romances

1196906 we conclude the medicinal marijuana identification card laws do not pose a significant impediment to specific federal objectives embodied in the u s controlled substances act the purpose of the csa is to combat recreational drug use not to regulate a states medical practices
1196907 the allegations are serious ones and the standard of proof required reflects this knowingly providing false or misleading information is a significant test
1196908 firstly what is in question is whether a debtor creditor relationship actually existed if it did then it is not unreasonable to assume that the member knew or ought to have known and should have disclosed a debt and the name of any other person who may have discharged it
1196909 secondly if a debtor creditor relationship did not exist was a gift received and was the name or the donor known or reasonably discernible or was a donation made that covered expenses in an election campaign
1196910 high public interest and the impolications for the reputation of members and the institution of parliament
1196911 well if there were fewer cows because people stopped eating them
1196912 sexuality is what society will turn its head for more than anything else
1196913 feminists should stop eating meat because here are a bunch of anecdotes about how men treat women like meat and about how pornography looks at women like meat and how meat is thought of vital to masculinity therefore it is imperative to you as a feminist who are disgusted by all pornography all erotic representations of women and masculinity in general to stop eating meat out of principle
1196914 that island was left in a wooded vegetative state for the sole idea of water infiltration and now that rain gardens are becoming more popular this is something we can do because of that foresight
1196915 we want to help preserve this area as much as possible
1196916 this is a special place and by living in it you dont want there to be any damage i think people in our neighborhood are very supportive of hartman and will do whatever it takes to help
1196917 the difficulty of this is these are plants that have to withstand extremes
1196918 because this is acting like a sponge there are a lot of air pockets in the soil so the idea is that it dries out quickly there will be times when the plants are super saturated and then if there are no rain events they will dry out quickly
1196919 thank you environmentalists for making the 2002 fire season all it could be
1196920 we would be cutting the trees we should be leaving
1196921 the united states viewed the proposed settlement as highly beneficial
1196922 the seven uncontested deane parcels conveyed to the united states in the settlement are located in the maroon bells snowmass wilderness area and comprise 65 percent of the remaining private inholdings located in the wilderness area lying within pitkin county properties in this area have a high priority for acquisition
1196923 the county joined in the litigation and protested the parties request for judicial approval of their settlement
1196924 the county contended that the parties sole motivation for obtaining the district courts endorsement of their settlement was evading the subdivision laws
1196925 over the years the rural and remote zone district and the tdr program have resulted in the protection of many thousands of acres in the backcountry areas of pitkin county adjacent to and interspersed within u s forest service lands
1196926 already had their development rights stripped off and wilderness character preserved through the tdr program
1196927 if the forest service begins carving out federal lands in the rural and remote zone district and transferring them into private ownership the entire purpose of the tdr program will be undermined and the community balance underlying the program will be upset
1196928 the property clause of the u s constitution expressly grants the power to dispose of federal property to congress and congress has vested authority to manage acquire and dispose of national forest lands to the secretary of agriculture
1196929 all the 50 million has bought is a promise in the future of water it has bought air space it will not put any water in the murray river at this time
1196930 they should not be willy nilly trying to buy water at this time there is no plan
1196931 when you speak to those who have been charged with buying the water they concede there was no plan they just bought the cheapest water they could which was buying air space in dams it did not actually buy water at this time
1196932 for the first time and after years of inaction the environment will have an entitlement as governments allocate water
1196933 we will smash your store if you dont pay us every week

1196939 if all those forests were cleared and all of the carbon in the biomass in the
1196940 the pace of the development of bioenergy markets and the resource requirements to feed them will disrupt the entire southern wood fiber market
1196941 it will be much steeper and more disruptive than that of the osb market over the last 15 years we recommend that forest products companies begin planning for the future by establishing stronger relationships with their suppliers and creating more efficient transportation lines
1196942 we were beginning to see the effects of new energy markets in the delivered prices for pulpwood chips and wood fuel in some areas in the south
1196943 we thought it was time to take a closer look using the breadth and depth of our data to determine what the competitive landscape for wood fiber might look like in 10 or 15 years

1196963 he grabbed her and pulled her inside and we all ran down the stairs it was like dead still and then within five seconds 10 seconds we were all blown away
1196964 he walked out and thats the last time i saw my boy
1196965 he seemed calm but looked like he was anxious to leave
1196966 but when girls were down there he would just stare at them from the bridge

1196980 japan is becoming more of a cleanliness and odorless society and the name kareishu fits right in with that trend of the times
1196981 more japanese men are becoming concerned about their smell and so the need for anti body odor products is growing

1196984 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terrorism against american victims
1196985 but after the pressure we applied libya will finally be held accountable for these devastating events our bill becoming law means these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve
1196986 it is a relief to say that this part of our fight is coming to an end theres still more work to be done and the families arent done fighting for the truth
1196987 there are still a lot of things that we want to know
1196988 in australia and probably globally the carbon carrying capacity of natural forests is underestimated and therefore misrepresented in economic valuations and in policy options
1196989 green carbon the role of natural forests in carbon storage
1196990 the majority of biomass carbon in natural forests resides in the woody biomass of large old trees commercial logging changes the age structure of forests so that the average age of trees is much younger
1196991 we need to make sure that emissions trading schemes do not lead to perverse outcomes
1196992 everyone is used to seeing athletes in competition or winning but we wanted to give people the chance to see the real make up of an athlete and their muscle and power
1196993 it is a great opportunity for fashion brands to get involved in something quite big and heroic
1196994 more and more we are seeing fashion brands getting involved in sports like the olympics or wimbledon or the u s open
1196995 all young people want to these clothes because they are beautiful and very fashionable even some older people like to wear them
1196996 with the olympics everyone wants to look sporty as this is the biggest event ever for us and we all want to be supportive

1197003 ill let my people and the jets handle that so im just working on getting back on the field
1197004 ill look at it marinate on it and make a decision
1197005 but it wont be any sort of earth shattering news
1197006 to see who would start the practices so based on history probably not
1197007 i cant remember missing any practices in the seven years ive been here in camp and even during the season so it was a lot different for me to be over here and just working out and not being with the guys on the field i was happy to get back out for sure
1197008 ill let my people and the jets handle that so im just working on getting back on the field
1197009 ill look at it marinate on it and make a decision
1197010 but it wont be any sort of earth shattering news
1197011 to see who would start the practices so based on history probably not
1197012 what if we had triplet girls we would name them
1197013 i dont know how you can quantify it but there is theres something to be said for experience and leadership i dont want to toot my own horn but ive proven i can do that everywhere ive been and through thick and thin needless to say
1197014 how do you quantify it i dont know but if im a gm or as a fan i see that in a player i appreciate that and i take that into consideration
1197015 wow it sounds like im making a case for myself
1197016 i know for the few years that ive been with him he has brought the clubhouse together
1197017 he is a guy that no matter what language you speak no matter where youre from you look up to him as a leader
1197018 as a player its got to be tough to be one of the best for so long and then within a couple of years people are questioning whether you have anything left in the tank
1197019 for him to overcome that to put this team on his shoulders and carry us offensively the last few weeks i think that exemplifies what kind of a toughness he has to overcome things like that
1197020 this is who i am whether im hitting 400 or 200 im going to be even keeled i think that when youre in a group and youre the older guy in the group and people look up to you you want to be consistent you want to be reliable and accountable
1197021 i dont think who you are should have anything to do with your batting average hitting 200 youre not jumping for joy but you can still do things to make the team better you can still use your knowledge to help others become better around you
1197022 i dont know where but im going to play the reason why i say i dont know is because i dont know the situation its not my decision maybe when i was young it would bother me but now you know its like whenever that day comes well sit and talk and well move forward
1197023 i dont know how you can quantify it but there is theres something to be said for experience and leadership i dont want to toot my own horn but ive proven i can do that everywhere ive been and through thick and thin needless to say
1197024 how do you quantify it i dont know but if im a gm or as a fan i see that in a player i appreciate that and i take that into consideration
1197025 wow it sounds like im making a case for myself
1197026 i know for the few years that ive been with him he has brought the clubhouse together

1197028 as a player its got to be tough to be one of the best for so long and then within a couple of years people are questioning whether you have anything left in the tank
1197029 for him to overcome that to put this team on his shoulders and carry us offensively the last few weeks i think that exemplifies what kind of a toughness he has to overcome things like that
1197030 this is who i am whether im hitting 400 or 200 im going to be even keeled i think that when youre in a group and youre the older guy in the group and people look up to you you want to be consistent you want to be reliable and accountable
1197031 i dont think who you are should have anything to do with your batting average hitting 200 youre not jumping for joy but you can still do things to make the team better you can still use your knowledge to help others become better around you
1197032 i dont know where but im going to play the reason why i say i dont know is because i dont know the situation its not my decision maybe when i was young it would bother me but now you know its like whenever that day comes well sit and talk and well move forward
1197033 all ive got is a red guitar mine isnt read though three chords and the truth
1197034 not that i have already obtained all this or have already been made perfect but i press on to take hold of that for which christ jesus took hold of me brothers i do not consider myself to have taken hold of it but one thing i do forgetting what is behind and straining towards what is ahead
1197035 uses global positioning system gps tracking satellites to provide vehicle arrival information and real time maps not just bus schedules to passengers and managers of public transit shuttles and trains
1197036 t j had a little soreness in one of his legs and so we thought it would be best to sit him out because were trying to prevent injuries
1197037 this is the time in camp where you get the pulled hamstrings and if someone like him starts to get a little sore were going to rest him and make sure it doesnt go into something thats long term
1197038 im trying to do everything i can to make the team
1197039 it was very disappointing not to get drafted but it just makes you more hungry
1197040 they had better at least go and use it after all that hard work
1197041 berbicara tarif kita akan kembali bergantung pada supply demand pasar penurunan tarif berdasarkan pada jumlah supply operator penyedia jasa internet atau provider saya yakin pelan pelan akan muncul pemain pemain baru sebagai penyedia jasa ketika supply bertambah pasti pasar lebih kompetitif tarif sudah pasti akan turun dengan sendirinya
1197042 daripada memikirkan kapan tarif internet akan turun atau kapan kapasitas bandwidth akan diperbesar lebih baik memikirkan bagaimana memperbesar penetrasi internet di tanah air
1197043 karena bila penetrasi meningkat maka secara alami tarif internet antar operator akan lebih kompetitif jadi pasar akan membentuk mekanismenya sendiri dengan alami

1197049 coach said tuesday night we needed to show a little more life and excitement and to cheer everybody on and encourage them
1197050 i guess they decided to take it a little overboard
1197051 we just didnt cover like we had been covering actually we ran the blitzes pretty good but we did not cover in the back end we werent intense enough the way weve been covering in the previous practices the offensive guys were catching the football without being contested and thats not good
1197052 they think theyre pretty good when they have a good day so i have to be careful about giving them too much sugar
1197053 its important they show just the things weve been doing up to this point not making mistakes playing real hard and finding out who can play football without some coach yelling at em to move over or line up here or do this or do that
1197054 there will be lots of scientific data taken from this

1197064 why isnt she so cute oh how cute she is hiding under the chair
1197065 for god did not call us to be impure but to live a holy life
1197066 we wonder why other countries hate us we have a game show in our country called
1197067 i am confident that cosco will not i repeat not have any indication of cancellations
1197068 the order cancellations that happened in korean shipyards do not mean anything to cosco corp i say people are panicking they think that because there have been cancellations in korean yards there
1197069 a very cute little girl grabbed my leg and asked where are my parents where are my brothers
1197070 i saw her parents and brothers were on a plane that was set to take off in three minutes
1197071 i ran quickly because i knew that every minute mattered at the same time the police tried to contact the flight attendants to get them to stop the plane when i reached the gate the plane was no longer there
1197072 were in shock theyre very responsible and organized top notch people apparently one relied on the other and this is what happened
1197073 i never gave up in my life i am surely not going to give up now
1197074 everything was going well to camp four and on summit attempt everything went wrong
1197075 we were astonished we had to move it that took of course many many hours some turned back because they did not trust it anymore
1197076 while weve been through this flat period as a number of other developed countries have particularly those with high levels of investment in the property sector things are looking better for the latter part of this year
1197077 the tax cuts coming in 1 october will feed some demand back into the economy the droughts over the drought was quite a big impact on the two quarters this year so expansion should pick up
1197078 the dollars come back somewhat so thatll be help in the export sector starting to feed through the export sector was quite a strong contributor to negative growth in the first two quarters of this year
1197079 dont go looking for your own answers outside the evidence you hear in this court
1197080 dont research it on the internet google has no part to play in your task
1197081 a portion of these gains is likely to persist into the future
1197082 after recovery from the drought growth in milksolids production of 3 percent per year is expected
1197083 building internationally competitive institutions and overcoming poverty can these two paths converge
1197084 particularly with the rain weve had recently this creates natural standing pools of water so its important that people take a look at their properties because those are a breeding ground for mosquitoes
1197085 this is the time of the summer that we see them mosquitoes and this year in particular we noticed a higher population of mosquitoes that carry west nile virus
1197086 but i will say that these goals are possible and i will say that achieving them is absolutely necessary if we want to keep america safe and prosperous in the 21st century
1197087 its rocking along june and july historically are not big months
1197088 if she showed up naked at my door with a pizza
1197089 the weight limits listed here are per ride unit and must be dispersed between the two to four riders that the vehicle accommodates
1197090 we had a competition at the georgia dome atlanta the alamo dome san antonio and stanford stadium this is one of the larger high school venues we compete at
1197091 we get to watch these great performances we do the same moves as they the corps competing do but they are a lot more advanced
1197092 its pretty much what we do but at a much higher level
1197093 i just enjoy the competition and come to see if the bluecoats can win
1197094 this is a good way to introduce him to band
1197095 ive heard great things about this and thought it would be a great idea to bring him
1197096 i cant wait to see the drum lines i love quads
1197097 at this point in time i dont know the first thing im waiting for is a meeting
1197098 thats one of many issues there is a formula that they use to come up with a per diem fee i dont know if they are following that
1197099 i lost 40 in it a couple of times i played 5 and i didnt win nothing you spend more than you win
1197100 youre playing with a pool of folks all across ohio
1197101 we hold a drawing and then the information is sent out through a statewide terminal network
1197102 you purchase a ticket and wait for a drawing theres one terminal in a retailers location
1197103 they should legalize casino gambling in ohio and quit messing around
1197104 it works well for their typical hours of operation we wanted to keep it age controlled
1197105 they must have no prior gambling offenses felonies or misdemeanors and they are required to be bonded
1197106 businesses have been happy about us bringing in another reason to stay a little longer in their establishments
1197107 we have some kids working hard but we dont have a lot of experience right now
1197108 were trying to find some people right now and were not quite sure how were going to go personnel wise and we have to get our minds made up pretty quick i guess the deadline for us to know which way were going to go is this weekend what with our first scrimmage coming up saturday
1197109 you try to do less things and make sure you do them well
1197110 thats the same if youre experienced though because you have to make sure whatever you do you do well
1197111 were not trying to throw as much at them this year
1197112 we dont have near the formations in this year that we did last year were just trying to make sure that we can execute what we have in pretty well therefore we probably wont have as much at the start of the season as we did last year
1197113 you have a good idea of who can play because even if youre walking through things you can still see who can get to the football and who cant
1197114 im sure theres always a kid or two who will emerge once the contact starts someone who really likes the contact and is going to play better than you thought they could maybe they didnt have the size or the speed you thought youd like but they make up for it by being very physical im hoping we have a couple of those surprises
1197115 whether were big enough or physical enough to compete with who were playing thats going to probably be answered down the road
1197116 im hoping we have some players who are going to step up and be very physical we do have some young kids who i think can be very good players but i just dont know some of your physicality comes with maturity and i just dont know if at their age theyre ready to do that at the varsity level they might not be ready mentally and physically
1197117 when we get pads on then well start making decisions on whos who were basically looking for our top eight or nine guys and well start filling them in from there
1197118 right now we just have to get them to play as a group
1197119 they are inexperienced theyve been around each other for a while but they havent played together on the field so they just have to get used to working with each other learning to make calls with each other and how each one of them works individually and just trying to get them to come together as a group and play together
1197120 basically we separated each group and they stay together so theyre working younger guys with older guys and things like that
1197121 so we dont have a set group right now of projected starters or anything like that were just kind of intermixing everybody and seeing who fits in the best position right now
1197122 were going to make that shift here within this week of practice and try to start saying who were looking at and start putting them together we have plenty of time to get the gelling part down hopefully
1197123 if something was to happen to those two guys thats a tremendous blow to our team theyre great leaders on the field but we have some guys who can step up and help us out but we hope we dont have to deal with that theyre good leaders for us
1197124 we really emphasized on being an athletic group up front just being able to run and not limiting our offense because we cant move up front we did a lot of footwork drills and lifting and things in the offseason to make us an athletic group
1197125 they have been very committed to what were asking them to do and doing it with a lot of enthusiasm and effort
1197126 the thing im most excited about with the players is how coachable they are
1197127 now that theyre really dressing up their technique and really polishing that because theyre so coachable im anxious to see them then carry that technique then over to playing football when we get the pads on we can see how that carryover has gone
1197128 its as difficult as you make it be in your presentation
1197129 we presented it to these kids and explained to them how it could benefit them anytime a young man knows it can benefit him and make him a better football player and a better football team they adapt to it very quickly
1197130 the community as a whole has made the transition very easy any place that is as committed to football and success as canton is for mckinley football just makes it that much easier
1197131 the fact that we have almost doubled our numbers in participation because the guys are getting it done in the classroom is exciting
1197132 they understand that it is something that is very demanding and very hard but we care deeply about them as a coaching staff theyve come together as a team and they want to be part of something good
1197133 we told our guys all along that everybody in our program is a freshman
1197134 some are 18 year old freshmen and some are 14 year old freshmen
1197135 as far as were concerned its on when johnnys ready were ready were just talking about dates to film basically it all depends on his schedule but otherwise were set it will be next year some time before next summer anyway
1197136 the intervening years have taught me that i can actually write a much better film im so excited its going to get done at last
1197137 kasper isnt a burner but he has that deceptive speed
1197138 he runs routes very well as a slot receiver hes actually harder to cover than somebody whos real fast
1197139 brad is smart and he can kind of do it all so that increases his value
1197140 wear my hall of fame ring go ahead try it on
1197141 this gives our employees some fun things to do and all of that helps to build excitement for the united way
1197142 our mission here at aultman is to improve the health of this community
1197143 we do that by learning to give and being responsible citizens
1197144 i see it this way to whom much is given much is expected
1197145 stark county rolls out the red carpet for us every year
1197146 this really is our second home we both feel like residents of stark county
1197147 we dont look at the world as being filled with different communities and cities
1197148 we choose to see it a global community that we are all a part of
1197149 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating
1197150 going by the price rise in aviation turbine fuel it is increasingly becoming difficult for airlines to survive india does not have any law in place to protect passengers who hold tickets of a company that has shut down
1197151 we are very disturbed this judgement has broken our faith in the justice system we dont want to continue with the legal proceedings theres no point in it
1197152 many people want to get their way by bypassing the law but we are not like them the judgment may not be in our favour but we made the correct decision because we know we were trying to do the right thing but it seems no one is willing to change the system
1197153 shah was on rakhis wishlist from the very beginning and she sent him several text messages asking him to be a guest on her show but the actor ignored all her smses
1197154 yes shah rukh has agreed to shoot for me i am thrilled because i always wanted him to be a guest on the rakhi sawant showz since he has been so busy with his films and other work i wasnt sure if he would agree but he did and i am very excited that he finally said yes

1197156 this plot will be used as a casting yard the issue will be resolved in few days
1197157 this land will be used to construct the platforms while the piers and pillars will be built at wadala truck terminus
1197158 we have no problems handing over the plot till the project is completed but a month ago we had received a communication stating the mmrda didnt need it
1197159 she was a lit major had all intention of becoming a journalist and had some actual talent in that direction
1197160 it is very difficult to carry out terror attacks in america so the terrorists have used an american and things from the us to send a message to them and the indian governments they want to tell the us that they continue to remain the number one target to the indian government they want to say that india will be targeted if we continue to co operate with the us
1197161 we had to recover more than rs 5 lakh since 2004 we spent a couple of lakhs but without any result finally we opted for an out of case settlement where she has agreed to pay a sum of rs 3 5 lakh
1197162 i have been fighting the case for a year now and still dont see any relief in sight
1197163 how could a nocturne or one of rodins sculptures be true
1197164 every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food
1197165 the trivial view that gods image in people is a matter of creativity
1197166 as image bearer of god people possess the possibility both to create something beautiful and to delight in it kuyper 142
1197167 can honestly see himself as a kind of earthly assistant to god carrying on the delegated work of creation making the fullness of creation fuller

1197170 the assurance of things hoped for the conviction of things not seen
1197171 god the creator of all things doth uphold direct dispose and govern all creatures actions and things from the greatest even to the least by his most wise and holy providence
1197172 exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images resembling mortal man or birds or animals or reptiles
1197173 as a matter of plain historical fact the beauties of holiness have often been matched and indeed surpassed by the beauties of unholiness
1197174 culture is not everyones road into jerusalem and for some it is a road out
1197175 it is a contradiction in terms to attempt a sinless literature of sinful man
1197176 with many such parables jesus spoke the word to them he did not speak to them without a parable
1197177 we are far more image making and image using creatures than we usually think ourselves to be
1197178 is a being who grasps and shapes reality with the aid of great images metaphors and analogies
1197179 for the first time in olympic history we will have complete global online coverage and the ioc will have its own broadcast channel and content production facilities

1197184 kids are tired and dragging coming in and thats the way its supposed to be
1197185 they have to get ready for the season its not supposed to be fun its supposed to be hard and the players need to get used to that idea which i think they have
1197186 were ready to put pads on and find out what weve got
1197187 well get them on the field and find out who should be playing this week well tweak things on offense and defense and make sure they are capable of doing what they are able to do
1197188 the kids will be real excited and well see where we stand its going to be a big measuring stick for us as coaches i think weve been making progress
1197189 the main changes to being a head coach is the administrative stuff to deal with
1197190 im very pleased with staff and how theyre coaching i havent felt any additional pressure
1197191 in terms of how they responded to wolf being the head coach the coaching staff has done a heck of a job
1197192 theyve done a really good job getting positions coached and i think were starting to develop chemistry
1197193 but i think things have been going well and the kids are getting better they have been working hard every day they are hard practicers
1197194 were working hard to get all of the wrinkles ironed out i know we cant wait for the first scrimmage saturday

1197208 you are his disciple but we are disciples of moses we know that god has spoken to moses but as for this man we do not know where he comes from
1197209 here is an astonishing thing you do not know where he comes from and yet he opened my eyes we know that god does not listen to sinners but he does listen to one who worships him and obeys his will never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind if this man were not from god he could do nothing
1197210 you were born entirely in sins and are you trying to teach us

1197222 thank you holly i agree that it is most likely that the king arranged it it just wasnt made very clear in the dialogue that this was the purpose of brandons conversation with norfolk that or i havent quite got the hang of elizabethan english yet thanks again

1197414 its the same as when i was asked a week ago i have nothing to report i will comment to you when i hear something
1197415 if i made comments every time i heard a rumour ill be talking to you every day and have to answer every question you ask lets deal with reality well let you guys know when we know something
1197416 he doesnt deserve any of that because he is not a bad guy
1197417 you hear stuff about what the other guys are doing he is out here working hard and he is ready to go
1197418 i have a pretty good idea how that article went down but you can shape the environment however you want one way or the other
1197419 ive just got to go out and do my part if it happens it happens if it dont it dont
1197420 theres just so many different things and you hear something new every day

1197422 there is nothing wrong with it thats the design of the treadmill
1197423 opened the door looked down the hallway and i couldnt see that door at all
1197424 sitting on the curb across the street wow that is the worst feeling because youre lost
1197425 another location of a fire we had within the last week relayed to to me they had the same kind of incident noticed someone had been in the property after the fire yet before it was secured
1197426 how can you do that to somebody just kicking them when theyre down thats a low individual
1197427 it wasnt like i was looking for a day off im just doing what the coaches are telling me to do
1197428 if i was hurt id be in the training room somewhere or be out working with the trainers but i feel fine i feel good
1197429 i could have gone these days had they not given me a day off i would have been out there like everybody else
1197430 wade has done this over the years i think it really has shown not just on the practice field but even on game day that everybodys a little bit livelier
1197431 its just like racing horses you cant run them every day and expect them go out there on race day and perform at their best
1197432 the same with cars you run them to a certain point then you put them in the shop and go through the diagnostics thats what im going through right now
1197433 logging resulted in more than a 40 percent reduction in long term carbon compared with unlogged forests
1197434 the reputation of this team has been damaged no question
1197435 i dont think its beyond repair and i dont think the reputation has been ruined but certainly it has taken some hits
1197436 i would like to let everybody know that i apologize for my actions
1197437 i apologize to st marys and i apologize to my teammates and to bulldog fans i made a bad decision my teammates were hurt and i just overreacted
1197438 you feel sad and sick that one of the guys youre an authority figure over and you care about got himself in trouble
1197439 you also hate the fact those guys do represent this program and this program represents this university and this university represents this state it represents anybody who claims to be a bulldog i feel sick about that
1197440 i mean theres no way you can say it hasnt been a distraction because it has been
1197441 if a guy has a first time offense i dont believe in throwing that guy under the bus to try to stave off the wolves so to speak
1197442 i dont think its fair to the guy dewberry for example i dont think i should throw dewberry off the football team ive never had a problem with darius dewberry
1197443 we will look into other ways of making sure we do a better job
1197444 i dont know if i would blame him for it with whats gone on this offseason
1197445 downtown that can be fun for a lot of guys but the team and what were able to do this season is a lot more important than going out and having fun with college students

1197447 he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
1197448 he had a couple of interceptions but not all of them were his fault he threw the ball well especially early his release is so quick he is a real winner we just have to help him and all get on the same page he has a short memory and thats what you have to have to play quarterback
1197449 we got us one there he looked very very good he has a quick release he is accurate with the deep ball and he is tall and athletic he was spinning that ball today what i loved was we put him in on a third and eight situation and he didnt flinch thats when you find out about a true freshman
1197450 what the crap bryan and jenn just drove 3 hours to help and we cant do anything they are gonna hate me
1197451 armani jeans expresses my vision of a young independent casual lifestyle with a strong and cool fashion sensibility solange epitomises this style perfectly and brings to it that swing so evident in her new single i decided
1197452 that includes people who believe that human life is precious and at the same time they must kill infidels wherever they find them
1197453 that also includes people who believe that they should take an eye for an eye and at the same time turn the other cheek
1197454 thats easy too christians primarly follow the nt so its not a contradiction
1197455 but its funny that the bible gets more peaceful while the quran got more violent something to think about
1197456 if i was in charge i would make make the constitutional amendment as suggested here
1197457 do you believe that the quran was written by allah
1197458 apologists always like to use that verse to claim the quran is a peaceful book
1197459 so this notion that he mohammad was peacefull and then changed is bull

1197498 other than have an immigration officer here every day i dont know what else i can do
1197499 of course its not our fault it was an issue of their having to verify their payroll of employees versus their independent contractors
1197500 from an industry standpoint we do see employers from time to time try to avoid having employees because it is less costly for them
1197501 youll avoid paying insurance youll avoid paying payroll tax and any benefits you pass on to them

1197602 according to neighbours mr scott is a far cry from the image of international art thieves who were originally blamed for the theft
1197603 despite living in his mothers modern semi detached house he dressed in armani suits and drove a succession of expensive cars including a balck lamborghini rolls royce and lately a silver ferrari
1197604 neighbours recall him washing the car while dressed in a silk dressing gown and slippers and also sitting on a plastic chair in his immaculately kept tiny front garden in a designer suit with a glass of white wine in one hand and a book in the other on fine days

1197665 i dont think talk radio has changed their core views look at rush limbaugh laura ingraham sean hannity michael medved mark levin and myself all center right conservatives generally supportive of the republicans
1197666 i think if you were to poll that universe of talkers you would find they would be anti mccain feingold on campaign finance anti mccain kennedy on immigration except for medved pro oil exploration in anwr and supporters of the bush tax cuts
1197667 so the hostility toward the mccain legislative record shouldnt surprise anyone
1197668 senator mccain is a great american a lousy senator and a terrible republican he has a legislative record that is not conservative in fact it is anti conservative
1197669 mccain has been an active promoter of the global warming hysteria for which he has been lauded by radical environmentalists and he is a co sponsor of a leftist scheme for energy rationing
1197670 ive been getting a lot heat from listeners for defending mccain even though i acknowledge the many disagreements ive had with him ive been getting a constant barrage from my audience its getting really heated
1197671 i admire the heck out of john mccain and disagree with him on at least half a dozen serious matters
1197672 he is a war hero he has been consistently pro life he put his campaign in hostage to the success of the surge in iraq hes been a consistent hawk on pork barrel spending and can win in november
1197673 what rankles me the most is his tendency to criticize our side first why bash us why not bash hillary clinton hes got to have some of the fire that democrats have for republicans but we dont see it
1197674 if he is the nominee hes got to fix things with the base of the party because you cant have a convention with these kinds of feelings
1197675 if hes our candidate then hillary is going to be our girl because shes more conservative than he is
1197676 i think she would be stronger on the war on terrorism
1197677 john mccain is not only bad for republicanism which he definitely is he is bad for the country

1197698 kalau dalam waktu 24 jam ada 50 orang berdoa buat kesembuhanmu maka kau akan hidup dan sebaliknya jika dalam 24 jam jumlah yang aku tetapkan belum terpenuhi itu artinya kau akan meninggal dunia

1197701 aku akan memberitahukanmu kenapa tuhan rindu memberikanmu kesempatan kedua itu karena doa istrimu yang tidak putus putus berharap akan kesembuhanmu
1197702 tuhan aku tahu kalau selama hidupnya suamiku bukanlah suami atau ayah yang baik aku tahu dia sudah mengkhianati pernikahan kami aku tahu dia tidak jujur dalam bisnisnya dan kalaupun dia memberikan sumbangan itu hanya untuk popularitas saja untuk menutupi perbuatannya yang tidak benar dihadapanmu tapi tuhan tolong pandang anak anak yang telah engkau titipkan pada kami mereka masih membutuhkan seorang ayah hamba tidak mampu membesarkan mereka seorang diri
1197703 ada beberapa yang berdoa buatmu tapi mereka tidak tulus bahkan ada yang mensyukuri penyakit yang kau derita saat ini itu semua karena selama ini kamu arogan egois dan bukanlah atasan yang baik bahkan kau tega memecat karyawan yang tidak bersalah
1197704 benar anakku kau pernah memberi bantuan bagi mereka beberapa bulan yang lalu walau aku tahu tujuanmu saat itu hanya untuk mencari popularitas saja dan untuk menarik perhatian pemerintah dan investor luar negeri

1197860 no estamos de acuerdo en que los recursos que son asignados a los partidos pol ticos para hacer propaganda sean administrados por el gobierno
1197861 que para a os no electorales el poder ejecutivo consignar en el presupuesto de la corte nacional electoral una partida equivalente al medio por mil del presupuesto consolidado de la naci n destinado exclusivamente a financiar programas partidarios de educaci n ciudadana y difusi n de documentos pol tico program ticos

1197871 un presidente ind gena de bolivia en dos a os y medio ha demostrado que sabe gobernar nacionalizando los hidrocarburos entel y otras empresas por eso es que el 10 de agosto el pueblo le dir si a la continuidad del presidente evo morales

1197873 nuevamente estamos demostrando que unidos en el poder judicial a partir de voluntades visiones compartidas y esfuerzos comunes podemos generar procesos para el engrandecimiento del servicio judicial
1197874 este proyecto que hoy se inaugura no podr a haberse materializado si no hubi ramos contado con la cooperaci n del gobierno de los estados unidos a trav s de su agencia de cooperaci n para el desarrollo internacional usaid

1197882 nesta imagem j fica dif cil distinguir as mesas olhe bem para elas e outra coisa que gostaria de dizer que este tipo de efeito totalmente contra diablo 2 pois em d2 as magias skills s o bem vivas e chocantes decidir escurecer tudo at mesmo as magias deixaria tudo cinza e sem vida totalmente contra a filosofia de diablo 2
1197883 s para deixar claro veremos muitos arco iris em diablo 3
1197884 hahaha depois do an ncio de diablo 3 um de nossos artistas pegou uma imagem do game screenshot e pintou um arco iris nela n o n o veremos uma tonelada de arco iris no game mas aquele que colocamos naquele local espec fico est de bom tamanho a cr tica que mais gostei foi uma que analisou o angulo do arco iris do game nos dizendo que estava errado e era fisicamente imposs vel
1197885 voc s decidiram mudar a dire o de arte somente depois de jogar o game em uma vers o de teste interna
1197886 basicamente sim o game estava escuro e bem dark mas quando fomos testar acabamos encontrando muitos problemas visuais os personagens e monstros ficaram confusos na tela entre outras situa es
1197887 n s n o criamos reas t o escuras assim

1197895 como o jap o tem grandes preocupa es com o meio ambiente tivemos a oportunidade de expor destaques de nossa atua o nesse tema em especial o programa fapesp de pesquisa em bioenergia bioen mostramos como na reflex o brasileira sobre a rea energ tica h uma dimens o importante de pesquisa e desenvolvimento
1197896 para a fapesp de grande import ncia uma maior intera o com o jap o um grande centro produtor de conhecimento inova o e tecnologias aplicadas
1197897 uma coopera o que vise somente a mitiga o incompleta
1197898 quando vemos linhas de evid ncia convergirem em um nico modelo significa que algo nesse sentido realmente ocorreu
1197899 a frica tem uma das maiores diversidades gen ticas no mundo mas um dos locais menos estudados ela esconde muitas hist rias sobre as quais ningu m at hoje se interessou
1197900 a proposta era trazer todos tanto brasileiros como estrangeiros para o n vel do que temos hoje na gen tica e na gen mica da cana de a car com destaque para potenciais usos no melhoramento na transforma o e nos aspectos evolutivos
1197901 o bioen realizar essa tarefa em um primeiro momento em pequena escala seq enciando mil peda os lineares do genoma da cana que tenham regi es de interesse para o programa nos pr ximos quatro anos
1197902 a partir das discuss es apresentadas no workshop ficou claro que o genoma complexo mas tamb m que existem estrat gias de diferentes lugares que v o nos ajudar a montar essa infra estrutura
1197903 ainda conhecemos muito pouco sobre o que faz a cana ser diferente de esp cies pr ximas como sorgo e arroz ainda que compartilhem muitos genes em comum
1197904 a bioenergia uma importante oportunidade para o brasil e para o mundo por atender a necessidades que v o desde a gera o de energia at as estrat gias para limitar a emiss o de gases de efeito estufa
1197905 o programa bioen foi portanto constru do sobre bases relevantes de conhecimento
1197906 o problema com o seq enciamento da cana de a car que ela tem uma estrutura cromoss mica bastante complexa as variedades mais utilizadas da planta t m uma centena de cromossomos v rios quase id nticos
1197907 com isso utilizando os aparelhos atuais somos obrigados a utilizar o que chamamos de uma profundidade maior ou o n mero de repeti es feitas para cada cromossomo isto em vez de repetir o equivalente a 20 vezes o genoma seremos obrigados a fazer cerca de 40 ou 50 vezes para ter mais confiabilidade
1197908 espero que com estrat gias como o wgs possamos ter uma grande quantidade de informa es sobre o genoma da cana de a car
1197909 acredito que conseguiremos a qualidade de informa o que procuramos combinando as estrat gias dispon veis poderemos seq enciar as extremidades de grandes regi es ou aumentar a profundidades de pequenos trechos
1197910 h cerca de 15 anos sabemos que os genomas do sorgo e da cana de a car s o muito semelhantes exceto pelo fato de que o genoma do sorgo tem apenas uma c pia de cada cromossomo e o da cana de a car tem oito a dez c pias e que por isso muito mais dif cil para estudar
1197911 esperamos que a an lise da seq ncia gen tica do sorgo sirva como um ponto de partida como um modelo para chegar a um melhor entendimento do genoma mais complexo da cana de a car
1197912 o banco de dados do sucest re ne informa es sobre o seq enciamento de cerca de 240 mil fragmentos de genes denominados ests ou etiquetas de seq ncia expressa o projeto nos deu base para montar o bioen

1197926 belongs to the party of toryism and i had hoped that most of the tories left this country in 1776
1197927 during the past ten years a nation of 120 000 000 people has been led by the republican leaders to erect an impregnable barbed wire entanglement around its borders through the instrumentality of tariffs which has isolated us from all the other human beings in all the rest of the round world
1197928 go into the home of the business man he knows what the tariff has done for him go into the home of the factory worker
1197929 my program of which i can only touch on these points is based upon this simple moral principle the welfare and the soundness of a nation depend first upon what the great mass of the people wish and need and second whether or not they are getting it
1197930 sen barack obamas people are trying to denigrate the war heros military service
1197931 retired gen wesley clark who was speaking for obama tried to marginalize john mccains military service
1197932 i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
1197933 bret michaels was important because he never tried to be he just wanted to be cool which was once the single biggest goal in my life too many of those indie bands were consumed with the misguided belief that their destiny was to recalibrate the american mind they tried to hard to seem significant
1197934 every style of music has its own philosophy of ethics heavy metals philosophy was about getting wasted as possible and walking into a room with a bimbo on both of your arms

1197936 despite the tough economic times piltel has proven to be resilient with sustained growth both in subscriber and revenue terms
1197937 bearing in mind that the markets we serve are those hardest hit by price increases we are striving to make the situation easier for our customers by continuing to offer increasingly affordable load packages
1197938 i am extremely pleased to reward the patience of our common shareholders this interim payout represents approximately 100 percent of piltels first half earnings
1197939 was in good spirits when i spoke with him a short time ago

1197946 suspending my journalistic work for an indefinite but god willing not too lengthy period
1197947 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1197948 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave
1197949 access to the senator is tightly controlled i would first express regret that your reporter was moved and i can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that race had nothing to do with it
1197950 i understand that during the political season all types of accusations and statistics are thrown around but one thing always stays constant that is the truth
1197951 ok well they can be successful so well pick them up and then push their music
1197952 i want you to go to the window open it stick your head out and yell im as mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore
1197953 likely to be the last thing that battery cage will be releasing for some time
1197954 the complete and total dissolution of the music industry and the utter lack of interest from the record buying public
1197955 i dont believe there have ever been any differences about the objectives of our policy in the central command the simple perception that there is makes it difficult for me to effectively serve americas interests there at centcom
1197956 in places with relatively quick foreclosure processes freddie said it will allow servicers as many as 300 days from the due date of the last payment to seek alternatives to foreclosure this policy applies to alabama alaska arizona arkansas california georgia hawaii maryland michigan minnesota mississippi missouri new hampshire north carolina rhode island tennessee texas virginia west virginia washington d c and wyoming freddie said the new policy doesnt apply in other states where the foreclosure process normally takes more than 300 days
1197957 we saw significant slowing in the rate of mental decline and brain atrophy among a specific group of alzheimers patients who received the drug bapineuzumab compared with patients who received the placebo
1197958 we dont have drugs that slow the progression of the disease right now and this has the potential to do that this could be valuable for people in the very early stages of alzheimers
1197959 i was uplifted by such an honor after six years of studying conflict resolution and international relations this recognition allows me to get a hands on experience of what it means to contribute to peacebuilding
1197960 despite an end to the bloody wars in central america the region continues to experience alarming increases of violence and poverty
1197961 i hope my efforts in central america can embrace at least one individual to believe that culture can be an instrument for peace rather than a cause for conflict
1197962 people whose need to belong is threatened do not necessarily mimic the first person they see they take into account aspects of the situation and act accordingly all unconsciously
1197963 conceptualized this way automatic mimicry is certainly is a useful addition to the human behavioral repertoire
1197964 i am too just like you nonconscious mimicry as an automatic behavioral response to social exclusion
1197965 the regional hospitals interest in partnering with the health center is gratifying
1197966 it speaks to the health centers unique role as the states only public academic medical center it also highlights the significant benefits of such a partnership to quality health care in the region and to the states long term economic development by attracting biomedical research funding and developing new patents technologies and partnerships with business and industry
1197967 high quality medical and dental schools are essential if we are to educate the next generation of doctors and dentists and in attracting and retaining high quality healthcare professionals in our state academic teaching hospitals are critical partners that work with the schools to provide outstanding clinical care and education and to develop through clinical research new approaches to diagnosis and treatment
1197968 this is the mid point in a process of regional consultation that has been open transparent and productive
1197969 is to go as far as possible to harmonize all viable proposals into a regional healthcare system that benefits each partner provides the highest quality healthcare and serves as an economic engine for the region and state
1197970 the general assemblys goal of the health center achieving excellence in academic medicine
1197971 wed spend a little more money to cover it but our economic system doesnt justify that
1197972 the change to the spartan fund is symbolic of the evolution of our development operation
1197973 this exciting new direction will allow us to more effectively fulfill the mission of the athletic department there will be no doubt about the purpose or identity of the spartan fund we are thankful for ralph young and his tremendous legacy on msu athletics that will never change at the same time we look forward to emergence of the spartan fund because we know how important it is to the future of this storied athletic program
1197974 the spartan fund recognizes the growth in charitable giving to the department of intercollegiate athletics
1197975 as we move forward and continue to serve our university community spartan athletics increasingly relies on the generosity of its loyal donors who provide the needed support for our student athletes through annual giving capital gifts planned gifts endowments and growing forms of financial commitments the spartan fund connects all spartans who support our quest toward future academic and athletic celebrations we are spartans we are one

1197979 just reinforces our belief in the campaign which has really struck a chord with consumers and in true calvin klein fashion sparks controversy
1197980 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1197981 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1197982 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1197983 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1197984 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
1197985 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
1197986 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
1197987 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
1197988 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
1197989 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
1197990 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
1197991 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
1197992 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
1197993 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
1197994 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
1197995 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
1197996 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
1197997 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american

1198006 i have high hopes for this innovative way to liaise with youth and for them to advise local government
1198007 when labor refuses to contest a seat they are removing competitive tension from the debate of issues in that seat and our democracy suffers
1198008 im very happy to announce that weve gotten an ice sample
1198009 we got a little bit of ice mixed in with this sample
1198010 this is surprising since an earlier thermal and evolved gas analyzer measurement of surface materials was consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate
1198011 while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1198012 i try to get the students to identify clearly why they are doing the hsc and then i give them pointers on managing their time and having balance
1198013 its important to treat their study like a fulltime job everything else fits in around it
1198014 that said students need to take regular breaks and always vary their study environment
1198015 i found there was a lot i didnt learn at school
1198016 generation y is a function of its environment they are tech savvy flexible and confident they love community relationships and build networks
1198017 thanks to all my loyal customers its good to know im appreciated
1198018 sadly enough there is a kind of an anti intellectualism among many christians spirituality is falsely pitted against intellectual comprehension as though they stood in a dichotomy such anti intellectualism cuts away at the very heart of the christian message of course there is a false intellectualism which does destroy the work of the holy spirit but it does not arise when men wrestle honestly with honest questions and then see that the bible has the answers this does not oppose true spirituality
1198019 if you cancel within 30 days of your contract expiration date we do not charge you the etf since you have in essence paid for all 24 months of service and met your obligation of the contract we will not make you pay for another month right before your contract ends then you leave and not get the money back
1198020 if you port out the cancellation will take affect immediately and you will not charged an etf that is how we handle all cancellations in house the reason the customer service agent did not say the same thing as a cancellation agent is because we handle these issues not them

1198093 i am tonight i have tickets no it feels great every victory gives you a lot of confidence i think for us it was something we were missing so to take a victory is wonderful
1198094 to have our top four teams en route to the olympic games and have such scintillating finals back here in san diego is a great sign for our tour
1198095 this type of parity is an exciting sign for not only now but the future as well

1198097 we all do have the power lets not wait for government
1198098 energy prices are not going back to the good old days
1198099 there are things that you can do individually though to save energy
1198100 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
1198101 the idea that the answer to americas energy policy is you know inflate here inflate now avoid reality hannity laughed heartily that segment yesterday looked like somebody who would be a terrific professor at the university of chicago but make no sense running for president
1198102 but you know thats not his entire energy policy do you really think that john mccains energy policy is superior
1198103 i dont think either of them really have that great a plans sic to tell you the truth
1198104 drilling now which mccain said in his saturday radio address versus dont drill at all nuclear power versus nothing
1198105 it is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power from the table

1198115 i once told a group of people at a bar that i was turned on by anal sex
1198116 when i got up to leave he ran after me and started making out with me in the street
1198117 i started to wonder whether the ad could be politically fatal for the organization
1198118 the cigarette tax was a mistake but pawlentys overall record on taxes is quite good

1198121 in fact we continue to encourage properly prepared and managed hazard reductions
1198122 it does mean however that permits will be required for lighting fires
1198123 as temperatures get warmer we also ask people to be careful when using fire
1198124 the current conditions across most of nsw mean that fires are more likely to develop into bushfires threaten life property and the environment
1198125 it is an offence to allow a fire to escape from your property and it is your responsibility to ensure that fires are not left unattended
1198126 we strongly advise residents to contact their local brigade and use their expertise to assist in carrying out safe and successful hazard reductions
1198127 fire permits are free and can be obtaianed from your local fire station or fire control centre
1198128 at the end of the day we all pay taxes and want a decent standard of education across the board the next einstein could well come from a small community and a low income family it is in our best interests as a nation to have a robust education system and i have the dedicated support of my party in that
1198129 there has been a massive drift away from public education in terms of enrolments and is a backlog of 100 million in maintenance alone for our schools
1198130 the state government talks about freedom of choice in education and supports government and non government schools but in the country we simply dont always have that choice i dont believe any child should have to leave home to get a decent education
1198131 when we get teachers here we tend to keep them just looking around this room that is obvious we do have a great lifestyle but to get people here first off we ned some kind of incentives if they are completely taken away it leaves us in a bad situation
1198132 hopefully it will not discourage people from running for council
1198133 to now need a manager to run your election campaign is just a nuisance
1198134 i honestly dont think too many people will spend more than 1000 on their election campaign though so hopefully it wont effect those people running
1198135 for those that want to spend more than that they will have an unnecessary intrusion
1198136 there are still plenty of challenges that lie ahead and i still want to contribute
1198137 i am encouraging other people to also stand for council because they can make a difference
1198138 well be using waste vegetable oil from local takeaways rsls and sporting clubs in the towns we stop in so therell be very little cost involved in refuelling
1198139 the car has a diesel engine that has been converted to run on vegetable oil and a little of our orange oil which is a lot more environmentally responsible than fossil fuels
1198140 variety is a great cause and to be able to add some eco credentials to the 2008 bash in the form of a car that uses a carbon neutral fuel will hopefully help in raising more awareness of their work
1198141 its going to be a lot of fun but unfortunately we cant stop through home on the way
1198142 but were hoping a lot of locals show up to cheer on the inverell lads as we go screaming past in a car that will smell a lot like fish and chips
1198143 well hopefully be able to bring vegi 1 through inverell some time after the bash
1198144 i have heard of a lot of sheep attacks in the area recently and it just seems to be getting worse
1198145 something really needs to be done because it will continue to happen if nobody does anything about it
1198146 it was definitely quite a large dog that attacked it it was a fully grown sheep and its stomach was completely ripped open
1198147 i went into to check on a calving cow and then i spotted it
1198148 and to make matters worse it is the third attack at the property
1198149 we have the sheep for dad to train the working dogs because we have two pups at the moment and it just isnt fair that someones dog is doing this to our animals
1198150 i have had a lot of farmers come to me because their sheep are being mauled and it is getting worse
1198151 it is not just wild dogs either and dog owners need to remember their responsibility to make sure their animal is locked up at night
1198152 it just seems to be a major problem at the moment and dog owners need to remember their responsibility is making sure their animal goes home with them and is locked up at night
1198153 some dogs may seem like they wouldnt hurt anything but owners need to be mindful of what their dogs can do
1198154 i grew up in north west queensland which is a very harsh masculine and isolated environment but i always loved pretty things
1198155 making jewellery started off as just a hobby making things for my mum and for myself i did the grown up thing and got a real job but i never stopped creating i found people actually wanted to buy the things i made and it has just taken off since
1198156 after my sales at the markets started getting bigger i had my first runway show just over a year ago and vogue australia saw my stuff and was very interested when vogue gets interested everyone else seems to take notice
1198157 a lot of my family is from inverell and my parents also live here now so it great to be able to come up here for work and catch up with everyone while showing my designs in the process
1198158 these results show a relatively inexpensive but a more co ordinated effort between different groups in the community can result in a reduction of alcohol related harm
1198159 there appears to be more community awareness and as this approach continues we hope the support of these proposals will continue to be accepted

1198192 just looking back at sehwags knock in the first innings im actually struggling for words to describe how incredible it was
1198193 to score more than 60 per cent of the runs the team made and bat through out the innings was the kind of effort the team is not going to forget
1198194 the manner in which sehwag and gambhir gave us early momentum while still protecting the opening partnership was something crucial
1198195 it was something we needed after the first test where we were outplayed and as a team felt hurt there is nothing to match the feeling of winning we always knew we had it in us but to wrap the match in four days was something special
1198196 our team showed the right kind of controlled aggression through the course of the test and we came on top

1198200 on the cost side she says banks have yet to come to terms with the disappearance of the securitization market which she believes will stay in hibernation for the next three years
1198201 in fact whitney thinks the actual declines will be worse closer to 40 because of the loss of the securitization market and the paucity of mortgage credit available
1198202 the consumers ability to refinance his way out of trouble has diminished greatly
1198203 whitneys critics and there are many among bankers and analysts contend her bearishness at this point shows she simply doesnt now how to measure the remaining downside risk
1198204 her response if she has no idea how to properly value bank stocks now its because the metrics dont work price to earnings ratios are useless when earnings are nonexistent and valuing banks on price to book ratios is just as futile those book values which reflect underlying assets and liabilities are moving targets

1198251 what your body craves for doesnt necessarily mean it is good for you

1198253 if youre already nutritionally deficient then your cravings become even more obvious
1198254 you would look for sugar and carbohydrate rich foods to keep your mood up when you reinforce the craving the body will then yearn for such foods whenever you are stressed or depressed even though youre not deficient in carbohydrates or sugar

1198295 for every person you send this to youll receive a cash reward
1198296 the pipelines from platform holly to the ellwood onshore facility currently do not have a leak detection system
1198297 if they dont have a leak detection system how do they know they are not having a leak especially with the pipelines so corroded on top of it
1198298 each year we submit the inspection results to the regulatory agencies state lands commission and state fire marshall
1198299 the regulators look for adequate wall thickness as opposed to wall loss to determine that the pipeline is safely within the maximum operating pressure if the regulators identify a defect that requires repair we make the repair
1198300 the new pipeline from our onshore facility to the all american pipeline tie in will be constructed to current standards including any leak detection systems that are required leak detection on a pipeline carrying emulsion has not proven beneficial if technology becomes available that works with emulsion we will evaluate it with the regulators

1198304 the iphone has repositioned at amp t as the premier wireless brand in the world
1198305 were all about wireless were not betting on handsets were betting on jobs
1198306 because of technology challenges in the u s the only other carrier the iphone is compatible with is t mobile
1198307 the wireless technology is so radically different that apple would have to come up with an entirely new phone in order to have a product that would work on verizon or sprints network
1198308 our position is that what comcast was doing in the particular tactics they had chosen by singling one particular application that is a serious problem and poses real risks for innovation on the internet
1198309 we do have concerns of the scope of the fccs authorization to step in and address this problem
1198310 movials open source contribution should enable application developers and operators to innovate and create a new range of services and applications exploiting unique features of mobile devices
1198311 virtuallogix is committed to providing developers the opportunity to complement the limo specification with enhanced features and security for deployment on low cost platforms
1198312 they needed someone high profile with engineering talent and certainly this guy fits the bill
1198313 the only downside is that he doesnt necessarily have any consumer products expertise
1198314 in terms of actual products hitting the street youre not going to see jhas impact before 2010
1198315 probably his biggest impact will be the level and type of engineering talent he will attract to the company over time
1198316 in a world where the effect of extreme weather events is becoming more severe and the potential impact of global warming is becoming ever more apparent the met office plays an increasingly vital role in researching and forecasting these events the new supercomputer is an important step in delivering our strategic targets

1198340 hes got incredible skill has magic in his feet and is capable of anything on a football pitch
1198341 his quality is amazing it would be great if he joined us and hed be made very welcome here
1198342 everybody wants to see good football and in fact the first rule for winning football is to make sure we play well
1198343 this team has players with great quality who can play high calibre football good quality and exciting football
1198344 opponents will try and stop us and sometimes our games will not be spectacular we must make sure we play winning football first and foremost but we have the capability to make it exciting to watch
1198345 i think we can play all together but i dont really think its important who is going to play
1198346 the important thing is that whoever is selected plays well
1198347 last season was embarrassing for us and it wasnt nice
1198348 last year was a failure we didnt perform well and we finished right down the bottom of the table
1198349 this year we have to improve and get back up the table where we should be going off last years finish it is not something to be proud of
1198350 finishing down there hurts it hurt me and the rest of the lads they feel that as much as i do
1198351 last year we had to turn it around and eventually we put a run together
1198352 it will be another tough year because every club is improving everyone is throwing money at it and getting better buying better players
1198353 we have to keep up with that if you stand still you can go backwards
1198354 the manager is very upbeat about the place everyone has admiration for him
1198355 you listen to him when he speaks he has been there and done it as a player and manager and when you have that it is good for the club
1198356 perth will soon boast some of the best sporting facilities in the world and the 2018 commonwealth games would allow us to maximise their potential
1198357 designed primarily for football the new 60 000 seat multi function sports stadium to be built at kitchener park could easily accommodate track and field events as well as host the opening and closing ceremonies
1198358 we are also building the 14 000 seat perth arena indoor stadium on wellington street and a new sate athletics centre and eight court basketball stadium at ak reserve in floreat
1198359 these state of the art facilities along with a range of existing world class venues mean perth would be well placed to host most mandatory and discretionary sports likely to feature in the commonwealth games
1198360 the victorian government spent almost 700million hosting the commonwealth games in 2006 for an economic return estimated at 1 6billion
1198361 i believe the cost to wa taxpayers would be considerably less because most of the sporting infrastructure required will already have been built whether we host the games or not
1198362 there is a realisation that as a city we would like to boost our confidence as a state and city and go after some of these key events
1198363 we are announcing this morning that a serious bid is going to be made for the commonwealth games in 2018
1198364 because there is so much overlap on the city we will be obviously integrally involved in working this up because of infrastructure needed

1198366 thats an awful lot of carbon we do not want emitted into the atmosphere professor mackay said
1198367 we need to look at forests through fresh eyes prof mackay said
1198368 the policy can no longer be blind to the green carbon thats in these natural forests he said
1198369 we need to start factoring in the carbon value of these forests when deciding what to do with them
1198370 triple whammy of factors was paving the way for a boom once interest rates were cut again
1198371 not only is the rental market super tight but population growth continues to strengthen and speculation has shifted to rate cuts mr james said

1198382 het lijkt me aardig als bedrijven zichzelf publiekelijk een doel stellen

1198396 zien dat ze niet meer aan de beurt komen daar gaan intern de grappen ook over ik ben een nieuwe n van buiten dan hebben die grappen ook iets venijnigs met het risico van uitsluiting zo werken de mechanismen in iedere grote ambtelijke organisatie
1198397 als ze alleen vrouwen benoemt en verder niets doet vergroot ze bij de politie de weerstand tegenover de minister en tegenover het constructieve overleg dat nodig is om de politieorganisatie te professionaliseren natuurlijk mag er meer diversiteit in de top komen ook bij de korpschefs maar het moeten vooral gekwalificeerde mensen met leiderschapskwaliteiten zijn
1198398 er was een groep oudere topambtenaren die iedere reorganisatie overleefde
1198399 ook in aanwezigheid van de betrokken wethouders en burgemeester cohen zouden die reorganisaties misschien niet lukken omd t die heren er nog steeds zitten zei ze fijntjes als blikken konden doden was ans ter plekke op de grond gevallen ans rietstra is dan messcherp maar ze herstelt na zon uitbarsting wel meteen de menselijke relaties ook met die topambtenaren de heren bleven nooit lang boos
1198400 zou je het leuk vinden als ik bij jullie in de korpsleiding terecht zou komen
1198401 in dat blauwe politiewereldje is het moeilijk je als vrouw te handhaven maar rietstra heeft een goede neus voor politieke en bestuurlijke verhoudingen ze weet dat dienders heel wat voor hun kiezen krijgen ans heeft daar oog voor ze is warmbloedig een mensenmens

1198480 i dont have troops i can reach for brigades i can reach to send into afghanistan until i have a reduced requirement in iraq afghanistan has been and remains an economy of force campaign which by definition means we need more forces there
1198481 we will not accept any memorandum of understanding that doesnt have specific dates to withdraw foreign forces from iraq
1198482 the terrorists who attacked us on 9 11 are still at large
1198483 afghanistan is not in trouble because of our diversion to iraq
1198484 send at least two additional combat brigades to afghanistan and use this commitment to seek greater contributions with fewer restrictions from nato allies
1198485 we need to work that out we need to have greater participation from our nato allies and we need a lot more help from our nato allies
1198486 under my chairmanship the foreign relations committee has addressed most afghanistan issues at the full committee level
1198487 i believe that this is the best way of ensuring the most comprehensive examination of the complex issues involved and of ensuring the highest level administration participation
1198488 senator obama has displayed great leadership on this issue he called nearly a year ago for the deployment of at least two additional combat brigades to afghanistan it has since become the accepted position of a wide range of u
1198489 we do think that there is some assessment ongoing as to the continued viability of fight in iraq theyre not going to abandon iraq theyre not going to write it off none of that but what they certainly may do is start to provide some of those resources that would have come to iraq to pakistan possibly afghanistan

1198508 i wanted to give someone else a sexually transmitted disease
1198509 why people have sex is extremely important but rarely studied
1198510 surprisingly many scientists assume the answer is obvious but people have different reasons for having sex some of which are rather complex
1198511 not about sport and generosity in victory or defeat but about showing the world that china is a powerful country that needs respect
1198512 if anyone tries to sabotage the olympics we will control them
1198513 we want to protect foreigners too if they are coming here they must be our friends right
1198514 this is about the communist party showing their own people that the world accepts them as legitimate rulers of china
1198515 the security style in salt lake was more of a lockdown on the olympic facilities the in and out movement
1198516 the whole city is very very deeply under scrutiny its a bit more of a big brother situation
1198517 we must give full play to the superiority of the socialist system and organize and mobilize the great masses to wage a peoples war for the protection of olympic games security
1198518 the current business level in the lead up to the olympics does fall short of our expectations
1198519 originally the government hoped the games would give tourism a great boost in beijing
1198520 that plan has been abandoned the visa situation grew stricter and people with visas running out have been driven away
1198521 the games will earn points for the communist party from the people
1198522 not about sport and generosity in victory or defeat but about showing the world that china is a powerful country that needs respect
1198523 there were three different types of officers and all were really intense
1198524 i never thought that what i was doing was wrong or political or something the chinese government would see as threatening especially because team darfur supports the olympics in beijing they havent called for a boycott like a lot of activist organizations
1198525 help promote our economic and social policies and will further help develop our human rights cause
1198526 we believe that china will change by opening the country to the scrutiny of the world through the 25 000 media who will attend the games
1198527 has really overestimated how much chinas leadership cares about its image compared to how much it wants to project the certainty of control
1198528 sailing between the shoals of anxiety and self celebration and nobody is allowed to rock the boat
1198529 i cried on the way to the airport i was absolutely miserable
1198530 it didnt occur to me that china would throw out two people who love china
1198531 the police have told us we cannot have foreign guests
1198532 i think its excessive what are they afraid of no one wants to cause trouble at the olympic games
1198533 the party is being postponed until after the olympic games my friends joke that security has become even more important for china than topping the medals table
1198534 by trying to control everything the authorities are missing the big picture
1198535 nobody will see what beijing has become in the last three years a vibrant cultural city
1198536 well the first thing is not to worry too much
1198537 i am the way the truth and the light no one comes to the father except through me
1198538 ohh i havent had it like that in a long time
1198539 campaign for who knows how long yet it seems like at least a good 80 probably more dont
1198540 if i wanted to i could go that route and be respected not for my success respected for my music and my lyrics or whatever
1198541 thats why i did the mixtape that i did i did a mixtape called teen of the south with dj scream and i did that just to step my game up a little bit on that lyrical side but i wasnt really going into no album and just full fledge trying to switch my swagger and try to get respect from the game
1198542 remembered to check it out im gratified to say that i adore this show and we can explore why together as its always meant to be
1198543 in matters of grave importance style not sincerity is the vital thing
1198544 youre so wise youre like a miniature buddha covered in hair
1198545 patently offensive and lacks any artistic literary or scientific value
1198546 my sons were greatly disturbed by viewing this material and this matter has caused many sleepless nights in our house
1198547 perhaps the book ended up in the military section because the boys hid it there or perhaps having found the book in its proper section the boys were reading it in the military section where they had told their father they would be researching military academies someone catches them smack in the middle of the fistfucking chapter and they make up the story as an alibi
1198548 a more sensitive more clinical approach to same material might be more appropriate for the library
1198549 im not sure what spence means by clinical some people say my book is pretty clinical in that it gives basic health info etc
1198550 but if by clinical spence means boringly technical i cant see who is going to write it let alone read it
1198551 any effort to reinstate the book will be met with legal action and protests from the christian community
1198552 i heard the plane above and thought gosh its awfully low and awfully early
1198553 because it was so foggy i couldnt see any smoke plumes
1198554 was conceived by slade gorton and wally walker it was timed and intended to derail the nbas vote on the pbcs request to locate to oklahoma city and rehabilitate the image of howard schultz who some hold responsible for the sonics potential departure but the nba approved relocation the team has moved and schultzs image depends on more important things

1198558 we have table dances where our entertainers stay 6 to 12 inches away at all times
1198559 any victory for the adult industry way to go but it doesnt really apply to us
1198560 her pelvis to his pelvis area and thigh for the purpose of arousing sexual excitement
1198561 a whole host of very normal conduct such as theater performance movie making photography things of that nature would be illegal under this ordinance as well
1198562 were going to be doing a review of the ordinance in light of the case and make some sort of determination to see if we can appeal it
1198563 its disgusting its another form of prostitution to me you cant tell me that they sit on their laps and thats it
1198564 now were spending a flat 200 a month while the cost savings are great the ability to connect to the conference line in one click with skype without tying up the phone lines so we can interface with customers is equally valuable
1198565 having the web interface from vapps really made that possible because we could see who was on the call mute the call and un mute it when it was time to take questions
1198566 jerry is a talented and accomplished leader whose background makes him suited for this key leadership position
1198567 jerry has experience in process improvement acquisitions market development growth and increasing profits

1198572 i dont mind if you go ass to mouth on me
1198573 yeah i know but we have no choice we have to keep moving
1198574 we dont want the government shutdown to be an issue but the fact is the democrats are so overconfident that theyre willing to talk about a ban and theyre willing to talk about raising taxes on gasoline so this is just pretty incredible
1198575 but i think that once americans realize that this drilling ban will expire unless we pass something i think there is going to be just an outcry to not vote for anything that had a ban in it
1198576 may result in serious injury or death as well as damage to the crane and other property
1198577 no cranes have failed due to this issue and affected parts have been corrected or are in the process of being corrected

1198630 putin inherited a ransacked and bewildered country with a poor and demoralized people
1198631 and he started to do what was possible a slow and gradual restoration these efforts were not noticed nor appreciated immediately in any case one is hard pressed to find examples in history when steps by one country to restore its strength were met favorably by other governments
1198632 we are proud that alexander solzhenitsyn was our compatriot and contemporary
1198633 we will remember him as a strong courageous person with a great sense of dignity his activities as a writer and public figure his entire long thorny life journey will remain for us a model of true devotion selfless service to the people motherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humaneness

1198657 i believe that marriages that have been entered into subsequent to the may 15 supreme court opinion will be recognized by the california supreme court

1198659 crude and refined product prices have risen sharply this year due to various reasons such as the rise in demand especially from china and india as well as the low spare crude producing capacity
1198660 fiji has been sheltered from global price increases until now as pricing adjustments have been deferred based on the interim governments decision to cushion the impact of these increases
1198661 unfortunately the upward movement of oil prices in the international market continued without a cooling off period
1198662 the oil industry had to forego a price review in july and after careful examination the minister for finance and national planning has decided to implement prices based on cumulative increases for the months of july and august
1198663 ntt 2 is of the view that improving the legal environment for business is a fundamental prerequisite for private sector activities to flourish in fiji this not only includes updating archaic laws and regulations but also improving services such as computerization of registries
1198664 it was noted that due to improper record keeping at the registries a number of private operations are able to avoid liabilities such as taxes which ordinary businesses incur
1198665 in addition government needs to be more accountable in the management of its finance fiscal discipline should be of paramount importance and that ntt2 resolves that the principles of fiscal responsibility should be made more binding on the government

1198740 its nice to see someone who votes right along with mitch mcconnell and gang get pitched headlong into the dumpster
1198741 this is after all the pork king of the united states senate dogged for years by allegations of corruption
1198742 in response stevens professed his innocence of course they always do
1198743 apparently republicans were right all along about the morally debilitating effects of relying for decades on a nonstop stream of federal welfare handouts
1198744 remember louisiana is the state where a sitting dem congresscritter allegedly had a 90 000 block of cash sitting in his freezer and where most of his family is already indicted for corruption and influence peddling charges so what is the commonality

1198746 department of energy makes the same recommendation mentions that gop govs crist and schwarzenegger have made similar calls
1198747 does anyone understand why obama suggesting that people keep their tires properly inflated is some sort of hilarious gaffe
1198748 mccain supporters in michigan will distribute tire gauges at obamas energy speech in lansing the rnc will also deliver gauges reading obamas energy plan to washington newsrooms
1198749 we are quite obviously in the midst of a very aggressive roll out here john mccain
1198750 it seems to me the only thing obama wants us to do is inflate tires
1198751 to single shoot on something that wont work and mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump im just not going to be a party to it

1198756 soon host some of the best sporting facilities in the world
1198757 the victorian government spent almost 700 million hosting the commonwealth games in 2006 for an economic return estimated 1 6 billion
1198758 i believe the cost to wa taxpayers would be considerably less because most of the sporting infrastructure required will already have been built whether we host the games or not
1198759 we intended for some time to make this announcement this week
1198760 its our responsibility to get out and attract these sorts of events

1198762 self ive been oh so wrong for all these years the other side of the aisle had it right and im man enough to abandon my previously cement clad position on the topic at hand
1198763 i do not believe in quotas i have not seen the details of some of these proposals but ive always opposed quotas
1198764 i do not have a firm enough grasp on the historical and relevant context of mccains remark in 1998 to give you the pushback that this question deserves
1198765 on sunday at a gathering of journalists of color in chicago obama expressed disappointment that mccain has changed his position of affirmative action
1198766 i think in the past he had been opposed to these kinds of ward connerly referenda or initiatives as divisive
1198767 obama said to a question asked from an audience of journalists

1198775 ive already had an hour and a half i mean im so overexposed im making paris hilton look like a recluse
1198776 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
1198777 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1198778 left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
1198779 if im testing a dll assembly that uses a config file to read in data when i run the tests nunit loads its own config file and all my tests fail how can i solve this
1198780 imagine theres a team working on a new release of feature a part of another team is working on a fix of a previously released version of their feature feature b while the rest of the team is working on the next version in the meanwhile a third team is required to release feature c to a new test environment for functional testing by end users
1198781 setting powershell environment for using microsoft visual studio 2008 x86 tools
1198782 as you might expect before we can start serious development we have to write specs those arent my job thats what do but developers and testers are actively involved in critiquing the specs technically my purpose in those meetings is to flag any design issues that would make the product untestable but in reality im there to provide my input on what the product should do
1198783 is it recommended to use mock objects to represent every external system that our production code interacts with
1198784 most of you believe that hurricane is a reference to well hurricanes
1198785 in reality though it has nothing to do with tropical storms it has everything to do with my love of hurricane malt liquor
1198786 you probably think im pretty nerdy with my little bowtie and everything but the truth is when i leave this studio ill be back in my dressing room getting my forty on just like every night
1198787 glens a grown man and i suppose hes free to drink as much of that stuff as he likes
1198788 but what he did was extremely unprofessional and utterly uncalled for for many of our viewers this will change the way they look at hurricane forever
1198789 oh yeah you dont get any more authentic than this
1198790 it was kind of like there was hot orange paint all over the cheesesteak
1198791 historically when a team wins a championship theres a parade down broad st
1198792 but does an arenabowl title actually count as a championship thats something were looking into
1198793 its kind of a strange situation because wed want to show the soul how appreciative we are but at the same time you know they arent exactly the eagles
1198794 personally i thought it might be nice to have a little cupcake party down at the wachovia center maybe even get the ones with rainbow jimmies
1198795 instead of a parade i thought we could get some cake some sodas maybe a bunch of balloons
1198796 thats what we did when my grandsons pop warner team won its championship
1198797 i guess i can understand not having a parade down broad st
1198798 but these guys have busted their tails to get to where they are now maybe we could have a parade down pattison or at the very least around the chickies amp petes parking lot
1198799 itd be cool if the soul won i guess but a parade should only be for when one of the myers swings by eagles camp
1198800 i went back to lehigh to clean out my locker and i got to thinking yknow about what if this baseball thing doesnt work out
1198801 and the eagles camp was only like 20 minutes away so i figured hey what the hell
1198802 we let him take a few snaps at qb but id say hes a bit raw
1198803 for one thing he was really throwing a lot of floaters
1198804 to be honest bretts ball didnt have a whole lot of zip on it and he had some accuracy issues i actually think hed be better suited for free safety or punt coverage what with his um history and all
1198805 before the renovation shed sniff other dogs butts and whatnot but she never seemed that into it
1198806 but now she really gets up in there i think its the fresh woodchips
1198807 you might think those funds should probably go to schools infrastructure food pantries things of that nature but when you see just how eager the ass licking is now you realize that it was money well spent
1198808 yosef just loves it he sniffs balls and licks butt with a gusto he really didnt have before
1198809 ive even caught him trying to eat another dogs doo doo and that
1198810 im seeing philadelphia in an entirely sorry excuse me patent attorney christopher worley who came up with the idea after reading about the bicycle coalition of greater philadelphias may initiative had similar words
1198811 and not only am i going green i get to bond with young quentin here isnt that right you little moron
1198812 its a little slower than driving down to the navy yard but its much more relaxing and rachels getting a great cardio workout to boot
1198813 this project will be at the cutting edge of incongruity with its surrounding area
1198814 fuckneighbor commons will dwarf everything else for blocks drive up prices and eventually drive out longtime residents ive been working up to this for years
1198815 figuratively crap on everyone and everything around it in ways ive previously only dreamed of
1198816 itll stick out like a sore thumb or perhaps more appropriately a big sore middle finger
1198817 i dont know what that mans thinking just plopping down a thing like that
1198818 although i guess the name of the place is kind of a hint
1198819 i was sitting on the table in s 12th st s brew ha ha just minding my own beeswax
1198820 someone had just read me and he put me on the table as he was leaving but whoops turns out i had company
1198821 i tried to chat with him but he just wouldnt say anything even though we were obviously touching
1198822 just between you and me though i think he liked it
1198823 i was a little bit relieved ill uh ill admit it
1198824 but i mean it wasnt because the paper was um gay it was just you know like getting a little warm you know
1198825 a crowd had gathered so i stopped to see what all the fuss was about and what do i see but scheper on the other side of the street getting ready to cross
1198826 i was zipping along there when right around 22nd st this this guy runs out not thirty yards in front of me
1198827 i damn near clipped him but i cant say that i feel all that bad about it i mean who ever heard of crossing the parkway
1198828 i was walking along and i looked up to see scheper running for his life basically it was either the bravest thing ive ever seen or the dumbest
1198829 i know how nuts it probably looked to people and actually i
1198830 jocelyn has basically gone through hell just because she looks awesome in a bikini
1198831 on the other hand pretty much nobody bothers me i have to tell you its been great
1198832 media inquiries for edward are fairly rare and nine times out of ten the reporter just asks about jocelyn anyway
1198833 i think hes really come to appreciate the benefits of being unappetizing
1198834 i think that at first eddie was a little resentful because its sort of like hey what about me but thanks to jocelyn i think hes learned that in his situation looking like a muppet definitely has its benefits
1198835 we began our research in 2003 and we were quite thorough in our methodology
1198836 but even we were surprised by the depth of the idiocy the intelligent tourists were outnumbered by a factor of almost 3 to 1
1198837 i dont know how many times ive almost been pushed into traffic by some bovine family waddling down the street with their duck beaks and souvenir flags
1198838 its nice to have a report that proves what ive always thought
1198839 just the other day i gave a bunch of tourists directions to what they called independent hall and they were standing right next to it
1198840 i didnt need a five year study to tell me they were morons but its still reassuring
1198841 i havent had a chance to look at it yet
1198842 but tourism is a big part of our local economy and i wouldnt want to alienate any of our guests
1198843 i felt better than i have in a long time
1198844 im really hoping this can somehow carry over into the real world
1198845 its good to see adam pitch well even if hes just sitting in his boxers on the living room couch
1198846 from what eaton told me he was totally locked in his fastball was in the upper 90s his changeup was working and his curve was really snapping itd be nice if he could do that in three dimensions
1198847 i know the fans arent happy with the way ive been pitching and i dont blame them but if they saw the way i was dealing last night i think theyd be happy to have me around next season
1198848 i was fixing breakfast and harry came down in his robe and said boy did i ever have the
1198849 i turned off the stove and sat right down because with harry everything sounds good
1198850 i was in my car even though it was reeally not a car but more like a ham saand wiiiich i was driving the saand wiich i turn and jim my roll ins is sitting next to me in an exx pooos uuuni form with the legs of the phanaaatiic i said watch this baby j roll and i began to eat the car starting with the slice of to matooo i was sitting onnnn
1198851 anybody else if they were telling me a dream like that id stop paying attention almost immediately
1198852 but with him telling it the whole thing was so exciting especially when he said
1198853 i dont know why wheels was there or why i started winnnd surrrfing through
1198854 dont add unit tests for anything you arent about to change
1198855 is not about the individual developer its about the team and the continuous maintainability of the code
1198856 blinking lights changing from red to green help a lot
1198857 james described mock objects as the situation where object a interacts with objects b and you need some way of switching out object b to create a dummy response from the calls of object a
1198858 when writing unit tests for dal components use the actual database when writing unit tests for components that use dal components mock out the dal components
1198859 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1198860 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1198861 last night the inner flame was to burn like the suns of olde neptune
1198862 yet on this fateful eve the celestial wonders were not to be
1198863 a dewdrop as they say can exalt us like the music of the sun
1198864 but sadly our dewdrop hast been snuffed like the dream of the unicorn foal
1198865 the concert would have been the circus of heaven surrounded by a thousand golden angels at play but alas there were to be no tigers no toffee apples no clowns
1198866 the good hand hast descended to grip my throat like a rosary of damnation
1198867 but i shall return to bring you the caress of the northern star i shant forget the beauty of the madmans lyre
1198868 for the glorious soothsayers of yes i would have waited til the cessation of the seventh epoch
1198869 it was touch and go in there for a while im not going to lie
1198870 but after all the argument and debate we came up with something we could truly be proud of do you like picnics
1198871 daily news editor michael days was exhausted by the process
1198872 we dont want to just throw any old poll up there because people really expect excellence from them
1198873 whats your favorite ice cream truck whats your favorite abba song you see the bar has been set very very high
1198874 the poll questions are always hard to write for sure
1198875 last week we had a meeting that lasted for six hours but it resulted in do you use a paper shredder at home so i guess i cant complain
1198876 whether theyre about hand lotion or grilled cheese i always look forward to the polls
1198877 because theres nothing like making your voice heard on an important issue
1198878 now you know what i seek marius this is my brother
1198879 well the prime evils apparently made a good evil masterplan so why couldnt one of the lesser evils be just as smart and then say how belial might be using the player in d3 to kill azmodan but as i was typing i got more ideas and this turned into quite a mess sorry about that you
1198880 la catequesis es una campa a agresiva a favor del no
1198881 no es toda la iglesia que est en campa a es un sector de la iglesia hay la de los pobres los oprimidos la que encabezaba en guayaquil monse or proa o pepe g mez izquierdo y la otra que defiende sus privilegios que siempre ha estado con los grupos privilegiados y siempre ha sido vista de esta manera
1198882 en este momento ese peque o sector de la iglesia est haciendo pol tica cosa que no me parece correcta porque cuando el sacerdote se baja a hacer pol tica va a tener que confrontar y hablando as est n cometiendo pecado est n diciendo una gran mentira dicen que esta constituci n es abortista y no lo es
1198883 pese a que cierto sector est haciendo pol tica y est diciendo mentiras en el art culo 45 se defiende la vida dice textualmente que el estado reconocer y garantizar la vida incluido el cuidado y la protecci n desde la concepci n protecci n es una palabra dura en una constituci n que es garantista que si usted no cumple puede ser sancionado por lo tanto no est n diciendo verdad
1198884 esta cuesti n es de sentido com n cree que un m todo anticonceptivo es el aborto desde cuando puede ser al aborto un m todo de planificaci n es lesivo algo traum tico doloroso esto se est poniendo como estrategia porque no tienen elementos de peso pero la educaci n gratuita hasta el tercer nivel eso no se dice
1198885 la constituci n dice que el matrimonio es la uni n entre un hombre y una mujer yo estuve en la asamblea y fue la conferencia episcopal la dijo que comprend a las uniones de hecho y no s porque ahora se sorprenden
1198886 die im zigarettenrauch enthaltenen giftstoffe reichen von kohlenmonoxyd und stickoxyden ber blaus ure ammoniak und schwefelwasserstoff bis zu teer und kadmium
1198887 jede nicht gerauchte zigarette ein gewinn f r das baby
1198888 auch die unangenehmen entzugserscheinungen die bei der mutter auftreten k nnen sind nicht zu vergleichen mit der bef rchtung dem baby durch das rauchen m glicherweise dauerhaften schaden zugef hrt zu haben
1198889 dennoch m chten wir auch raucherinnen weiterhin zu stillen raten
1198890 die ern hrung an der brust bringt f r das baby viele vorteile deshalb ist es trotz aller bedenken immer noch besser zu rauchen und zu stillen als zu rauchen und nicht zu stillen
1198891 wir h tten uns trotzdem niedergelassen dann eben nur f r privatpatienten und selbstzahler es gibt allein rund 5000 kinder mit epilepsie in hamburg
1198892 es kommen zum teil eltern mit kindern die einfach nur besorgt sind weil ihre kinder unter kopfschmerzen leiden viel tr umen oder in der entwicklung versp tet sind
1198893 gerade schwerstkranke sterbende und deren angeh rige brauchen vertraute ihnen bekannte rzte und pflegekr fte und nicht weitere experten in ihrer intimsph re
1198894 diese anforderungen sind berzogen und stehen einer fl chendeckenden umsetzung des gesetzlichen leistungsanspruches auf spezialisierte ambulante palliativversorgung deutlich entgegen
1198895 solche pflegefachkr fte gibt es gegenw rtig kaum selbst wenn die m glichkeit best nde heute mit dieser qualifizierung zu beginnen w rden mindestens drei jahre vergehen bis die fortbildung und berufserfahrung erreicht w re

1198898 at its height of diagnosis anybody showing up at a doctors office with wrist pain or hand pain was being diagnosed with carpal tunnel
1198899 while its possible that improvements in factories and offices may be behind the decrease in cases another possibility is that existing cases arent always reported
1198900 rsi carpal tunnel litigation has subsided and is no longer seen as a threat to the financial health of computer makers and most lawyers have given up on it
1198901 just as real and frequent an ailment as ever but is now being seriously underdiagnosed because workers are ever more discouraged from even so much as reporting it knowing there will be no remedy
1198902 i just back into town and i hear all this stuff and buster olney is making my team up now and genske wants to tell me who is going to pitch here
1198903 dont worry boss they cant do nothin til theyre through sparklin
1198904 a shift of the pendulum in the other way sort of a balancing were being reminded not to lose some of the pieces of music and rituals that have been part of our long roman catholic tradition
1198905 over the centuries the church has not adopted any one form of music as the way people should pray
1198906 we had a huge shift that came with the second vatican council and a call to adapt our liturgy to this modern world rather than living and worshiping in a way that was somewhat disconnected from our daily and weekly experience it was a shifting of the ground beneath many peoples feet
1198907 the church acknowledges gregorian chant as specially suited to the roman liturgy therefore other things being equal it should be given pride of place in liturgical services
1198908 if the facts dont fit the theory change the facts
1198909 dont worry boss they cant do nothin til theyre through sparklin
1198910 the governments view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases if it moves tax it if it keeps moving regulate it and if it stops moving subsidize it
1198911 if you use a computer for more than six to seven hours per day you need to take proper precautions
1198912 if you can find the associating factor of the disease thats the cheapest treatment
1198913 we educate students and try to make available anything to them that would keep them from being susceptible to carpal tunnel syndrome

1198920 no matter what size of the business all employers have health and safety obligations to ensure staff have a safe working environment a small cost to seek advice could save you thousands in the long run from claims brought against the company good health and safety practice also increases productivity which will have an impact on bottom line profitability

1198925 we want to acknowledge the family are co operating with us
1198926 the parents are at their sons bedside and we are working with them
1198927 we will provide an update on the babys medical condition should there be any changes

1198929 we are a very good steward of the resources the doctors have provided to us we recognize every day that it is their money

1198931 never mind that joshua was 7 years old and was within 3 feet of the curb or that logan was drunk and driving on the wrong side of the road
1198932 by way of affirmative defense defendant logan pleads the contributory negligence of the decedent plaintiff joshua franklin palomares beckles
1198933 in general id say contributory negligence is an insurance companys dream
1198934 after an automobile accident in new hanover county involving his daughter ashley a student at the university of north carolina at wilmington norris has become something of an expert on a legal concept known as
1198935 our insurance company is also using the contributory negligence law claim that ashley is limited in what we can recover
1198936 just four states north carolina virginia alabama and maryland still hang on to the concept of contributory negligence a relic from english common law
1198937 comparative negligence is a nightmare to apply few people agree on the percent fault they are assessed it increases lawsuits is a cash cow for lawyers and raises everyones insurance rates
1198938 if you havent noticed n c enjoys some of the lowest auto insurance rates in the country
1198939 its a pretty long and pretty dull process unless you are an actuary
1198940 we wont produce them without a protective order sealing them
1198941 we have a principled difference were not able to resolve until somebody says what the law is
1198942 we shouldnt get a 5 million fine because counsel is not available to try the case
1198943 do not agree 1 whether that insured is legally entitled to recover compensatory damages from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle or underinsured motor vehicle or 2 as to the amount of such damages
1198944 prejudgment interest up to the amount of the carriers liability limit is part of compensatory damages for which the uim carrier is liable
1198945 unless the policy of insurance provides to the contrary prejudgment interest constitutes a portion of a plaintiffs damage award
1198946 against the insurance company and in favor of the policyholder
1198947 that upon motion of the plaintiff and based upon the authority vested in this pane pursuant to this arbitration panel awards prejudgment interest on the award to be paid by defendant or any unnamed defendant responsible for paying the award
1198948 ill just spend less next month to make up for that splurge
1198949 the downside of using vistas built in voice recognition capabilities is that it favors the use of microsofts software outside of microsoft software the voice recognition features tend to be a little unreliable
1198950 we are shocked that this research indicates that the number of office injuries is on the increase due to companies not taking the right actions in investing in their staffs well being this issue needs to be addressed and companies should start assessing the risks and investing in ergonomic solutions where they are needed

1198958 generally speaking in privacy their reputation is not great most recently there was a major dispute over the lack of a privacy statement on googles main portal the link is there now but its as small as they could possibly get away with
1198959 google has consulted with us and that has been very positive but arguably the consultation could have gone wider
1198960 the staunch refusal to hear the voices of those we exploit is crucial to our domination of them
1198961 were going to shove a bunch of 30 second ads up his a on this issue over the course of the campaign
1198962 poor bob schaffer just cant stop sabotaging his own campaign
1198963 we know this is a difficult time for wadhams august 11 is the two year anniversary of george allens macaca moment and the memory alone must be causing dick to break out in hives we can only assume that bob schaffers friends on the far right will be disappointed with his campaigns sleazy comments this sort of obscenity has no place in a campaign that should be about the issues
1198964 staying positive is a disservice to the voters because differences between the candidates are never revealed
1198965 we have never had a time in this country where more of the wealth of the country transferred from the middle class of this country to one industry

1199034 in nearly every population of adult surgical patients either medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis reduces venous thromboembolism by approximately 70 if one assumes similar efficacy in pregnant women 5 of the 7 deaths from pulmonary embolism in women undergoing cesarean delivery would have been prevented if a policy of universal use of medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis for patients undergoing cesarean had been in place such a policy would reduce the mortality rate attributed causally to cesarean delivery to 0 9 100 000 or approximately 9 us deaths annually eliminating the statistical difference in deaths attributed to cesarean vs vaginal birth

1199051 this study will expand on two successful animal studies of rabicide i performed previously by the government of vietnam
1199052 in those prior studies we achieved a 25 to 30 survival rate in animals that had already developed rabies we believe this strong survival rate is a historical first achievement for any post infection rabies treatment
1199053 collaborating with cdc in designing and conducting these studies is an important step forward
1199054 if the current studies are successful we anticipate that this will be instrumental in helping our anti rabies nanoviricide towards drug approval and widespread use across the world
1199055 previous research has shown that stroke patients who were depressed did not regain function as well as other patients and they had a higher risk of dying all patients who have suffered a stroke are now screened for depression but this is not the case for patients at any stage of cancer
1199056 we know that a patients mental state affects their physical state but not enough is known about why this happens we believe that when someone is depressed they lose motivation and therefore the will to live
1199057 depression affects 25 of patients with advanced cancer but at this stage it is difficult to diagnose whilst patients with advanced cancer are clearly very ill they can still be effectively treated for depression but the first step in the treatment is the recognition that the patient is depressed

1199076 should a type designer be compensated for the hours they work
1199077 should type designers donate their vision and craft so we can profit from it
1199078 if you think about it there is time education and skill invested in the design of a font the time it took to perfect this craft could have taken several years the cost of the font designers education could of easily been in the thousands then the skill it often takes is priceless so when you pay for a font you are not just paying for the act of creating it or the product itself rather we are paying for that persons skill knowledge and a lifetime of experience as well their ability to make a living we are also making an investment in our career as designers because the work of a font designer is inexplicably tied to what we do in many ways
1199079 when we dont pay for or value what goes into a font why should anyone value what goes into making any design this is what is happening in the field of graphic design today when someone wants a logo most of the time they want a product they dont care what goes into the process they want something pretty or decorative many designers are insulted when their ideas are undervalued or their skill education and experience are undervalued so why undervalue those things that make our craft possible
1199080 what to do if you are a struggling young designer or student you want to get ahead in this crazy world of marketing design and creative thinking but you cant afford the newest latest and greatest software so what do you do usually you borrow the software from a friend or get a group of your colleagues together and scrape up the money to buy at least one licensed copy of the needed tools is this right probably not as an old grumpy former print production guy i have seen my share of work that comes across my desk that is incomplete missing files and not assembled correctly all due to lack of knowledge in the workings of programs like indesign what do we do
1199081 i realize the time and money that goes in to designing and producing programs and software and ive seen all this new technology completely change our business is the business better because of it im not sure all of the new technology does give designer much more flexibility the problem is how to they pay for it when business is down and you are depending on the next job to pay the rent somewhere in between lies the answer
1199082 maybe its different models of the software that can be changed when the designer can afford more than the full tilt program with all the bells and whistles i know of many honest young designers that would never think of pirating software i also know an equal amount who have no problem with it so does the purveyor of the software only sell the top of the line programs or does he suggest something else how do students and young designers get the knowledge they need to take advantage of all the latest in technology too often they dont and either use pirated software or lose the assignment because they dont have it its not like buying a new set of prismacolor markers to change your ideas and or make them better i understand that i didnt answer the question but maybe this may give pause to someone who is a lot smarter than me to stop and think about it
1199083 ill provide this for you if youll provide this for me
1199084 chuck i am not an advocate the piracy of programs or software under any conditions
1199085 my knowledge of all that goes into that isnt on a par with most younger guys
1199086 adobe systems contributes 5 9 million in software to educate and empower underprivileged youth
1199087 these last three articles preach the same messages i have been trying to get across to my twelfth grade graphic design students but you werent too preachy as you originally feared in fact you worded your essays so well that i would like to use them as classroom handouts so that the students would have a permanent reminder of the ideals they should strive for but of course i wouldnt do that without your permission if you would rather i didnt print the pages for the students i would at least like to require read them to read them online and prove that they have done so by either passing a quiz or filling in one of the dreaded worksheets so universally despised
1199088 i have been telling them that to be a good designer requires humility because their product must not be primarily a vehicle for their own self expression the job of the designer is to solve communication problems they must understand the client and the clients target audience and connect the two by making sure that the audience receives the clients message the less the audience is aware of the design the more effectively they connect with the client
1199089 this principle was encapsulated neatly by the great calligrapher and type designer rudolph koch
1199090 i own a printing company and also write a newsletter called printips available by subscription for printing company owners to send to their customers in the past i have written newsletters on copyright because customers of printing companies sometimes copy images from internet sites believing they are in the public domain and stressed the importance of paying for and or getting permission to use intellectual property in addition we do not provide fonts with our newsletter files as that would violate adobes rights
1199091 your comments on design without deception is very pertinent to another dilemma printers face customers who ask us to provide a font we have used when we are designing so they can use it to produce files inhouse i would like your permission to excerpt from your comments with full attribution for the printips newsletter
1199092 i especially appreciate the very lucid observation a free society is dependent on voluntary compliance with the law
1199093 i wanted to add a bit to the discussion specifically about students adobe and other software manufacturers sell student licenses at a fraction of the cost of the professional licenses and its exactly the same software in order to meet those cash strapped students halfway not to mention encourage them to buy and use that software later in their professional careers
1199094 students especially college students may also have access to computer lab facilities with legally licensed software and fonts like the ones at the university where i work there are also freeware fonts made available on the web by their designers though of course those may not be the same quality as a purchased font so for students there are some perfectly legal alternatives to piracy

1199410 they have a new baker their pan de leche has gotten delicious
1199411 back in the 70s and 80s there was a tactical response group but of course they were never kitted out to this extreme
1199412 there would have been perhaps an improvised army helmet an old type ballistic vest and a remington 870 pump action shotgun not much else
1199413 far more dangerous place than it was 20 years ago
1199414 what we are wearing is a direct reflection of society today i have seen an escalation in violence towards police and a loss of respect for law enforcement in general
1199415 we get called to public disturbances brawls sieges riots protests and demonstrations but we are fully prepared for any other high risk scenario that could possibly come our way
1199416 if its a situation like a redfern or a macquarie fields riot the last thing youre thinking about is the additional weight its never a consideration youre totally focused
1199417 if they are heading out in the full kit its based upon the risk of the threat confronting us at the time
1199418 we had significant intelligence that there were people intent on causing violence and damage
1199419 its quite cool because when you go down steep hills with mud on them you ride a snowboard thing that you stand on when you have to go across a canyon you cross on a glider
1199420 from the governments point of view there is a reasonably strong case to impose operational separation on telstra
1199421 if you look at the history of this sector in australia the reality is the fixed line network has not delivered a competitive market
1199422 theres a lot of anecdotal evidence that alternative carriers are being frustrated in getting access to the network at the moment
1199423 operational separation is the most important negotiation tool for the government to keep telstra in line in terms of access pricing
1199424 there will be a short term problem for the incumbent because they will have to go from monopolistic rents to market rents
1199425 i was wondering about freezing the cheese as well is this possible

1199430 hes great with pr and having his staff post on blog sites and jumping on the bandwagon for issues but when it comes to actually getting those issues framed and set up he hasnt done much heavy lifting
1199431 his strength is fundraising and as a face for the camera and thats probably what mccain needs right now
1199432 i have no problem with the color of barack obamas sick
1199433 hes on his way to the advance base camp abc
1199434 he couldnt make it during the night as he was completed exhausted
1199435 his feet have become swollen and his boots are now so tight on him
1199436 hes struggling he is weak but he is in good spirit
1199437 of course of course ill keep going imagine if i gave up now
1199438 it makes me extremely happy to be here this is the pride of the chinese people
1199439 although gaylord conjures up some feelings for some when you look at it from a cost perspective we are right within our guidelines
1199440 i hope they understand that for schools to be successful they need the time to plan
1199441 a person is guilty of harassment when with intent to intimidate harass annoy or harm another person
1199442 if theres no intent to produce any type of physical harm that would be a situation where the school would use their normal discipline mechanism
1199443 were doing some refinement of that to make sure the law is covered within that area
1199444 president mugabe attaches great importance to the ongoing talks between the government and opposition which is why he is not going to china for the grand opening of the olympics
1199445 the main achievement is that russia has revived its influence in the world but morally we are too far from what is needed this cannot be achieved by the state through parliamentarianism
1199446 the way it looks i dont think its really likely it will be this year
1199447 we would like to see it done before the end of the year
1199448 i dont care what the rules of criminal procedure say if the judge makes a ruling regarding giving something over then youve got to abide by that
1199449 if you dont like it take it up with the court of appeals thats fine with me
1199450 i dont know what government entity sells things on e bay and gets rid of their memory card or what is contained within the camera itself
1199451 we do need that information its digital evidence it documents not only the date of the pictures but the time of the pictures
1199452 it wasnt something that just happened after the cameras were used in the murder case
1199453 they got the funding from the city to buy new cameras and they did
1199454 they disposed of these cameras the way they felt they should dispose of them
1199455 all those photographs were downloaded printed and provided to counsel
1199456 photographically theres nothing that hasnt been given to defense counsel
1199457 as crazy as that sounds to say i wish i was still with my wife
1199458 things got out of hand in an argument over seats in the departure lounge and several people were involved in an altercation

1199470 kbrs commitment to the safety of all of its employees remains unwavering
1199471 taken the appropriate measures to correct the problem and ensure we provide the appropriate oversight of the system
1199472 i think its outrageous that kbr tried to deny that there was a problem especially when it turned out that there were dozens of u s troops reporting water related illnesses
1199473 kbr did not monitor or record the quality of water at point of use containers before april 2006 even though the contract required the company to do so

1199482 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
1199483 shiloh and z garner discover the twins clothes and support modify and stop them
1199484 if they had been planned by ivf we would hit been bright to handle it
1199485 but we hit been fortuitous never to hit had rate problems
1199486 the study vivienne came to us early as if she titled herself she has ever been viv and marcheline is to take angies mother theologist came presently after it is a kinsfolk name my grandfathers l on is a artist land name
1199487 it is a rank squander of the countrys instance and tending at the rattling time when jillions of grouping are losing their homes and their jobs
1199488 and it is a completely featherbrained artefact to opt the incoming chair of the united states
1199489 we conceive its got a aggregation of nutriment in it were having recreation and enjoying it
1199490 a rank squander of the money evangelist mccains contributors hit donated to his campaign
1199491 the fact is that the central government has been unable to extend its control outside the capital city to large parts of the country afghanistan
1199492 it validates pakistan muslim league n pml position that the current u s pakistan policy is not resulting in its intended positive outcome and thus both the united states and pakistan need to reassess their policies
1199493 pakistan u s and afghanistan need to work on a new strategy to bring peace in the region as the piecemeal approach toward the problems of extremism and terrorism has not delivered much pakistan and u s must use a holistic and comprehensive strategy with political reform and social and economic leverage to work out these problems
1199494 partys leadership considers president musharrafs policies as the major cause of domestic terrorism in the country the party believes that president bushs continuing support of president musharraf has not destabilized only that region but its hurting even the united states own long term interests in south asia
1199495 the al qaeda threat from pakistan represents a huge challenge for the united states
1199496 a huge spike in suicide bombers the red mosque events some 250 pakistani soldiers captured by about 20 militants some forts laid siege to
1199497 whats missing is action to keep pressure on the insurgents general kiyani has failed to agree to attend meetings that afghanistan pakistan and the united states have held in recent years on border problems
1199498 the u s should stop supporting president musharraf because he is a power hungry tactician
1199499 we have made some major progress in electrification of the country afghanistan we have built several thousand schools and millions of kids are now back at school in afghanistan who werent in school under the taliban
1199500 washington must understand the anthropological and psychological background of the taliban who call themselves freedom fighters against american occupation
1199501 the taliban are the product of joint venture of isi and cia and thus these two organizations must work together to deal with this problem using 98 percent rather than 80 percent soft power diminishing isi role in defeating ussr and blaming the organization for every wrong thing in afghanistan is not going to resolve the problems in that part of the world
1199502 in the west people are generally linear in their thinking and thus they are very legalistic in negotiations with their foes whereas in our part of the world we have more spiritual ways of relating and dealing with others in order to deal with the angry islamists in our part of the world america must depend less on the pentagons war plans and more on cultural specialists who understand these terrorists and their history and religion
1199503 the pakistanis rightfully think of the sharifs as traditional islamic and profoundly grounded in pakistan on the other hand most pakistanis consider president musharraf as the instruments of the bush administration willing to compromise some islamic and national interests for some personal gains
1199504 the pml and the united states have some other similar positions on several issues creating a sound foundation for their partnership both the u s and the pml believe that reconstruction and infrastructure projects are vital to bring peace to the region
1199505 it the coalition is building new schools and health clinics build roads and electricity grid because its a country with one of the least developed infrastructures in the world
1199506 the department of state needs to know that no one could agree more with secretary burns on the need of building infrastructure in fata and afghanistan than pml which has economic development as its top priority in its partys charter
1199507 i think its reasonable to assume that the afghan government and the international community can be successful in keeping the taliban at bay i didnt say defeating them militarily keeping them at bay to allow the country to develop
1199508 the interesting thing about the helicopters is that its probably not the way to go about the strategy flying over the top of your problems doesnt endear you to the people on the ground that are living every day with the taliban
1199509 pml leader nawaz sharif believes that in afghanistan we cant resolve the serious grievances of different nationalities by bombing afghanis or the taliban

1199515 democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction

1199517 today senator obama has requested that the credentials committee give florida and michigan delegates their full votes

1199602 quiero enfatizar que esta medida que tomo de retirar mi candidatura de ninguna manera implica que estoy aceptando los cargos en mi contra como ustedes comprender n ste no es momento de discutir mi caso a estos efectos mi equipo legal est trabajando con eso
1199603 si a una persona que lo acusan de un cargo le est n pidiendo que por el bien de su familia de su trabajo y de las responsabilidades que pueda tener renuncie lo mismo debe aplicar al que tiene 19 cargos aqu vemos la hipocres a de acevedo vil y su liderato
1199604 aqu lo que resulta inaudito es que el gobernador sea juez y parte en esta situaci n porque el gobernador es el presidente de ese partido y tiene 19 acusaciones y el se or camacho es elegido en primarias y tiene una sola acusaci n
1199605 esto es bien sencillo lo cort s no quita lo valiente hay una gran distinci n en los hechos y como la fiscal a federal manej una y otra investigaci n qu curioso que en esta investigaci n no hubo ning n liqueo a la prensa
1199606 son dos casos totalmente distintos estamos hablando de alegaciones contra fondos p blicos y en el caso del gobernador no hay absolutamente nada de eso aqu estamos hablando de alegaciones de extorsi n y soborno

1199790 i agree with senator obama that the bush administrations faith based initiative has been a colossal failure i hope president bushs executive orders related to the faith based initiative are repealed on the next presidents first day in office
1199791 to uphold the constitutions boundaries between religion and government faith based charities must obey much stronger safeguards senator obamas plan is a step in the right direction though i would like him to go further
