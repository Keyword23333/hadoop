2060001 we must make sure more students of color low income students and first generation college students all groups traditionally underrepresented in higher education complete some kind of post secondary training to ensure their well being and the states competitive edge

2060004 i am not sure why kelsey was even named in this suit
2060005 he was an actor who signed on to the project after the script was written

2060010 i had two meetings with the federal aviation administration and the virginia aviation board in the past 45 days
2060011 and one of the questions was is there community support for this project because theyre making a commitment of 55 million in order for us to move forward with zero dollars coming from either albemarle county or the city of charlottesville i believe that such a resolution would be very helpful
2060012 if our application has to be deferred for any reason we lose the ability to be considered and we have to be reconsidered at a later date

2060015 for the government to claim that the cross is a secular symbol is deeply offensive and betrays a poor understanding of religion and our constitution
2060016 in upholding the display of roadside crosses on public land throughout the state of utah the district court embraced the states characterization of the cross the clearest and most universally recognized marker of christianity as nothing more than a secular symbol of death
2060017 this conclusion is historically inaccurate blind to contemporary realities and offensive to believers and nonbelievers alike
2060018 if i never win an olympic medal that was my olympic medal
2060019 this goes alongside everything i have ever done in sport there have only ever been 29 flag bearers for britain and they have been some very illustrious names

2060041 its almost illegal how much fun were having on stage to be perfectly honest
2060042 its incredible everyone just loves each other and were truly like a tribe on and off the stage and we just go out there and have a blast and run out in the audience and throw our hair in peoples faces
2060043 the ultimate freedom to stand there and have no clothes on and be your true self
2060044 if there was any place to get naked it would certainly be in central park doing hair
2060045 so if i had the opportunity to i probably would the show is written so that claude is confused hes certainly not as free as everyone else is it would be wrong for him to get naked
2060046 i learned a lot about my role in spring awakening actually through doing hair because hair is so open and free with your body and lots of upbeat songs and lots of audience participation and spring awakening is so restricted and buttoned up and knickers and coats
2060047 this show has taught me so much about letting go and living moment to moment and enjoying where youre at when youre there and im really grateful for that
2060048 its really really really insane something is in the climate or the stars are aligning or something because its like all of this stuff from the late 60s keeps popping back up
2060049 hes talented and there he is working his butt off you know just so on it willing to try anything willing to do it again willing to rehearse more
2060050 never a moment of attitude from him about anything its just like kind of a deep place of something that hes working from a deep resource of energy and interest and its great because when you have someone like that it just spreads in the company
2060051 he loved the whole thing he had a blast his son was up on stage dancing with us after it was over it was really really fun
2060052 blog about efforts merits of making election day a national holiday
2060053 of course were incredibly pleased delighted would probably be a better adjective that nintendo approached us but its not an exclusive relationship
2060054 i cant get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology but as you might imagine of course there is more interest out there
2060055 with six degrees of freedom you can basically make any movement at all and be able to track that in combination with the sensor bar and other sensors included in the wii remote add the gyroscope capability and you have the ability to work in all three dimensions of space 2

2060057 i wanted consumers to see this in hopes that they think twice about the brands they support that they ask questions before they buy where was it made who made it how much were they paid
2060058 you heard the duck was good good i lived that shit last weekend brah good is a huge understatement this shit is the motherfuckin white knight lets put this shit in sat format so you can understand michael jordan is to basketball as japonais is to duck wooh i just got goosebumps i gotta take a shower now

2060060 we wanted to take a trip to a city we hadnt been to before charlottesville has a lot of similarities to ithaca they share so much of what we share
2060061 they did a really good job of clustering activity and traffic generators in downtown where they werent spread out
2060062 they have an indoor skating rink first run movie complex a childrens museum a convention hotel and a 3 500 seat indoor outdoor amphitheatre in conjunction with restaurants and retail it provides a real sense of place we do that to some extent but havent been as successful
2060063 the other thing that relates to campus is that they had a free shuttle bus that went between downtown and the university on a regular basis it went most hours of the day and night and was free to everybody it was one of the most important ways to connect the two
2060064 i think thats true of madison wisc burlington vt cities that have big universities in smaller towns have similar issues
2060065 certainly there are comparable issues in terms of transportation people moving daily into a smaller city looking for parking a lot of staff looking for transportation housing issues are likely to be similar because students put pressure on the housing market there are also issues regarding the universitys tax exemption
2060066 it really builds on the stuff weve done in the past
2060067 ive seen some consultants refer to burlington but burlington and ithaca are very different burlington is the states biggest and best city
2060068 you dont wholesale take something that was done in one place and apply it to another you want to look at the dynamics that are at work and see if there are lessons that could be applied
2060069 you have to deal with the problems in front of you in the context of where they exist
2060070 cities derive powers from of the state department thats true in every state
2060071 you go as far as you can in terms of comparison but you dont want to stretch it to a point of unbelievability
2060072 there are certain common characteristics among every urban place but the differences are what make it interesting
2060073 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other that doesnt mean it hasnt crossed my mind or andys or stewarts

2060076 it was all for show if mr hamdan does not go home in december
2060077 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2060078 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
2060079 the decision showed what the jury thought hamdan was worth
2060080 there is a perception that trying people in front of the military was going to be a rubber stamp process
2060081 this shows they are conscientious following instructions and are making rational decisions
2060082 the government attempted to inflame the emotions of the panel
2060083 its true there are work opportunities in yemen but not at the level i needed after i got married and not to the level of ambitions that i had in my future
2060084 i personally present my apologies to them if anything that i did has caused them pain
2060085 you have found him guilty of offenses that have made our world extremely unsafe and dangerous
2060086 the government asks you to deliver a sentence that will absolutely keep our society safe from him
2060087 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan
2060088 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible team on the field mike tannenbaum and his football administration staff did a great job of navigating this complex process i am excited about welcoming brett deanna and their family to the jets organization
2060089 we were just monitoring the situation for lack of a better word
2060090 when the opportunity presented itself it was something we had to take a real long look at for a long time i just didnt think this was going to come to fruition it just heated up recently
2060091 the only part of the process we can control is preparation
2060092 we had a lot of great preparation when the opportunity presented itself we were ready to roll and we rolled quick
2060093 i just have all the respect in the world for chad as a person and a player he gave his heart and soul to this organization for a long long time i appreciate everything hes done

2060099 if youre not an expert you probably shouldnt be online doing financial transactions
2060100 i am very worried about anybody using windows and banking online
2060101 it is likely they are looking for the larger accounts
2060102 you may not see any activity on an account for months
2060103 they just dont have the time to go through it all
2060104 the relationships are not as good as they need to be to have effective action taken
2060105 the people in law enforcement tell me that to get anything done they have to go through diplomatic channels
2060106 there has to be political pressure brought to bear it has to be a priority
2060107 we think there might be a better chance of getting these guys because of who they have infected

2060113 we will release rafinha for the olympic games if the brazilian federation clarifies at short notice the basic conditions for his participation
2060114 we are pleased with the decision because we have worked closely with the clubs in this legal matter
2060115 it was always our opinion that under fifa regulations we were not committed to allowing our players to go freely
2060116 fifa failed to realise the legal implications of this decision early and the preparation of the clubs ahead of the new season has been affected
2060117 its not just a new face we need its new faces
2060118 my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the premier league season
2060119 we cant hide the fact that we need new players everybody knows it we have to get five or six players in before the season starts

2060132 we appreciate the tremendous passion shown by our fans we like them always will see brett favre as a green bay packer and our respect for him never will change moving forward we are dedicated to delivering a successful 2008 season for all packers fans
2060133 obviously its in everyones best interest to do it quickly rather than later were working on it

2060149 with the passing of oliver jackson we have lost one of our legends
2060150 coach jackson was one of the most beloved and revered figures in our universitys history because of his strong faith his care for his student athletes and his love of abilene christian
2060151 he was one of the true giants in track and field coaching circles and it was his coaching that helped bobby morrow achieve immortality at the 1956 olympic games in melbourne australia
2060152 we will all miss coach jackson but acu will continue to benefit from what he helped build for generations to come
2060153 we required more of the athletes academically and socially as well as athletically we were trying to create a program that would produce athletes scholars and good leaders in the community and the church
2060154 three gold medals would not have been possible he is the greatest track coach in the world
2060155 ive received a lot of high honors in my life but this is the greatest inducting oliver jackson into the hall of fame weve traveled many miles together weve shared wins and weve also shared some losses he wasnt only a coach but a friend he was concerned with how you participated on the track but he was more concerned with how you conducted yourself off the track
2060156 people recognize him as a great coach for coaching bobby morrow
2060157 but where i thought oliver jackson was outstanding was in his ability to take athletes of lesser ability and turn them into great runners

2060230 oh youre just giving in you have to stand your ground
2060231 i think theyve been prepared very very well rehearsals have been going very strong and the final touches have been put on the show the last couple of days now were just getting them to get that automaticity going and getting them to perform and have a great time doing it
2060232 to have the performance of a lifetime thats what its all about
2060233 im the one that taps us off the field and before i know it suddenly our drum majors pointing at me to tap off the field and my first reaction is i dont want to i wanted to stay on that field forever knowing that it was my last show i didnt want it to end
2060234 its just my family when the 2005 season came along i was trying to figure out where i was going to march and a couple of my friends convinced me to audition elsewhere and before the camp even got there i was like this is wrong i have to go back to pioneer its my home i couldnt even imagine being anywhere else and im just so thankful im aging out here
2060235 i dont think its hit me yet it kind of hit me after the run through this morning the horn line plays the year of the dragon and the age outs stand in the center and they play that for us its very beautiful and very nice thats why i was having a little teary moment
2060236 it started out when i was 12 i was actually raised around the mandarins by my father who brought me to practices and i loved how the guard was maybe it was the pretty flags or something i really wanted to do it and when i got a chance to it was like this is so cool this is awesome i just wanted to be around what my father was around but now i appreciate what being with the mandarins has taught me and how its helped me grow up throughout my nine years
2060237 ive been thinking about it for the last week or so especially just trying to take in the little things
2060238 when i started marching band in high school i never thought that it would become such a huge part of my life as it is now
2060239 now im a music education major i teach marching band at high schools and i plan on teaching marching band and drum corps for the rest of my life so its definitely been a very big experience for me and i hope to stay in the activity and with this organization in particular for as long as i possibly can
2060240 i played one game with the caps and four or five in the minors and i stuck around as kind of an extra guy through the playoffs
2060241 i was pretty shocked i guess i was fairly confident but i dont know if i was supposed to be the guy who was already playing in the nhl out of that draft i was the third round pick not a first round pick and there wasnt a whole lot of hope on me maybe for the future there was but to be able to get a chance at that early of an age for myself i was a little surprised that they thought i was at that level but it was exciting obviously
2060242 my brother is a year older he played hockey and he went up there to play hockey and i followed him along to play so i moved there lived there for three years and then went back to play junior hockey in portland oregon
2060243 salt lake city isnt a great hockey place its not bad when youre little at the time there were some good players there but as you get older the competition kind of dies down in salt lake city and in the states we played colorado and california teams too we had to get where there was better competition to try to compete and improve
2060244 i had my parents there and i had a lot of relatives in edmonton
2060245 i had relatives in vancouver that went to edmonton to watch the game because it was the first time i got out in that area i happened to score there and it was kind of a nice place to score your first goal i remember it was kind of a two on one and instead of passing across i just shot it and it went five hole it was against billy ranford in edmonton and it was just exciting
2060246 that was obviously one of the more exciting nights for myself
2060247 all of a sudden you get a hat trick you dont expect it my parents drove 12 hours from lethbridge alberta to winnipeg to be at the game i got a hat trick and we won the game so that was a great night
2060248 i like to be out there at the end of games or in overtime early in my career i had the opportunity to play with kelly miller and dale hunter and those guys were known for their heroics too so i just kind of played hard with them you play with guys like that in overtime and theyre geared up and theyre ready and it makes it easy
2060249 he was born around 11 in the morning and my wife was in labor all night
2060250 so basically i just went home had a shower came to the rink and played the game it was exciting i seem to have luck when weve had a baby i had a goal there and i had an assist when my daughter was born and then actually november 18 i ended up getting three goals unfortunately the team lost it wasnt great luck but i had three goals and it was my daughters third birthday so i dont know its kind of weird
2060251 i remember actually going to the rink and having to shake my head a couple of times to keep awake when i was driving to the rink
2060252 but you get to the rink and you can do that one night just sucking it up it was a big game and that made it easy obviously we were going for first place and you didnt want to let your team down if youre going to play youve got to be ready to play 100 percent luckily adrenaline carried me through
2060253 even when im on a scoring line im going to help create more chances by still checking the other team still forechecking hard
2060254 i think if im playing with adam oates obviously you have to be ready to get some more shots because youre going to get the puck a lot more than youre going to get with any center in the league
2060255 when you play with jeff halpern you come and youre going to wear the other team down and hes going to be right there with you battling and youre going to create your chances driving it to the net and stuffing it out of the corners i try to stay the same with whomever im playing with i dont think anybody can change their game you are who you are and i like to think i can help out a little bit on whichever line im on
2060256 its unbelievable playing with ulfie if we can get the puck down there ill give it to him and hell hold the guy for a while well give and go or well try to do little picks sometimes its tiring for us so its even more tiring for the defense we come to the bench and were saying whoa that was a tough one but you know the defense is twice as tired if you dont score on a particular shift hopefully it wears them out by the third period and we can create some scoring chances from that
2060257 that would be huge for myself as far as a goal that every kid dreams of when he is growing up
2060258 its going to be the best players in the world playing in the town that i grew up in who would have ever thought that chance would come around i dont know that ill be on the team i dont know what theyre looking at but im hoping that i can put something together for myself and at least get a good look at it for next year
2060259 its on a lake not a huge lake but it has walleye fishing and northern pike we go there about two months of the summer hang out and relax i have a little gym there so i dont have to go into town to work out i work out right there and take the kids fishing in the afternoon
2060260 i remember playing with those two guys and it was so easy for myself to come to the rink and be ready every night because they were
2060261 i didnt have to worry about my linemates all i had to worry about was not letting them down because dale hunter and kelly miller didnt have a bad game as a young kid i thought that was amazing for them to be able to play a thousand hockey games and play every one as hard as they did to their top level every night thats one thing i wanted to try to do myself i thought hey if they can do it i want to come every night and learn from them

2060300 the sacramento da should present to the grand jury its findings related to the recent deaths of children in foster care in this county additionally the countys outside consultant review process should make recommendations as to how to strengthen the state foster care system we need to take a comprehensive look at how our children are being cared for including funding gaps practice and oversight issues and level of staffing to ensure the safety and well being of kids in foster care these are our children and we have to look out for their best interests
2060301 if i pay my kids to do their homework i am saying you will get this if you do your homework but i am also saying homework is not likely to have intrinsic rewards
2060302 crime and public safety is a community issue not just the police or the fire department or any of the rest of the emergency services

2060305 my dad was also a racer and so i was dragged to motorbike racing since i was a nipper
2060306 i rode bikes from i was no age and did my test as soon as i could when i turned 17 my first bike was a gsxr 400 suzuki
2060307 for me working with a motorbike team was a dream job but i didnt think it was a possibility and so i studied to be a fitness instructor which i then worked at for two years
2060308 i was thrilled and gave up my job as a fitness instructor without a second thought
2060309 i started at the bottom as a tyre technician and just learned on the job travelling the country as part of a motorbike racing team has always been my dream job and i couldnt believe that i was living that dream
2060310 it was very exciting joining the team especially as guy was a member we have always got on well and it was really quite nice to be working with him and going to all his races as a professional in my own right
2060311 when working on a bike for a race you just have to have a procedure which has to be followed very carefully and very slowly to ensure everything is tightened and there are no mistakes
2060312 i am pretty confident in what i do and i guess that helps when i see guy or the other team members racing
2060313 you just have to put the risks to the back of your mind i get a real buzz from watching the races and being part of it and you couldnt do it if you spent your time worrying about the danger
2060314 when i am introduced to someone for the first time and i tell them what i do the most common reaction is that they laugh and dont believe me
2060315 then they are fascinated especially because i am a woman i know it probably sounds cheesy but motorbike racing is my life and to get paid to do something you love is pretty special
2060316 chinas ruling regime might be thinking that it got more than it bargained for when it won the right to host the games it seems not fully to understand what happens when you invite the whole world into your country it clearly wants the worlds respect but doesnt quite get how that respect is earned

2060323 he was getting a lot of the blame for the persian gulf mystery illness
2060324 weapon of mass destruction anthrax letters through the u s mail system
2060325 if there is a smoking gun its that the microbial forensics narrowed the batch of anthrax that contaminated and killed to that which was created and maintained by dr ivins at his army lab at fort detrick in frederick md
2060326 so they have a one for one match the probability of it not being from his lab is nil and i asked is this an experimental type of dna science and they said no its certainly cutting edge but they know beyond any reasonable doubt that it came from his lab
2060327 the anthrax that hurt people in hamilton the same anthrax that was in his lab a one for one match
2060328 right before the anthrax mailings he spent 31 hours in that suite and could not explain what he was doing
2060329 these were off hours like on sundays and after hours and he was very distressed and he even said it himself that he was paranoid and delusional at times and that he was getting a lot of the blame for the persian gulf mystery illness
2060330 nbc had done a freedom of information request and ivins in an e mail wrote someone saying how angry he was that theyre blaming him
2060331 tell matsumoto to kiss my ass weve got better things to do than shine his shoes and pee on command hes gotten everything from me he will get
2060332 that kind of falls into the area of motive i would think
2060333 hes delusional hes under some psychiatric care self described paranoid and delusional
2060334 this guy had himself access to the anthrax it really is frightening that he had proximity at all to it to even being in the building
2060335 trace quantities of anthrax spores were found to persist in those affected u s postal facilities nearly two years after the attacks despite repeated efforts to eliminate those spores using chlorine dioxide gas and other remediation techniques
2060336 taken together it is reasonable to believe that anthrax spores from the mailings may still persist in trace amounts inside the home or vehicle of the person who mailed them even six years after the crime

2060338 people consistently tell us that our tanks tales and tastings sessions are the best brewery tour theyve ever done

2060361 all i can tell you is that an administrative action was taken against sergeant kelt and that administration that administrative action was a negative action however the finding was that he had an otherwise stellar career as a soldier and as a recruiter and he was given additional responsibilities as a recruiting station commander which he continues to do so today just because someone has done something wrong doesnt mean that they get the death penalty
2060362 well theres a difference between the death penalty and a promotion he was actually promoted after this and came to be the commander of another recruiting station
2060363 im not allowed to tell you im sorry thats covered under army regulations and department of defense regulations so i cannot discuss administrative actions taken against a recruiter

2060375 la existencia aqu es dura pero estamos acostumbrados es parte de nuestra cultura a mi no me gusta estar en los campamentos de refugiados de argelia ni en las zonas ocupadas por marruecos vivir libre a pesar de las dificultades es lo mejor

2060377 los restos del lucrativo negocio de las armas se encuentran por todas partes y lamentablemente muchos de los pa ses con responsabilidades hist ricas que pretenden mostrarse como mediadores neutrales se ven directamente involucrados en el desproporcionado rearme del ej rcito ocupante

2060379 al pueblo saharaui no lo ha organizado ni las agencias de ayuda humanitaria de las naciones unidas ni ning n gobierno u ong fueron ellos mismos quienes mostraron una incre ble capacidad para crear estructuras en medio de la nada las mujeres mostraron una fortaleza y determinaci n decisiva que perdura hasta nuestros d as
2060380 se trata de una medida temporal pues para ellos es importante recordar que todo esto se realiz siempre con la idea de regresar a su tierra
2060381 es que la gente solo visualiza los campamentos de refugiados de tindouf y no sabe que ya existe un territorio liberado adem s del ocupado
2060382 el sahara occidental tiene cientos de kil metros de playas y mar ciudades y minas muy ricas no es un p ramo como a veces se da a entender
2060383 la gente en los territorios ocupados lo pasa muy mal los activistas pro derechos humanos son torturados desaparecidos y encarcelados si hubiese una orden pol tica de acudir en su auxilio la acatar a ahora mismo
2060384 aparentemente la milicia del polisario cuenta con un material militar que dif cilmente podr a contrarrestar la capacidad ofensiva de la dictadura marroqu pero esto mismo se pens en los setenta y la sorpresa fue que aguantamos y golpeamos durante mas de quince a os hasta el d a de hoy la voluntad de un pueblo es su mejor arma
2060385 aqu lo que hay es un claro intercambio entre espa a y marruecos si marruecos contiene la emigraci n ilegal espa a se calla sobre el sahara si espa a les vende tanques marruecos les deja el banco pesquero saharaui y as con la droga el terrorismo isl mico etc que me perdonen pero es la verdad
2060386 pero para nosotros lo mas doloroso es lo del psoe desde que felipe gonz lez vino aqu en los setenta hablando sobre nuestro derecho a la autodeterminaci n hasta la actualidad con moratinos hemos recibido una pu alada por la espalda tras otra al menos con en el pp sabemos que no tenemos nada
2060387 la mejor a y la buena vecindad que el pp nunca tuvo con marruecos

2060555 we need to examine the issues of both gulf war syndrome and the anthrax vaccine and how they can be dealt with they are political problems for us
2060556 a possible motive is his concern about the end of the vaccination program
2060557 one theory is that by launching these attacks ivins creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
2060558 dr ivins was well aware that efforts we undertook between 1998 and 2001 to challenge the legality of the vaccination program was potentially on the verge of stopping it
2060559 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program
2060560 that was going on in his mind at that particular time
2060561 i do think we need to examine the issues of both gulf war syndrome and the anthrax vaccine and how they can be dealt with they are political problems for us
2060562 it didnt bother me that rove referred to it as a political problem at the time because it meant that it would be properly dealt with finally
2060563 the political problem became a problem to me when they dropped the ball and allowed the program to continue it was politics that motivated them to investigate and it was politics that motivated them to allow the program to continue now the political nature bothers me

2060567 adverse effects may include redness or swelling where the shot was given larger than the bottom of a soda can and or more than 24 hours of headaches muscle joint pains and or fatigue tiredness that interfered with your daily activities
2060568 bioport should not be able to keep that contract for years they never met any goals or objectives for years they got bonuses that equaled or exceeded their salaries and didnt accomplish their goals

2060573 kevin blackwell has brightened the place up his recent transfers look good and weve got some good young talent coming through play offs
2060574 on paper we have the best squad weve had for ten years so i have to say play offs with an outside chance of automatic promotion if things go well
2060575 promotion is the goal but top six would be a major achievement more likely lower mid table
2060576 a season of consolidation but were still heavily in debt so mid table
2060577 im glad i brought this course this monster to its knees
2060578 it wasnt easy way back when i started playing here
2060579 it hasnt got any easier its been lengthened a lot since we played the 2004 ryder cup here luckily im hitting it a long way and hopefully i can make a couple putts to combat this tough course
2060580 i had a good u s open a good british and a couple other good tournaments
2060581 ive done well here before so maybe the course owes me one
2060582 i set my goals to make that ryder cup team and blew right through that this summer
2060583 and now im trying to get refocused here and get re energized for september
2060584 the great the best players going to win this week nobody is going to be lucky enough to escape hitting poor shots and survive this golf course i never hit woods into par 3s like im doing out here its very long very demanding and very fair youve got to hit it straight bottom line
2060585 so i dont know i couldnt tell you this setup the usual setup for the pga championship is more like a tough u s tour event this year the last couple years its gotten more like a traditional u s open type test its nearly more u s open type than the u s open is at the moment if that makes any sense its actually like they switched the two of them around this year
2060586 obviously there are plenty of good european players around now and there are plenty of them capable of winning will i be ready i think i will be ready but unfortunately you cant be a hundred percent sure until you actually tee it up and play

2060602 darling meaning no offense good god almighty those teeth are huge no way ill the hokey pokey with you
2060603 good god almighty those nails are huge no hanky panky or its jail for you
2060604 it looks like it was a hit and run or he was assaulted
2060605 with war you always pay the price and when it gets too high you bail
2060606 obama had to shift ground in order to explain a voting record more centrist on the iraq war than the words of his unrecorded but highly touted antiwar speech would suggest
2060607 mccains strength involves policy issues especially with a general electorate that in the united states is still today more center right politically than it is far left
2060608 mccain should advocate continuing the bush tax cuts and exploring private enterprise solutions to our nations health needs
2060609 repeat the reliable republican objections that universal health care would be another bottomless democratic pit nothing more than a social welfare giveaway that would destroy the private health care system
2060610 in our analysis of obamas experience as a chicago community organizer trained in saul alinskys radical socialist methodologies we warned change a slogan first introduced by alinsky was nothing more than a code word for the typical income redistribution those on the left have sought since the days of karl marx here in obamas proposal for increasing the capital gains tax we find proof for the point
2060611 obama like dukakis is vulnerable to negative information about his past that can burst any cult of personality bubble that public relations experts such as axelrod can try to create around a political persona
2060612 because we do not demonstrate moral leadership other nations have no choice but to proliferate nuclear weapons at the base of the argument obama is saying a world with nuclear weapons is our fault
2060613 wall street investment firms and u s law firms representing multinational u s corporations in their global operations lead the list of obama bundling contributors
2060614 a person who has to hide his or her smoking appears to be living in a lie moreover new age guys do not smoke new age guys who smoke out of sight cannot be trusted a new age politician dreaming of change and hoping for the future is not an image consistent with a guy who has to smoke cigarettes on campaign breaks just to make it through the day maybe thats the way obama takes such care to maintain the pretense he is a nonsmoker the smoker image conflicts with the campaign personality axelrod is trying to craft so much so that obama hid the habit from a reporter who had become like a friend to him if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
2060615 obamas secret smoking may not be a trivial issue after all looked at from a certain perspective the habit is a crack in the wall a flaw that calls into question whether the persona axelrod has crafted for obama is who obama really is or simply the person axelrod wants us to see
2060616 defeating obama will require removing the mask axelrod has placed before obamas face so that important segments of the electorate can fully appreciate how radical and politically unacceptable to them his policy views truly are
2060617 michelle might have been raised by a middle class black working family on chicagos south side but while being educated at an ivy league school she indulged in the luxury of experiencing alienation instead of being grateful for the opportunity nor was the impression diminished when the public learned that michelle like barack also got her law degree at harvard in 1988

2060631 la oportunidad nica de adentrarse en la vida de usain
2060632 they took all our money all our wedding rings all our cars they took our checkbooks credit cards you guys are going to find for us being a big time gang enterprise a lot of debt this house has become a spectacle
2060633 if somebodys on drugs im going to help them theyre trying to do to aguilar sr like they did to the hurricane or malcolm x that may sound big but in our lives he is that big
2060634 the people there have been a concern to a number of people on that block
2060635 were the type of guys that if we want a beer well have a beer
2060636 were not that kind of christians i cant talk about the fight because i wasnt there and i didnt see it if someone attacks us well defend ourselves but were not about territory or drugs
2060637 the homes we have fighting is the only thing you get kicked out for
2060638 members of our church who come from maybe a drug background and have gotten back on their feet are getting fired
2060639 it affects everything my dad mom two brothers me my sister our wives and 11 grandkids live in these two houses here our lives are never going to be the same
2060640 y hasta ahora ha contaminado lo que ha querido sin control
2060641 en unos seis meses petronor tendr lista la documentaci n donde dice que va a hacer todos los camibios exigidos y les dar n la definitiva l gicamente si no tienen esa autorizaci n tendr an que cerrar la refiner a y eso es algo impensable puesto que da trabajo a unas 3 000 personas m s los beneficios a las arcas p blicas a trav s de impuestos el siguiente paso es la resoluci n de la evaluaci n de impacto ambiental para el nuevo proyecto la coordinadora ha presentado 9 000 alegaciones y una manifestaci n en el pueblo con asistencia de 1 100 personas
2060642 lo cierto es que el pnv ha estado 35 a os con mayor a absoluta en el ayuntamiento y ha dejado hacer a petronor lo que ha querido
2060643 but nothing ive done over the years has gotten my 18 and 22 year old sons more excited than this they love this chicken
2060644 after reviewing the facts it was clear this request did not meet the criteria in the law
2060645 the rfs remains an important tool in our ongoing efforts to reduce americas greenhouse gas emissions and lessen our dependence on foreign oil in aggressive yet practical ways
2060646 we appreciate the epa taking a careful approach to the waiver request and agree with their determination that it should be denied
2060647 it is important to note that all renewable fuels qualify for the current rfs in fact if the rfs is waived or cut in half in 2008 then the growth of all biofuels including advanced biofuels such as biodiesel would be severely hindered
2060648 adem s de su extrema obesidad el gato est perfectamente sano simplemente est sobrealimentado
2060649 does not clearly recognize the right to life from conception without mentioning the word abortion the proposed constitution leaves the door open to the suppression of new life in the womb of the mother
2060650 acknowledges in every person the right to decide when and how many children to have this is understood even after they have procreated assuming in this way the acceptance of abortion
2060651 attacks the family as the fundamental unit of society and of the common good the new constitution diminishes the family when it rejects the existence of the model family to substitute it with different types of family from there it goes to equate same sex unions with the family
2060652 we have discovered that statism seems to be the connecting thread of the new constitution it speaks about rights of course but many of these rights flow from the state violating the creativity and responsibility of people within society
2060653 the statism is even more evident in the area of education
2060654 the right of parents and the recognition of freedom of instruction are contradicted when the state arrogates to itself the right to determine what must be taught and what must be ignored
2060655 its a lie and you have no right to do that you are engaging in political activity you are betraying your role as a pastor
2060656 i believe that the threats are part of an unfortunate way of doing politics in the country threats of various kinds i cant deny that they are always fearful
2060657 one isnt accustomed to this when one has a peaceful vision of the world but it is painful to confirm the aggressiveness of some people who anonymously dedicate themselves to intimidation
2060658 we will no longer permit agents of the extreme right like you to block our route
2060659 remember that accidental deaths happen daily in our country do not continue your anti woman and homophobic campaign death to traitors death to those who oppose the nation death or revolution
2060660 the church is meddling in political matters like saying that the constitution is statist
2060661 what is happening in the country is alarming there is a frontal and disgusting attack on the part of the president of the republic against the church
2060662 the saturday before last he told the people who go to church to rise up and call the priests liars that the constitution is not abortionist etc
2060663 our pastors bishops and priests who have been verbally attacked are doing a formidable evangelizing work which seeks to illuminate the consciences of all christians
2060664 president your government was inaugurated with a eucharistic celebration because you like the vast majority of ecuadorians are sons of the catholic church
2060665 liberty of expression the liberty of worship the liberty to educate our children in the faith is accompanied by the voice of our pastors
2060666 to silence the voice of the church is to silence the voice of the people is to silence the voice of god
2060667 vista en office liggen onder vuur onder meer vanwege de kosten de tijd die gebruikers nodig hebben voor configuratie en de moeizame integratie in heterogene omgevingen
2060668 dat die behoeften bestaan weten we omdat we goed contact onderhouden met onze business partners werknemers en studenten
2060669 daarnaast maken we marktanalyses en kijken we ook naar de trends in afzonderlijke sectoren zoals de gezondheidszorg en de financi le wereld
2060670 deze nieuwe behoeften leiden tot een drietal eisen aan de ict industrie
2060671 ten eerste moet de desktop van de toekomst flexibel zijn dat vraagt om onafhankelijkheid van het besturingssysteem en het gebruikte apparaat dit valt te bereiken met server managed client middleware die moet dan wel open source zijn zodat iedereen er applicaties voor kan ontwikkelen bij ibm hebben we eclipse als middleware ontwikkeld lotus notes is erop gebouwd net als diverse applicaties van anderen met onze business partners bouwen we een gemeenschap rond eclips zodat zoveel mogelijk mensen ervan kunnen profiteren
2060672 de afdeling personeelszaken heeft doorgaans een goed inzicht in de functie van werknemers die informatie kun je gebruiken om desktops aan te passen aan gebruikerscategorie n zo kun je de balans tussen automatische configuratie en zelfwerkzaamheid van de gebruiker verbeteren idealiter zou de desktop zich ook moeten aanpassen aan de situatie waarin de gebruiker zich bevindt
2060673 de derde eis is een lagere total cost of ownership
2060674 op dit moment zit de meerderheid van de softwarekosten niet in licenties maar in de mensen
2060675 open standaarden zijn de toekomst hele grote softwareprojecten zullen sowieso open source moeten zijn anders worden ze te duur en zijn ze niet te hanteren
2060676 cooler summers more wind a little bit more precipitation would be great
2060677 when you get a lot of run off by taking dirt and soil to the water that makes it more difficult for fish to breathe
2060678 when that algae decays oxygen is used by bacteria consuming that algae and that can create a low oxygen environment
2060679 our elderly veterans are dying off on us most need medical care and theyre not getting it
2060680 they want all of us in elected office to stand behind them to use our clout to support them
2060681 im honored to do that ive been doing that for 20 years
2060682 hab a una guerra y exist a el estado de sitio

2060684 que hacen que yo tenga que estar en esta sala
2060685 im not a hardcore fair trade and organics guy though i wish i was but ive found that shopping at the local farmers market is a simple and fun way to buy organic produce and preserve the environment
2060686 when i buy organic fruit and veg from local farmers i get fresh ripe food that has not been shipped from across the continent with all the pollution that entails my kids like the hustle and bustle of the market and i enjoy talking to the people who actually grow my food
2060687 this treat is a fair trade organic dark chocolate combined with the flavours of orange and spices green amp black got the combination of bitterness and spice just right as a bonus its good for you full of antioxidants its good for those who produced it fairly traded and its good for the land organically grown cocoa beans wins all around
2060688 i love jewellery ten thousand villages has an awesome selection of handcrafted jewellery ranging from earrings to bangles when you shop online and click on an item you can learn more about the artisan group that has created it and how your support is helping upon checkout you can also request a brochure to learn more about fair trade my favourite item right now is the rainbow glass bead necklace from only 16
2060689 my favourite fair trade product is jungle blend organic coffee from the just us coffee roasters co op in grand pre nova scotia i spent many hours huddled over many cups while reviewing legal documents or talking theology in the just us cafe in halifax when i lived there
2060690 every time i see an adult on a bicycle i no longer despair for the future of the human race
2060691 i love my bike for quite a few reasons its renewable i bought it used seven years ago and i work on it myself whenever it needs repair its clean it spews no carbon it also reduces congestion contributing to safer and quieter streets and when it dies i will recycle it
2060692 my bike reminds me that efficient beneficial and simple inventions still have a place in this world
2060693 i hate plastic bags seeing them in trees in ditches and on riverbanks drives me crazy aside from reducing the number of plastic bags i use pc green bins are sturdy easy to carry handles or straps and hold tons of stuff i can usually fit a weeks worth of groceries for my family into just four bins if youre skeptical buy just one and try it out for a few weeks at worst youll end up with a great catch all container for the back of the van
2060694 my reel lawn mower is inexpensive works well and gives me a good reputation in my new neighbourhood
2060695 i really like that it has no emissions and promotes a quiet community its healthy to use too because i only breathe fresh air when pushing instead of gasoline exhaust i have to admit that i still get sentimental at the smell of fresh cut lawn and exhaust fumes but ill get over it soon the whir of push mower blades will stir my imagination

2060719 fred davis the doyen of snooker now 67 years of age and too old to get his leg over prefers to use his left hand
2060720 he dribbles a lot and the opposition doesnt like it in fact you can see it all over their faces
2060721 her time is about 4 33 which shes capable of
2060722 i can see the carrot at the end of the tunnel

2060724 i owe a lot to my parents especially my mother and father
2060725 i was in a no win situation so im glad i won rather than lost
2060726 i would not say he is the best left winger in the premiership but there are none better
2060727 if history repeats itself i should think we can expect the same thing again
2060728 id like to play for an italian club like barcelona

2060731 it took a lot of bottle for tony to own up
2060732 julian dicks is everywhere its like theyve got eleven dicks on the field
2060733 just under 10 seconds for nigel mansell call it 9 5 seconds in round numbers
2060734 one of the reasons andy is playing so well is that before the final round his wife takes out his balls and kisses them
2060735 strangely in slow motion replay the ball seemed to hang in the air for even longer
2060736 sure there have been injuries and even some deaths in boxing but none of them really that serious
2060737 the lead car is absolutely unique except for the one behind it which is identical
2060738 the port elizabeth ground is more of a circle than an oval its long and square
2060739 the race course is as level as a billiard ball
2060740 there goes juan torera down the back straight opening his legs and showing his class

2060744 watch the time it gives you an indication of how fast they are running
2060745 we actually got the winner three minutes from the end but then they equalised
2060746 we didnt underestimate them they were just a lot better than we thought
2060747 we now have exactly the same situation as we had at the start of the race only exactly the opposite
2060748 well still be happy if we lose its on at the same time as the beer festival
2060749 change and speed up the read and write speed for dvd writers
2060750 every taxpayer should take a hard look at this site never before have citizens been able to so easily track the influences on their elected officials
2060751 candorville is overtly political but the labeling does bother me a bit because its also an overt relationship strip its overtly ethnic just because it has ethnic characters it deals with the same issues that i deal with on a daily basis we all think about politics from time to time but we also think about our girlfriend or our friend saying things we wish they wouldnt say its a slice of life strip
2060752 we took this peaceful action in beijing yesterday to shine a spotlight on the chinese governments lethal military crackdown inside tibet and its attempt to use the beijing olympics to cover up its human rights abuses there
2060753 as long as people of conscience actively support tibetans in their struggle for freedom and human rights pressure on china to resolve the issue will continue to grow
2060754 tibetans have risked everything to speak out for their human rights and freedom and have been brutally crushed by chinese authorities
2060755 we know that change only occurs when people of conscience openly confront injustice and as the chinese government has done everything in its power to silence tibetan voices at this critical moment it is imperative that global citizens speak out
2060756 santuccione assured me you could not be found positive so i did not give him the money

2060762 but one thing is needful and mary hath chosen that good part

2060768 the presidents athletic conference is very pleased to join the mac in this exciting new venture
2060769 this series should provide a great deal of excitement for football fans and alumni of schools in both conferences throughout the mid atlantic region
2060770 besides the excitement this east west series will generate our coaches and players welcome the opportunity to travel outside the region and face teams they would not normally encounter
2060771 we hope this concept proves to be a long term relationship

2060775 we chose a design that would make all of the attacks harder not just the ones we know about
2060776 the industry did rally like weve never seen it rally before
2060777 having played risk a number of times and never won i thought this was a good chance to do some research and make a player aid
2060778 with limited space available its important to keep things simple and without ambiguity
2060779 a simple what you do on your round was essential
2060780 the thing that sets the seasoned players apart from newbies is the use of strategies and diplomacy therefore i added a tips and strategies section and tried to simplify
2060781 we are not your normal motorcycle club some say we are too good for the bad guys and too bad for the good guys we try to live right in this wrong world and let our light shine wherever we may go
2060782 thats so september 10 is about to take on a new meaning
2060783 im extremely proud of how our players performed in the classroom over the summer
2060784 the fact that every scholarship player in our program was enrolled and we earned better than a 3 0 gpa as a team is a very significant achievement
2060785 in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted

2060812 we have good news for democracy the coalition believes it is imperative to move for impeachment against general musharraf
2060813 either to issue an order dissolving the national assembly or impose emergency rule under which the government will be suspended and a new caretaker set up would be announced
2060814 she was just giving the child some air and letting her have fun
2060815 i will see myself as a failure if i dont get the club back up at the first attempt
2060816 there is not enough evidence to suggest that well finish any higher than mid table
2060817 the locals are expecting a definite improvement on last seasons 16th place
2060818 i think a top three finish but far tougher than anyone thinks
2060819 everyone is talking positively about dungannons chances and i agree with that
2060820 i definitely believe we have a squad of players capable of competing in the 12 team league and im thoroughly looking forward to it im one of the older players in the irish league and have played in the eight 10 12 and 16 team leagues so ive had experience of a variety of formats personally i believe this is the best format sixteen teams is too many while 10 teams is not enough
2060821 our goal as a club would definitely have to be finishing in the top six before the league splits
2060822 playing in that top mini league will lift the clubs profile because we will be playing for the title and setanta cup qualification
2060823 if you finish seventh and are clear of the relegation places then its basically the end of your season to motivate players and to get them to run the extra yard or make the extra tackle is very hard when there is little to play for
2060824 i have played in the split league before and i appreciate what it means to get there

2060971 wir haben 65 2 prozent aller straftaten in bayern aufgekl rt die aufkl rungsquote lag mit 69 6 prozent in oberfranken und 67 2 prozent in niederbayern oberpfalz deutlich ber dem bereits sehr guten bayerischen gesamtwert

2061003 i think one of the most important and significant accomplishments of the past year was the engagement we saw among presidents and chancellors not only at the convention but throughout the year
2061004 we now have a strong core group of presidents who are really focused on the future direction and well being of division iii
2061005 just because we decided to put aside structural change that doesnt mean that these conversations shouldnt occur if anything theyre more important now as we begin to think about the division iii philosophy and presidential leadership
2061006 people didnt want to move to a division iv they really believe in division iii and weve heard that loud and clear from presidents
2061007 however the membership survey conducted last spring does show significant differences emerging which presents challenges and i think also opportunity for the division
2061008 i think the big challenge is clearly articulating a division iii philosophy beyond simply the prohibition of financial aid for athletics participation and i think the big opportunity we have is to shape a brighter future and also to brand division iii and to put us on the right track
2061009 first we want to develop and articulate a distinct philosophy statement for division iii thats clearly understood by all of its members
2061010 the second reason is that we really want to have stronger presidential involvement and leadership in division iii and we also want to find out what issues should presidents be involved in
2061011 and finally i think we want a stronger commitment to the division iii philosophy along with a stronger brand identity
2061012 i admit that i have been under much influence of militant free tibet organisations back home what china is doing now and what china has done are so different and i am angry with myself for not realising the distinction before now
2061013 this certainly sounds unlike anything lucy would have written i saw the original and i certainly have no memory of anything like that figuring in it it doesnt sound like her phraseology she read classics she writes beautifully and this doesnt sound at all like her style quite apart from her sentiments i would imagine its been done today students for a free tibet have in the past had tampering with their own internal emails

2061060 shooting began sometime this week be sure to keep it here for more on this
2061061 i have only played five times for northern ireland all in friendlies and mainly off the bench that is something that i want to change
2061062 i have loved every minute of playing for my country and not being involved more has been hard to take
2061063 my last cap was against wales a year and a half ago and i have never been in a squad under nigel worthington
2061064 i did play in the match against everton at coleraine last summer coming on at half time and i felt myself that i had played well that day
2061065 i thought i had given myself a chance of getting into the squad after that but i havent been in since
2061066 i dont think nigel worthington has ever come up to watch me even in the big games against celtic and rangers and im not sure hes even sent someone to see me play
2061067 i scored against both celtic and rangers last season and we have done well against the old
2061068 now that kyle lafferty and warren feeney are up here nigel worthington will have to come up and watch a few spl games
2061069 stephen craigan is here too pat mccourt has signed for celtic and there are a few under 21 internationals with scottish clubs
2061070 i know it is up to me to be playing well to get into the squad but i think i have played well and i want a chance to show what i can do for northern ireland
2061071 ive had enough pre season training to do me a lifetime
2061072 the games have been excellent though we played barcelona middlesbrough and wigan which with respect is better than playing some of the lower league teams in scotland
2061073 the barcelona game was amazing to be involved in everyone knows the quality of their players are but its not until you are actually on the same pitch as them that you realise just how good they actually are

2061080 gay media as it developed in the philippines focused on the extremes it was politics versus sex and parties we used to have a publication for the semi political in manila out and then in the likes of icon gp coverboy and valentino we had those largely focusing on more sensationalized albeit trifle issues of gay parties and of sex for sexs sake

2061083 all the way from the united states of america it took playwright jeff baron who wrote the award winning visiting mr green that was produced locally by the repertory philippines less than a week to give an exclusive interview to outrage magazine but until now and despite repeated attempts to communicate we have yet to hear from supposed local leaders of the lgbt community
2061084 there seems to be this contentment for various groups fighting the same fight to work on their own neglecting that there is more power in number
2061085 this is the very reason of our existence to help boost awareness not just of the community but within the community and the way we see best to do that is through proper information dissemination to empower lgbtqs to start acting to promote lgbtq right we may still take a while to get there but with outrage magazine we hope to make sure that come what may we will certainly get there

2061151 in our view the way for investors to think about national financials june quarter results reported last night is that the company is being hurt by the weakening economy
2061152 we view all this as temporary once the economy starts expanding again the sales pressure that the company is currently experiencing should lessen
2061153 national financial seems attractively valued on a cash earnings basis but not on net earnings which we consider the best measure of the companys economic returns

2061161 even if politicians want to make peace they have to have the masses on board
2061162 in order to get them on board you have to have a grassroots movement and the movement has to convince both societies that peaceful coexistence is the only way forward i strongly believe that this initiative is a valuable way to bring two societies closer together

2061484 some of the other conferences i have been to have talked about treatment but now people are really starting to realize that treatment as fabulous as it is and as necessary as it is will not bring an end to the pandemic so that just reinforces our belief about how important it is for the church to be a part of preventing new infections
2061485 this satellite session that we just did on the partnerships between faith and the government and business community on how when the three sectors of society can go after a problem and make a significant difference has been very encouraging to both rick and myself
2061486 the reason the church should be involved is that god cares for the sick
2061487 all you have to do is read your bible dont pay attention to what i say just read what the bible says jesus healed people he cared about their bodies so to me its really its not a matter of whether we should we be involved in hiv aids but of course we must its reflecting the heart of god which is to care for the sick

2061543 active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex
2061544 seen as a last ditch attack on dr williamss authority
2061545 by the end of the 1980s i had definitely come to the conclusion that scripture was not dealing with the predicament of persons whom we should recognise as homosexual by nature i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
2061546 if the bible is very clear as i think it is that a heterosexual indulging in homosexual activity for the sake of variety and gratification is not following the will of god does that automatically say that that is the only sort of homosexual activity there could ever be my own personal conclusion is that i can see a case for acknowledging faithful same sex relationships
2061547 legitimising or blessing of same sex unions nor ordaining those involved in same gender unions
2061548 active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex

2061557 abc nbc and cbs were tougher on obama than on republican john mccain during the first six weeks of the general election campaign and when network news people ventured opinions in recent weeks 28 of the statements were positive for obama and 72 negative

2061582 starting with the league is a positive move for the game and the main thing that all managers will be saying to their players is that they need to hit the ground running
2061583 weve had a competitive pre season programme against full time opposition like hearts ipswich town and burnley as well our european games which is all good preparation
2061584 it is fabulous that we can attract clubs like that for pre season games brilliant for the players to learn from and it can only do them good in their careers
2061585 with respect they will learn a lot more from those kind of games than against teams from the amateur ranks

2061627 zoals een beroemd chinees leider zei het maakt niet uit welke kleur een kat heeft zolang de kat ratten en muizen vangt is het een goede kat

2061630 its an honour to be made captain particularly as ive only just joined the club
2061631 i have been captain for the last four pre season matches but wasnt officially told until i got a message saying that it was on the club website and then i went out and bought the paper
2061632 it is a bit of a surprise to me but something that i can use to my advantage and hopefully the responsibility will make me a better player
2061633 the team just missed out on the play offs last season and that is our minimum goal this time
2061634 we want to be in the premier league and will work hard to achieve out aim
2061635 its an honour to be made captain particularly as ive only just joined the club

2061648 with respect to each class of claims or interests a such class has accepted the plan or b such class is not impaired under the plan
2061649 i f a class of claims is impaired under the plan at least one class of claims that is impaired under the plan has accepted the plan determined without including any acceptance of the plan by any insider
2061650 that hold at least two thirds in amount and more than one half in number of the allowed claims of such class held by creditors that have accepted or rejected such plan
2061651 that hold at least two thirds in amount of the allowed interests of such class held by holders of such interests that have accepted or rejected such plan
2061652 t he amount and number are computed on the basis of claims actually voted for or against the plan not as under chapter x formerly section 501 et seq of this title on the basis of the allowed claims in the class
2061653 would be to endorse the proposition that a creditor may sit idly by not participate in any manner in the formulation and adoption of a plan in reorganization and thereafter subsequent to the adoption of the plan raise a challenge to the plan for the first time
2061654 would effectively place all reorganization plans at risk in terms of reliance and finality
2061655 s ections 1129 a 8 and 1126 c require the affirmative assent of a creditor as the necessary means by which that creditor accepts a plan
2061656 a creditors failure to return a ballot rejecting the plan does not constitute the creditors deemed acceptance of the plan
2061657 a n acceptance or rejection shall be in writing and be signed by the creditor or equity security holder or an authorized agent
2061658 one would hope that at least there is a proper field investigation going on
2061659 its probably a problem of poverty in the sense that in fact most of the people that are dying are those that are living outside and bitten during their sleep

2061669 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2061670 if he is going to start a war he is going to lose the support of a lot of friends in the west
2061671 at the end of the day the georgians realise that time is not on their side and they could not let south ossetia and abkhazia become even more messy and russian influence even stronger
2061672 he has had plenty of warnings from the west that it wont pull any chestnuts out of the fire for him so i dont think he can count on the cavalry riding in
2061673 the russians hope he will get more than verbal support
2061674 the russians want a more direct confrontation with the west and i hope the bush administration has the wisdom not to give them that satisfaction
2061675 ultimately his nato ambitions could go out of the window
2061676 the timid civilized world has found nothing with which to oppose the onslaught of a sudden revival of barefaced barbarity other than concessions and smiles

2061687 no one is safe today from the negative impact of poor application performance whether youre a gamer a retail outlet or a salesforce com user
2061688 the question is how much money do you have to lose if the application starts crawling along at traffic jam speeds
2061689 in the past we were managing the infrastructure which really doesnt get into how the application is performing for the end users
2061690 we need to be able to be aware of and see all of the pieces that make up an application and how they affect the end user to understand when performance is going to be impacted he says
2061691 we have had instances in which a performance problem would occur because something had been put on the network such as a network interface card or a port that causes a problem with an application such as voice

2061716 the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the american people
2061717 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
2061718 congress has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare but only those specifically enumerated
2061719 constitutions should consist only of general provisions the reason is that they must necessarily be permanent and that they cannot calculate for the possible change of things
2061720 a wise and frugal government which shall leave men free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labor and bread it has earned this is the sum of good government
2061721 if congress can do whatever in their discretion can be done by money and will promote the general welfare the government is no longer a limited one possessing enumerated powers but an indefinite one subject to particular exceptions
2061722 i see and with the deepest affliction the rapid strides with which the federal branch of our government is advancing towards the usurpation of all the rights reserved to the states and the consolidation in itself of all powers foreign and domestic and that too by constructions which if legitimate leave no limits to their power it is but too evident that the three ruling branches of the federal government are in combination to strip their colleagues the state authorities of the powers reserved by them and to exercise themselves all functions foreign and domestic
2061723 whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers its acts are unauthoritative void and of no force
2061724 the purpose of a written constitution is to bind up the several branches of government by certain laws which when they transgress their acts shall become nullities to render unnecessary an appeal to the people or in other words a rebellion on every infraction of their rights on the peril that their acquiescence shall be construed into an intention to surrender those rights
2061725 now mark my words so long as we are a young and virtuous people this instrument will bind us together in mutual interests mutual welfare and mutual happiness but when we become old and corrupt it will bind no longer
2061726 it makes no difference who you vote for the two parties are really one party representing four percent of the people

2061728 it is true that christians suffer many problems in egypt but this does not warrant a plea for foreign interference as the necessary channels exist here in egypt
2061729 it is true that legally christian religious channels do not have permission to broadcast on state egyptian networks
2061730 but problems can be aired through appearing on opposition channels

2061746 gone are the days of 15 sellers commission exorbitant buyers premiums unfavourable selling prices and cherry picking only the latour lafite or la roman e in your cellar for inclusion in broking lists
2061747 so which of the most recent vintages do you prefer
2061748 well it is so hard to choose naturally all wines express our terroir we work hard to maximise the finesse balance of structure and fruit expression within the context of the vintage so all the wines have some merit blah blah blah
2061749 well after we made our blends for the year we had some press wines and various other lots left over pinotage syrah merlot etc we were intending to sell it off at the equivalent of 2 rand per bottle for distillation but our cellar master blended it well actually it would be more correct to say he just mixed it all up and we ended up with a decent wine which we can sell for 6 rand per bottle
2061750 i find such comments useless and faintly ridiculous nevertheless i understand why such comparisons are being made the wines seem to have every desirable component sometimes positioned with impeccable balance

2061763 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2061764 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2061765 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2061766 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

2061768 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground

2061770 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2061771 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2061772 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2061773 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2061774 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system
2061775 the 28 million licensed drivers in california and washington have had plenty of time to prepare for the law since the measure was adopted by the legislature back in 2006 and i think that government agencies and manufacturers of hands free products have done a really great job of creating awareness among consumers
2061776 fino all85 andato tutto bene poi ho davvero tremato ha dichiarato surkis nel finale la squadra ha rischiato leliminazione ma questa lezione ci servir per la sfida contro lo spartak dovremo battere i russi a tutti i costi
2061777 abbiamo gestito bene la partita fino a pochi minuti dal fischio finale poi le sostituzioni del drogherda ci hanno messo in crisi siamo andati in difficolt sulle palle alte e anche il nostro portiere taras lutsenko non stato impeccabile
2061778 la forza fisica degli irlandesi ci ha messi in difficolt
2061779 tutti pensavano che avremmo perso con molte reti di scarto invece abbiamo sfiorato la vittoria ha dichiarato la dynamo pensava gi allo spartak e ci ha sottovalutati invece abbiamo dimostrato di essere in grado di giocare al loro livello
2061780 but the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm werent simply controversial they werent simply a religious leaders effort to speak out against perceived injustice instead they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country a view that sees white racism as endemic and that elevates what is wrong with america above all that we know is right with america a view that sees the conflicts in the middle east as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like israel instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical islam as such reverend wrights comments were not only wrong but divisive divisive at a time when we need unity racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems
2061781 the government lied about inventing the hiv virus as a means of genocide against people of color
2061782 on a two party preferred basis alp support is unchanged at 55 while l np support is 45 this is despite
2061783 the rudd government would be pleased the roy morgan government confidence rating is 5 points however they should be concerned the
2061784 if a federal election for the house of representatives were being held today which party would receive your first preference
2061785 generally speaking do you feel that things in australia are heading in the right direction or would you say things are seriously heading in the wrong direction
2061786 i find it interesting that for the only poll in the last five years for which there is any real figure with which to compare i e the polls immediately before the 2004 election morgan 45 5 was closer to the actual coalition primary 46 7 than newspoll 45 or nielsen 49 and morgan 38 5 was also closer to the alp actual primary 37 6 than newspoll 39 and only marginally further away than nielsen 37 since we have no idea of how far away the ongoing polls are from reality whatever that means surely we should just go with what we know that in the most recent testable case morgan was better at forecasting the actual primary vote than newspoll on what possible basis should we decide that the newspoll or nielsen primary vote estimate is better than morgans

2061788 chinas embracing of kuanjie church is a misleading and deceptive ploy used by china to deceive the international community into believing the cpc is no longer persecuting christians
2061789 by creating such a system the chinese government has created a false sense of inclusion of house churches into mainstream society and has deceived many world and even evangelical leaders into believing china has ceased religious persecution unfortunately this deception has lead to the increasing persecution of the house churches across china with outside leaders adding validity to the tspm churches house churches are constantly being painted as dissenters and lawbreakers while simply trying to worship in true freedom

2061828 if we want to tackle the problem of youth crime we need to take action early to stop kids from embarking on a life of crime before its too late
2061829 the old parties are falling over each other trying to be tough on crime but nothing is being done do stop young people getting sucked in to a cycle of crime
2061830 ministers know that programmes to divert kids away from crime work and are even happy to promote such projects however they have failed to fund them properly in favour of punitive policies that grab headlines but achieve little
2061831 it is time for a new approach to youth justice which both prevents crime and confronts young people with their actions if they do break the law

2061861 the trouble with the african laws is that they not only criminalize hiv transmission but they also criminalize what they call exposure to it

2061863 the placing of these statutes on the books has had a chill effect on africa how is a person who is fearful that they might be hiv positive how would they feel if they know that they are going to be declared criminals if they go and have a test

2061978 weve been timing ourselves on 40 seconds without putting it on a clock because weve been trying to get as many repetitions as we can in practice
2061979 were typically way under 40 seconds well be using the 40 second clock at the scrimmage on saturday when we have acc officials then starting next week we will probably try to stay off on the side when we do our team against each other and run the 40 second clock just to make sure that were getting it down

2062005 to see faculty colleagues in history english sociology anthropology music and several other humanities and social science disciplines who are deeply committed to building a serious interdisciplinary program in africana studies is a truly progressive idea
2062006 africana studies came out of a critical moment in united states and world history the intersection between the great african american freedom movement and global decolonization in the 1950s 60s and 70s
2062007 inevitably students in such an environment have a wonderful range of courses to choose from and scholars to help them embark on whatever their interest will be im excited about the prospect of working with the programs excellent faculty and teaching bowdoins outstanding students and im very pleased to see the deans deep commitment to an innovative interdisciplinary program in africana studies
2062008 broad ranging research and teaching expertise engages with the african experiences on both sides of the atlantic his west african focus complements existing faculty strengths in southern and central africa and makes the study of africa at bowdoin exceptional in its breadth and depth strong in pedagogy and research

2062028 we had all the documentation from his treating physician when the injury occurred and the follow up surgeries he got to wake forest and the paper trail ended thats the problem follow up visits things like that theres nothing
2062029 the ncaa isnt disputing that there was an injury what theyre saying is that theres nothing to support that it kept him out of playing
2062030 he was upset he didnt have an opportunity to speak on his behalf but the ncaa has protocol and they feel like they had a decision they could make without ben i think that would have helped ben if he had a chance to say his side of the story but hes a resilient kid and hell bounce back
2062031 i think a lot of people felt down that hes gone now but we saw we have to step it up and start preparing for the season we cant let it kill us when they first said it i felt bad for him because im sure that was really tough in my head right then i knew i had to take a leadership role and get the team going you cant wait theres no more waiting we now know we have to pick it up now

2062083 when i leave i want to go out like elijah with a whirlwind to fuel my chariot of fire and when i look back on the stars well itll be like a candlelight in central park and it wont break my heart to say good bye
2062084 this is the city that raised me with the religion they gave me now im old enough to know my own mind it was leaving that saved me ive seen so much that has changed me so just break with your past feed your own mind
2062085 were used to the kingdom of heaven but you can tell from the general thrust of the book that im of the devils party like milton and i think its time we thought about a republic of heaven instead of the kingdom of heaven the king is dead thats to say i believe that the king is dead im an atheist but we need heaven nonetheless we need all the things that heaven meant we need joy we need a sense of meaning and purpose in our lives we need a connection with the universe we need all the things that the kingdom of heaven used to promise us but failed to deliver and furthermore we need it in this world where we do exist not elsewhere because there aint no elsewhere
2062086 we mustnt have another king worshipping the wrong thing is going to lead to trouble so we have to have a republic by which i mean that we ourselves in this world here in the physical universe where we know we live have got to make it as much like the traditional idea of heaven as we can by which i mean its a place where were connected to other people by love and joy and delight in the universe and the physical world and we have to use all the qualities we have our imagination our intelligence our scientific understanding our appreciation of art our love for each other and so on we have to work to use those things to make the world a better place which it sorely needs making
2062087 i thought wasnt it a good thing that eve did isnt curiosity a valuable quality shouldnt she be praised for risking this it wasnt after all that she was after money or gold or anything she was after knowledge what could possibly be wrong with that the physical world is our home this is where we live were not creatures from somewhere else or in exile this is our home and we have to make our homes here and understand that we are physical too we are material creatures we are born and we will die
2062088 i have always thought the schedule change was a bad decision
2062089 were trying to correct grade issues and graduation rates so we cram academics and athletics together youre essentially taking players out of the classroom to play baseball

2062091 i know this much it was very difficult on the guys
2062092 i suspect theyre eventually going to leave it up to the coaches im hoping they make some changes
2062093 i think were going to keep it the way it is now as far as i know its not on the agenda also the administrators seem to like it
2062094 we want to play 56 games but if we have to play 54 it doesnt matter if we need those two games to make a regional we didnt have the type of year we needed to have
2062095 those two games shouldnt be the difference maker for a good season or a bad season
2062096 im against reducing games in the spring but i also dont like cramming them into a tight schedule
2062097 if they start the season two weeks earlier were all in good shape we have to take nine days off for final exams at the end of the year so that presents a problem for us

2062333 we have to think to ourselves when are the midges going to be active and what can we do to put a barrier between our livestock and these midges
2062334 we will use our models to advise on best practice for measures such as stabling insecticide use and vaccination to control the spread of the bluetongue virus
2062335 the benefit of these techniques is that until very recently midge surveillance relied upon the use of light traps that sometimes did not represent what was happening on the animals very well
2062336 using these two techniques we can more easily understand the relationship between weather conditions and both background midge activity and biting attacks

2062352 children are not only fighting against aids they are fighting against time without treatment half of the children born with hiv will die before they reach their second birthday
2062353 it is imperative that all children are diagnosed and started on treatment as early as possible after diagnosis or too many children will continue to die
2062354 so few children are born with hiv in developed countries that research into pediatric formulations is not a priority for pharmaceutical companies
2062355 most of the drugs currently available are ill adapted for use in resource limited settings as they are either powders that need to be mixed with water or bitter tasting syrups that also require refrigeration and for the newly approved drugs we have no safety data for use in children
2062356 medicines alone are not enough to keep children living with hiv aids alive
2062357 they and their caregivers need to receive psychosocial support along with their treatment and care especially as they grow older and into adolescence and beyond
2062358 running in place too many patients still in urgent need of hiv aids treatment

2062363 capmex takes this work an important step forward with new micro and nano sensor technologies these technologies will provide new estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region
2062364 black carbon in soot is a major contributor to global warming

2062379 this will help our players avoid the pitfalls that some college student athletes unfortunately find themselves in
2062380 the whole purpose is to eliminate penalties and to get our football team to run each play to perfection and get everyone to do their job all the time
2062381 we are working toward perfection but we are not nearly there yet
2062382 we have just started evaluating the cornerbacks and there is a lot of competition there
2062383 we are also much deeper along the offensive and defensive lines this year than in previous years
2062384 one of the things we want to make sure with frank is that we keep him healthy and make sure other backs get some carries to keep him fresh
2062385 in regards to the receivers those two guys flair and wolfe are special players and they provide so much to the team behind those two there are a lot of talented guys who will be competing against each other

2062573 number one i think youre going to see a big turnout among voters who havent participated in process before in all racial groups i just think theres a degree of excitement this year that we havent seen in the past and so youre going to see larger turnouts youre going to see extra large turnouts among young voters we saw that in the primaries and we expect that to continue and i also think youre going to see a boost in turnout of african american voters

2062607 para atender el problema de desabastecimiento que gener el control de precios el gobierno tuvo que negociar incrementos en un grupo de productos
2062608 el gobierno trata de resolver el problema atacando la distribuci n en vez de estimular la producci n
2062609 las leyes aprobadas recientemente se traducen en que si produces alimentos te van a controlar precios te pueden estatizar decir qu produces y d nde colocas la mercanc a evidentemente esto no va a estimular la inversi n para que la oferta crezca adecuadamente

2062619 while we may be fascinated by britney spears and her professional and personal downfall for voyeuristic reasons there are real life lessons that we can benefit from on a personal note i enjoy reading the tabloids and reading about celebrities and their trials sometimes literally their court trials and tribulations for me however it is not about watching a car wreck for the purpose of seeing a car wreck rather it is about learning how these folks with all sorts of professionals to help them deal with the situations they encounter selfishly i like to learn from the mistakes of others so that perhaps i can avoid them all together or at least know better how to handle them should they or similar situations occur in my life
2062620 ive been talking to a prospective client in the banking industry about a project to have tellers blog about interesting customer encounters they have as a way to share knowledge on the behaviors of fraudsters and other front line customer service issues especially with executives who are removed from most front line customer communication
2062621 this use of legal action to silence the opposition is characteristic of authoritarian governments
2062622 it would be a gross interference with freedom of political debate in canada and grossly unfair if the courts were to interfere and by way of injunction prevent the official opposition party from using material already fully available in the public realm

2062633 many people in burma are expecting results change but we cannot expect too much from one meeting
2062634 as long as there is human suffering like there is here in burma this will be of strategic importance to the united states
2062635 he and laura bush do not just follow the burma issue but also personally believe in the cause of burma
2062636 today was not just a showcase it was totally business with issues seriously discussed
2062637 the president emphasized burma very much on this trip more so than china and other regional countries
2062638 he bush agrees that burmas political movement is homegrown and that burma must solve its own problems but the u s government will be at the forefront of support for such a movement
2062639 bush wants to hear our opinions and because of this it was helpful to some extent bush gave an ear to the ideas and experiences of those in attendance
2062640 they george and laura bush have made burma a cause u s policy is ethical and you cant expect much from ethical policy
2062641 he senior general than shwe was in denial to an extent of realities on the ground
2062642 i dont think it would have been helpful to the burmese if there had been a conflict over the delivery of aid
2062643 what we dont want to do is compound a difficult situation we were trying to make the problem better not worse
2062644 if i thought it the lifting of sanctions would make help us achieve the objective you know by changing the relationship with the government you know id give it serious consideration
2062645 i hope i can use my good relations with chinese leadership to convince them that the way forward is for there to be more civic participation citizen participation in the future of the country burma

2062666 our goal is that after these students complete the edge program they will be informed and engaged citizens of the global world which will hopefully give them an edge in whatever future path they may choose
2062667 this is a great new event on the calendar in a lovely part of the world
2062668 i am expecting a high quality field some excellent weather and a great venue it will be the perfect launching pad for my preparation for the australian open
2062669 anas appearance is the ultimate endorsement for the event and the city
2062670 she was one of the darlings of the australian open crowds in january and we imagine brisbane will quickly appreciate her demeanor athleticism power and particularly lethal forehand
2062671 this is a broader and more important collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models
2062672 the cells will allow researchers access for the first time to cell types of interest to watch the disease progress in a dish to watch what goes right or wrong well see in the years ahead that this opens the door to a new way of treating degenerative disease

2062674 consistent with our strategy to focus on our core competencies which include growing our portfolio of publishing businesses and building multi platform communities of customers based on our branded content
2062675 a growing area for subscriptions across the magazine publishing industry
2062676 it would be wicked to give it zero because it does show some very basic skills we are looking for like conveying some meaning and some spelling
2062677 its better than someone that doesnt write anything at all it shows more skills than somebody who leaves the page blank
2062678 the event is free for our valued customers this is a little something we do for them to show them our appreciation for their continued patronage of our products
2062679 we have no intention of violating the law in fact we supported the passage of the tobacco act
2062680 an event or activity organized by or on behalf of a tobacco manufacturer distributor or retailer
2062681 this is the first time they had a complaint like this against us
2062682 i have a warning to the tobacco company if we are able to prove that this concert is actually sponsored by you philip morris definitely we will train our guns on you for violating the law
2062683 that is why we only appeal to the organizers of the event to hopefully disassociate themselves from the tobacco company carry on with the event without the need of a tobacco companys sponsorship
2062684 it is a promotion of the tobacco product because you cannot get into the red list without going through the website definitely it is a promotion of their product
2062685 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone

2062692 painting is a never ending learning process thats what makes this hobby so much fun
2062693 rather than bashing the flag its better for them to take it out on the person concerned or the leaders that they dont like
2062694 i cannot reply to that because it has not been brought to my notice of any expansional programme or of any act that goes against the goodwill of the two countries
2062695 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2062696 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2062697 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2062698 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2062699 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2062700 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2062701 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2062702 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2062703 the charter will strengthen asean and instil it with a renewed sense of purpose while reaffirming key asean principles and objectives
2062704 in the case of coreflood youve got people infected who didnt do anything wrong
2062705 ich glaube dass der fu ball der hier in leverkusen immer gespielt wurde genau der ist den ich mit meinen bisherigen vereinen auch gespielt habe
2062706 wir haben oft stundenlang zusammengesessen und alles bis ins kleinste detail besprochen
2062707 mir kam es vor wie zehn jahre so intensiv war es
2062708 aber ich habe gemerkt wie sehr rudi v ller unseren trainer haben wollte
2062709 ich wollte den n chsten schritt machen und bei einem top gef hrten klub mit einer starken mannschaft anfangen
2062710 ich mache mir selbst den gr ten druck aber ich wollte ja zu einem verein der oben mitspielt und ich wusste dass ich den anspr chen hier in leverkusen gerecht werden muss
2062711 we have to admit what is good and right is definitely good and right and what is not good and not right as definitely not good and not right not everything is a conspiracy
2062712 the people want to see a highly civilised and refined political practice while the islamic principles and democracy are upheld the people do not want to be misled by any quarters
2062713 in india we believe that the number 8 is an unlucky number however the chinese believe it to be a very lucky number it has also proved to be lucky for them
2062714 the date is special although the number 8 is not a very auspicious number in numerology yet the presence of three 8 takes the total to 24 8 8 8 24 which is considered a good number in numerology
2062715 three 8s together offset the negative vibes of the number 8 as the total is 24
2062716 the concerns of some quarters including a number of cabinet ministers such as deputy prime minister datuk seri najib tun razak home minister datuk seri syed hamid albar minister in the prime ministers department datuk seri dr ahmad zahid hamidi and various non governmental organisations ngos and pas are noted
2062717 the bar council recognises and respects article 121 1a but there is a strong viewpoint that it is unjust to compel anyone to be subjected to the laws and courts based on a religion that they do not profess and this viewpoint must be addressed
2062718 we are heartened by the prime ministers recent reported statements calling for more interfaith dialogues to promote and ensure religious harmony among malaysians of diverse beliefs
2062719 however the bar council is troubled by continuing calls from certain quarters that its forum tomorrow be cancelled their claims that the forum will create misunderstanding anger and tension are in stark contrast with the pms assurances
2062720 the forum is to enable the public to understand the issue and arising problems and one day we may hold a dialogue with the protesting groups
2062721 both sides have agreed on the location shah alam they have agreed that the debate would be in bahasa malaysia based on the us presidential debate format and be moderated by datuk johan jaafar
2062722 but due to unforeseen circumstances by the time the construction was fully completed in july 2008 the actual cost has gone up to rm76 million
2062723 when the dam is finally filled up it will be the largest reservoir in the country
2062724 currently kuantan requires about 300 million litres of fresh water a day to meet the needs of the domestic and industrial sectors this is already the maximum capacity that the kuantan river can provide
2062725 in the long term it will not be easy to meet the increasing demand for fresh water especially since the kuantan river being the only source of water now is already producing at maximum capacity
2062726 if more water is siphoned from this river than is its natural capacity to provide then we will have problems particularly during the dry season
2062727 the dam would eventually increase the water level and regulate the flow of the kuantan river this would enable water treatment plants located at various points along the river bank to increase their production capacity from the current 300 million litres a day mld to 1 934 mld or 1 934 million meter cubic
2062728 this project would be able to deliver the water supply needs of the domestic and industrial sectors for kuantan until 2050

2062734 odious debts are those that have been incurred against the interests of the population of a state without its consent and with full awareness of the creditors
2062735 in this country with this charge nothing surprises me anymore
2062736 until last night the prime minister was still talking about rape and now its consensual
2062737 in many cases the complainant is lying if a complainant is lying he should be charged so why in this case do we believe saiful but not anwar
2062738 this is a malicious and treacherous slander i am not guilty of the charge
2062739 before when they charged me i was in prison and had very limited access to lawyers
2062740 i dont think they came prepared i believe the chambers are still under instructions this is clearly a political game the charge is clearly to embarrass me
2062741 it is an elementary principle in the criminal justice process that a man is innocent until proven guilty i do not think there is any likelihood that datuk seri will abscond im going to release him on a personal bond for the sum of rm20 000 without surety
2062742 anwar should not have been charged in the first place i will call on the solicitor general in the chambers to reconsider that they dump the prosecution altogether its not good for the country to have another cause celebre which puts our execution of justice in the dock
2062743 were obviously watching the case closely were very happy so long as the due process of law is followed
2062744 we don t know if it s true of course but even if it was it s hypocritical of the authorities to charge him if they want to they should charge half of all malaysians since even oral sex is considered an offense
2062745 what difference does the date make as long as the baby is healthy i am happy
2062746 it may be all right if the expected delivery date is only a few days before or after but its important to follow medical reasoning
2062747 there should be no cause for concern with regard to the health of either baby or mother
2062748 if the patient is a good candidate for a natural delivery then i wouldnt advise her to have a c section
2062749 a more feasible option would be to induce labour instead
2062750 its unfortunate but ben will handle this with the same resilience he has shown as a football player i know he is looking forward to the next chapter of his life whether it is playing football or pursuing a career in criminal justice

2062775 the range is comfortable with the possibility of forming a new government that is why they are hellbent to attack me
2062776 give me a break ive gone through hell already im convinced ultimately ill be vindicated
2062777 is paying close attention to the situation as are many other friends of malaysia
2062778 it is our hope that the rule of law will be applied fairly and transparently
2062779 works minister datuk mohd zin mohamad has however allowed an exemption for vehicles that urgently need to transport their goods during peak hours
2062780 they will have to write to the malaysian highway authority mha s northern region office to apply for the exemption
2062781 we would like to also remind motorists to keep their distance between vehicles and observe all directional signs including those on the variable messaging system vms
2062782 these are promising even exciting preclinical results in this liver cancer model
2062783 our next step is to look at ways to more precisely target the nanotubes so they attach to and are taken up by cancer cells while avoiding normal tissue
2062784 he looked very ill breathing heavily through the oxygen mask but all he wanted to do was talk about the physics of this very phenomenon
2062785 oblivious of his ebbing health rick was focused in the future he had told congress in 1999 that nanotechnology would help revolutionize cancer treatment and he was a scientist wanting to know whether this technology might be one of the things that would make that possible
2062786 i realize its early in the race but dr curley and his team have moved on this carefully with utmost speed i look forward to continuing to work with them and hopefully to watching the first person be treated with this procedure the race isnt over but it needs to be taken to the finish line
2062787 preclinical results report radio waves fire up nanotubes embedded in tumors destroying liver cancer
2062788 dont play with fire dont ever touch religious and racial matters
2062789 why has the bar council been stoking the fires of disunity lately like they have been used by foreign powers who want to create chaos and intervene in the countrys internal affairs
2062790 whatever the excuses given the forum would still provoke malay sentiment and create uneasiness and public disorder particularly among the malays
2062791 it is pointless to organise forums based on intellectualism professionalism or controversial issues when the safety peace harmony and stability of the country were being compromised
2062792 tennesseans are ready for a change and ill bring them a change
2062793 all this was sort of a warm up for the real thing
2062794 i told him i would support him and do everything in my power to let a marine send lamar alexander home
2062795 presents a cogent and horrifying enough picture of the worlds leading seed manufacturer to warrant concern and fury
2062796 i understand it to some point if i put myself into a favre fanatics shoes
2062797 the things i cant understand the things i really take personally is when im driving up to the parking lot gate and punching in my punch code and somebody says f you to me that kind of bothers me or when a little kid is yelling swear words at me that kind of gets to me the boos they expect a high level of play and they miss brett favre i understand that but the f you and the little kids saying swear words to me i dont understand that
2062798 i dont feel i need to sell myself to the fans he cares about the fans in green bay
2062799 do people really feel better about themselves after they say stuff like that to me its disappointing im not too dumb im not going to say anything back to them its not my style its against my religion
2062800 well thats something that ive been doing for awhile its just something that i dont like to talk about too much its something that i really enjoy doing and ive been doing that for myself and for my family most of the time it is always involving children children are really important to me especially since i have some of my own anytime i can do something involving kids im always ready to do it and join in those projects
2062801 oh definitely thats definitely a big plus here especially now that hockey is growing more and ive started to be recognized all over places youll be eating and theyll respect your privacy they have a lot of respect im not saying that people in canada dont have any respect but the fact that like here if im in a restaurant with my kids and having a nice meal they are going to wait till were done till they come talk to me stuff like that is something that i appreciate even as a family thats something really special
2062802 oh definitely all the time it doesnt matter what city youre talking to we are proud to be predators and we hear things about the city like we dont have enough fans and stuff like that and thats definitely not true our fans are there every game its just of course we could gain a few more but we have some great fans that are coming to every game if could just get some help from corporations well be all set but are fans have been there supporting us since day 1
2062803 its pretty much an all summer thing you might take a week off early on and after that youre training every day this way at training camp youre ready to go you dont want to go crazy as well all summer you want to make sure your in great shape but at the same time you should enjoy your family
2062804 yeah i think its going to be a great training camp you know we dont know whats going to happen yet with radulov but that may open some space not only that but players that played last year will have a chance to play more of an offensive role as well its going to be great competition at training camp its going to be big decisions that nashville is going to take
2062805 yeah i dont know its just something that the last two years weve been good together i know where jason will be and we just have that connection where i know where he is going to be and i try to use that because everybody knows that he has a great shot last year i was taking advantage of that looking for his shot but then teams started to recognize i was looking for him so i started shooting myself and scored a few more goals thats something that we are going to have read a little bit better this year but its definitely fun to play together
2062806 oh definitely laughs thats definitely something that everybody knows hes got a great shot and we got to use it more and its something that we are going to work on next year especially with the powerplay we have to make sure we use that
2062807 oh definitely it was a shock nobody expected that especially with a year left on his contract he was playing in north america before so its not like that was his first year in north america so that was something really special unique i know the people in nashville didnt really appreciate that people are proud of their team and their city and didnt like him leaving with a year left on his contract we have to have some doubt though because we dont know if people like his agent or somebody back home affected this because i dont think a hockey player would make a decision like that you know its probably like some kind of flex from somebody
2062808 everybody is pretty much different i heard the stories that some guys just get crushed by their team because they are asking too much and its just a war you go there and try to defend your case and put a case for them as best you can the management is there and trying to get some money as well its not always what you want to hear but its a process that a lot of hockey players go through its different but mine wasnt too bad actually i was expecting a lot more bad things about me but it was pretty good
2062809 pretty much everything we had a few options on the table but the most important thing was i talked to a few players who used to play here and they just said a lot of great things for nashville looking at the lineup i knew it was a great lineup and wed have a chance every year to go to the stanley cup hockey wise it was an easy answer and i felt the same way about the city when i talked to the guys and it was just the place to go
2062810 its a little bit of both id say that we both have to perform well we know that after last year we all have to shape up and do better this year
2062811 i dont know i think its youve been playing in that sport and have had the same job for so long you dont want to retire you want to make sure your good years are behing you and you dont want to finish with a bad one i think you just want to make the right decision

2062820 keeping ourselves the premier museum on southwestern culture as dr robert shelton calls us we like that thats exactly what we want to be that has been and will be our mission but how we go about managing that mission needs to change
2062821 i am strongly convinced that the museum of anthropology is really what can help tucson and the state of arizona find itself and recreate itself as a 21st century state
2062822 those who today still feel a sense of impotence can do something they can support amnesty international they can help it to stand up for freedom and justice

2062850 we were assured that the report would released to the public in two weeks
2062851 i encourage you and your ministry to lend your support to the proposal for a ban on the use and production of asbestos in canada

2062855 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2062856 we definitely need more power plants and need to modernize existing ones to meet the demand for electricity in lebanon we also need to secure energy efficient plants so that the cost is lower
2062857 our existing power plants can only deliver 1 500 mw of electricity and thats one of the reasons we reached an agreement with egypt to supply us with 200 mw of power
2062858 our plants are running in full capacity the previous governments did not do their jobs and thats why we still suffer from the rationing
2062859 we have to run on a multitude of energy such as gas fuel oil and other sources of energy

2062864 unfortunately thats how its going to be this early on we have guys in summer school and theyre trying to get their summer school work taken care of as well as learning the schemes i think some mistakes are to be expected but we have to continue to keep improving
2062865 were stuck in this rut where one day the defense does well and the next day the offense does well
2062866 i think we might just need to be a little more competitive about not getting into those good and bad day situations and have a good practice every time out i dont expect the defense to stone the offense and i dont expect the offense to be successful on every snap but right now were have a wave of offense one day and defense the next i think our guys just need to come out and build some consistency in their assignments
2062867 hes a veteran this is his fourth year in the program he knows the defenses hes very smart hes an excellent receiver as we saw in spring ball he does a good job of knowing how to get open in the passing game and hes made a lot of strides in the running game part of that is that hes doing a great job in the weight room hes getting stronger and feeling more comfortable trusting his technique hes had to sit behind a couple of good tight ends and was probably a guy who was ready to play a lot more last year but because of the circumstances he didnt get that opportunity i think hes excited about making the most out of it
2062868 cam is a young guy that has a lot of ability
2062869 hes shown a lot of promise when you have a young guy you want to get him as many reps as you possibly can

2062871 like most young kids its the blocking not just assignment wise but technique wise that is a little bit different than high school he needs to make some strides in that area but i like what ive seen

2062880 i plucked up the courage to investigate and i pulled out a little baby bat i just lost my breath when i saw it and i did not know what it was at first
2062881 i keep thinking how could i have not known it was there

2062921 we believe aafia has been in custody ever since she disappeared
2062922 and were not willing to believe that the discovery of aafia in afghanistan is coincidence
2062923 there are many questions that the fbi and the pakistani government need to answer in light of this admission
2062924 aafia siddiqui is a woman who has been plagued by a number of problems in her life none of which have anything to do with involvement with al qaeda
2062925 whilst we welcome this disclosure reform the fbi it has only come after mounting international pressure and five years of detention and abuse siddiquis case represents the problem of disappearances in pakistan in the most tragic way the acceptance by the fbi that siddiqui has been in custody in afghanistan raises important questions which must be answered by the pakistani and us governments siddiqui must be returned to pakistan in order to faces charges for any crime she may have committed or released along with her children

2062970 odious debts are those that have been incurred against the interests of the population of a state without its consent and with full awareness of the creditors
2062971 the debts of state have to be incurred and the funds that are derived must be used for the needs and in the interests of the state
2062972 from the point of view of the international community odious debt is understood as any debt incurred for uses that contradict contemporary international law particularly the principles of international law incorporated in the un charter

2062974 everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration can be fully realized

2062979 a treaty is void if at the time of its conclusion it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law for the purposes of the present convention a peremptory norm of general international law is a norm accepted and recognized by the international community of states as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character
2062980 ninth report on succession on states on matters other than treaties
2062981 available at www jubileeresearch org news odiouslendingfinal pdf 12 see the paper
2062982 the paper also looks at some situations where other states tribunals have rejected or questioned claims of a transitional regime to adjust or sever debt obligations based on considerations of
2062983 the international law obligation to repay debt has never been accepted as absolute and has been frequently limited or qualified by a range of equitable considerations some of which may be regrouped under the concept of
2062984 equity and justice have been brought into the disposition of debt in the case of succession because both within the main private law systems of the world and in public international law they have been long recognized as limits or qualifications to legal obligation
2062985 while general principles to be discerned from the limits of contractual obligation in domestic legal systems are one source of equity or justice it would be odd if the evolving normative content of international law itself were not also to be such a source
2062986 as any relevant rules of international law applicable between the parties

2063048 lack of honesty about content heads the list followed closely by less than dynamic presenters who need better communication skills key takeaway misleading visitors is often an innocent mistake marketers write copy about webinars given by internal or external experts and the true topic gets lost in translation sometimes the marketer manipulates the topic by including what he thinks the audience wants to hear presenters should always get a look at and sign off on the main topics being pitched by marketing opt to under sell and over deliver another key takeaway people like presenters who grab their attention even if theyre not funny although being entertaining doesnt hurt but they do need to be sufficiently dynamic unskilled presenters who read from slides will bore attendees and see head counts drop steadily throughout the session webinar speakers also feel stress although they are under less pressure than those at live events often in technology sales talented scientists and programmers dont turn out to be dynamic speakers what you gain in authority at a webinar you will lose in boredom consider sending such folks to speaker training or use a two presenter approach adding a team member with great communication skills can offset a dry presenter shorter webinars are in vogue now despite no evidence that says shorter presentations garner more opt ins or more enthusiastic reviews at the same time respondents dont seem too worried about webinars that run a full hour let the content dictate length and leave plenty of time for questions if you expect certain questions consider saving some relevant content for q amp a the change in format can enliven the audience

2063056 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
2063057 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives

2063078 caloric restriction is a way to extend life in animals if you give them less food the stress of this healthy habit actually makes them live longer
2063079 cell survival is dependent upon the ability of the cell to reduce and recycle by a mechanism called autophagy
2063080 when a cell is under stress autophagy is turned on to clean up the cell by removing damaged cellular components while recycling building blocks necessary to rebuild the cell its there to protect the cell but in aged cells theyre basically not able to adjust to stress as well
2063081 autophagy is a housekeeping mechanism that keeps cells free of damaged and thereby detrimental mitochondria and other toxic materials while recycling their building blocks nutrients needed by the cell
2063082 so if that process is maintained with age or even increased that can only be beneficial
2063083 cardiac cells have lost the capability to divide readily to replace dying cells so the maintenance of the cells survival mechanisms is crucial for the heart
2063084 what if we bypass the caloric restriction and find a way of increasing autophagy
2063085 that is instead of starving yourself you can find another way of enhancing autophagy that will allow the enhanced removal of various damaged organelles that accumulate in aged cells
2063086 the paper is a further step in the direction of showing that the stimulation of autophagy may be beneficial
2063087 scientists reveal how caloric restriction extends life by reducing toxic trash

2063193 regrettably the answer is that we didnt find any decrease of thick melanoma over the last decade
2063194 there was the possibility that early detection and greater public awareness may have had an impact on later development of thick melanoma but so far that is not the case
2063195 the problem is that it is often quite difficult to identify thick melanomas early on they tend to have a nodular shape but dont necessarily stick out above the surrounding skin or have an irregular edge theyre not always dark either and can be quite pale and flat

2063203 security personnel are swarming everywhere there are about 100 policemen and other security officials in front of the emmanuel church in sule square and there are also several of them on the eastern and southern gates of shwe dagon shrine
2063204 they came in three dyna light trucks and are armed with batons there are also several police vehicles and about 15 motorcycles they blocked the road to shwe dagon and checked anyone passing by riot police are also seen in many of the street junctions of the city
2063205 i saw a police vehicle in front of shwe mann cinema and another one at yoma bank carrying riot police with shields and batons as in the september protests
2063206 they were patrolling since yesterday in places such as hledan and insein there are about 30 police vehicles patrolling downtown but this morning there is no more patrolling they have positioned the vehicles at important junctions

2063210 aids is a very big dragon the mythological dragon was slain by saint george the original knight in shining armor but this dragon must be slain by millions and millions of foot soldiers
2063211 we are at this conference because we think this is where the church ought to be
2063212 what we have before us is a global pandemic and the church needs to show compassion kindness and the love of christ as part of the solution
2063213 what is a respectable christian ministry doing in the middle of all this
2063214 i think this is just exactly where we should be its great to be in an environment where there are so many different views around but to be able to stand here with a christian perspective putting forward what the local church is doing pointing out that so much of the healthcare and support to people living with hiv through africa particularly is being provided by churches and christians
2063215 the church in some ways has been very slow coming into the table very judgmental i said
2063216 i think its a realization of the heart of christ for marginalized people around the world and people living with hiv are often amongst the most marginalized tear fund started to take forward some innovative work with partners weve worked with trans gender communities in india weve worked with victims of sexual violence in the congo and were highlighting some of this work here but i think more than that this is a chance for the church to be changed in terms of our judgmental attitudes and in terms of the stigma that we address towards people with living with hiv and show that we actually do genuinely love everyone as the lord calls us to do
2063217 what would you say to the cynic saying well its as ive heard some people say its the gay plague its their own fault what would you say to that particularly in view of whats happening in africa
2063218 id say that each of us when we stand before god are people who need his forgiveness and grace and were not here asking how people contracted hiv but seeking to love them and look after them and support them where they are and as i say i think the church needs to change to reflect more the mind of christ and that god is using hiv to help us to do that

2063222 in 1996 toen de eerste sis kaarten er kwamen waren de meeste apothekers niet aangesloten op een netwerk het was niet evident om de verzekerbaarheidstoestand kenbaar te maken ik heb altijd gezegd dat het veel beter is om gegevens in databanken te stoppen en te ontsluiten dan ze op een kaart te zetten
2063223 de bedoeling is dat de huidige sis kaarten de laatste zijn tegen 2011 2012 zouden ze verdwijnen maar het zal van ehealth afhangen

2063241 kates tour last spring was unbelievable and an even bigger turnout than we ever expected
2063242 although her career path may be different from many of our students
2063243 kates commitment to her education is the same she is one of over 345 000 current students who know university of phoenix plays an important role in higher education today offering nontraditional working students like kate a quality alternative that is more accessible than conventional four year colleges and universities
2063244 i am looking forward to my first headlining tour with myspace and university of phoenix
2063245 while on the road im able to reach my fans through constant updates on myspace and still be able to focus on the psychology classes im taking at university of phoenix so its really the best of both worlds
2063246 i think research into alternative energy technology is moving ahead way faster than the washington politicians realize but we still need to exploit oil and coal and nuclear to bridge the gap from a hydrocarbon to post hydrocarbon economy and it is all happening without spending trillions of dollars in taxpayer money for energy themed manhattan projects or apollo programs this possible breakthrough came from mits solar revolution project which was funded to the tune of 10 million by telecommunications entrepreneur arunas chesonis heroic capitalism strikes again
2063247 all of that has to come out its an obstruction to the construction of the casino
2063248 weve determined that the activities they proposed dont have an impact on our work
2063249 it is hsps position that the work being done currently will not in any way jeopardize the archaeological investigation
2063250 both phmc the pennsylvania historical and museum commission and the corps agree
2063251 they are digging deeper now than they did when looking for archaeological evidence
2063252 the consulting parties are misquoting hsps position and deliberately misrepresenting hsps findings to date
2063253 it is hsps position that the construction and subsequent demolition of the sugar refinery i e the use of the property destroyed any potential archaeological resources which may have been present prior to the development of the sugar refinery
2063254 the only way to get anything about that site may be archaaeological remains
2063255 mr mooney paf has stated numerous times previously that he views the subsurface remains of the sugar refinery as archaeological features in turn hsp and its consultants have responded that we do not agree and have provided the evidence to support our position
2063256 that the same city later issued a demolition permit for the building and that no governmental agencies objected to the demolition of the structure
2063257 when writing the business plan they decided to stay away from the notion of a personal computer since the bankers they were talking to had no idea what a computer was or wasnt
2063258 so for the first product they needed something they could get off the ground with existing technology but the notion from the get go was to build a personal computer firm
2063259 the cognitive impairment during the biological night was twice as large as during the normal time of awakening the biological morning

2063337 brown carbon spheres in east asian outflow and their optical properties
2063338 because of the large uncertainty we have in the radiative forcing of aerosols there is a corresponding large uncertainty in the degree of radiative forcing overall
2063339 this introduces a large uncertainty in the degree of warming predicted by climate change models
2063340 if we know the optical properties and distribution of all the aerosols over the entire atmosphere then we can produce climate change models that provide more accurate prediction
2063341 the problem with this approach is that it gives the average properties of all aerosol components and at only a few wavelengths of light
2063342 we have used this approach to determine the complete optical properties of individual brown carbon nanoparticles sampled from above the yellow sea during a large international climate change experiment
2063343 this is the first time anyone has determined the complete optical properties of single nanoparticles from the atmosphere
2063344 we show that many of the carbons in our sample have optical properties that are different from those usually assumed in climate models
2063345 when you hear about predictions of future warming or changes in precipitation globally or in specific regions like the southwestern united states the predictions are based on computer model output that is ignoring brown carbon so they are going to tend to be less accurate

2063412 the freshmen have to help us this year whether they are starters or seventh or eighth guys because of our style of play we need a lot of players to contribute to our system
2063413 tanner smith has great versatility and can make plays from different positions with just one pure veteran point guard in the program in stitt obviously andre young is going to make a contribution he will up grade the shooting ability of this team
2063414 philosophically well be the same but going in on paper this team would look to be better offensively and not as good defensively our challenge is to get this team defensively as good as last year and then were better that is our overall goal to be a better team than last year
2063415 k c will be one of our leaders this year
2063416 he has a chance to have a special senior season he knows what it takes to win on a consistent basis in this league and he knows what it takes to get a team to the ncaa tournament
2063417 k c is still an under rated player in this league and nationally his best asset may be his overall basketball i q he is a terrific offensive rebounder and has one of the best assist turnover ratios in the acc and clemson history
2063418 demontez made great improvement over the course of last season
2063419 he has a unique ability to break opponents down off the dribble
2063420 he will be even more valuable this year when the three point line is lengthened i cant recall that many of his three point goals were made while he was standing next to the line most of his three point goals last year would count as three pointers this year
2063421 andre is an exciting young player i hear people compare him to former clemson all acc guard terrell mcintyre but i did not see him play much i love watching andre play because he is a winner he has toughness and he helps the shooting ability of our team
2063422 he can play two or three different positions the most important thing is that he makes basketball plays from any one of those he makes the guys around him better
2063423 he has an outstanding inside game on the baseline and can make game changing defensive plays as well he has worked hard in the off season and is ready to have an outstanding junior year
2063424 baciu is a skilled big man who gained experience as a member of the romanian national team last year
2063425 he has an outstanding baseline game and can defend down low
2063426 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead with gas prices soaring barack obama says no to offshore drilling and says hell raise taxes on electricity higher taxes more foreign oil thats the real obama

2063469 sir its euphrates sorry to be i mean i dont want to bother you at home i wouldnt call if it werent
2063470 certainly its uh the retrospective show i mean rather redcote specifically hes out of control i mean we hadnt heard a word from him for weeks because well he says he ate a spoilt duck but i have it on good authority that he was at the bathhouse last thursday around
2063471 yes i was just coming to that hes refusing to curate the show he called the entire show cat shit he threw his cell phone at one of the artists assistants he put all the works outside in the empty lot next door where some were rained on and the johansson piece suffered what seems to be a cigarette burn as you know its worth 250 i have no idea what to
2063472 hes filled the gallery with cat litter 150 bags shipped in by truck my phone is ringing off the hook the artists that know are livid and it is spreading to the others quickly theyre calling him incompetent pretentious and
2063473 oh well yes certainly i mean i see your point its just that well the show opens tomorrow night
2063474 listen weve got real problems surveillance on ollisters associates continues to turn up nothing hes still nowhere to be found

2063480 studies are showing that the addition of fluoride to municipal water supplies is having little effect on oral health
2063481 instead the recent studies provide mounting evidence that fluoride can adversely affect the neurological development of children
2063482 so technically were still in the experimental stage after 60 years
2063483 has been controlled for far too long by the dental lobby
2063484 theyre preoccupied by one tissue the teeth whereas the opponents of fluoridation like myself see the body slightly differently
2063485 i believe health canada is not giving the citizens the truth on this issue
2063486 no studies have investigated a possible relationship between fluoridated water and lower iqs in children arthritic symptoms in adults underactive thyroid glands increased bone fractures in children and earlier onset of puberty
2063487 the science has not been done in canada if you dont look you dont find
2063488 i think there is a very strong case for the precautionary removal of this mass medication from our drinking water
2063489 there are studies which show changes in iq from populations exposed to fluoride in drinking water the thing is if you look at an individual you never really know that they may have been five points higher on the iq scale
2063490 we rely on science and expert reports from around the world
2063491 the trees get away from you the grass gets away from you
2063492 weeds develop and once they develop theyre pretty hard to whack
2063493 were not too chemical prone and once in awhile well have them come in with an organic fertilizer
2063494 its not that all garden chemicals are dangerous theyre not but experts are increasingly telling us to be careful about the way were using these products
2063495 what we see a lot is people will actually be spraying it in their driveways and then theyll walk right through it and then walk onto their turf and theyll leave footprints it kills the grass
2063496 its a controlled substance so you have to be careful about applying it
2063497 so if a homeowner uses this indiscriminately there could be big problems

2063512 for legal and practical purposes freeman and colley lee have been separated since december of 2007
2063513 celebrities whose marriages in their intimate details become public knowledge are usually steering the attention themselves
2063514 the motives may vary leverage in the negotiation or settlement process personal revenge or publicity for publicitys sake the celebrity through his or her pr agent is usually the one opening the door settlements can easily be kept confidential its a private contract
2063515 having a client in the press can certainly boost a films numbers
2063516 look at the recent batman film with what happened to heath ledger and christian bale and now morgan freeman it didnt hurt some people definitely use divorce as a way to get some press of course most of them do not want that kind of coverage its too personal and too painful and i remember that uma thurman and ethan hawke spent a lot of time trying to keep their separation private with quite a lot of success
2063517 people sit in los angeles superior court sifting through papers and they do the same in orange county superior court where whitney houston and bobby brown went thinking they could keep their divorce quiet
2063518 if you have any hint of contention in those papers anything salacious or possibly scandalous or if theres a big pre nup involved then there can be trouble
2063519 judges can be made to handle the whole case so those involved dont even have to go to court
2063520 after the petition is lodged all negotiations can take place behind the scenes and the settlement will never be announced in open court it usually suits both sides to work that way often a celebrity will have a pre marital agreement that guarantees the spouse far less than he or she would normally be entitled to but if they agree to keep quiet they can profit financially from the deal its a useful bargaining chip
2063521 in america right now the mainstream papers have a very high church attitude to this kind of news
2063522 its completely different to the uk where theres a highly competitive newspaper market
2063523 adultery addiction to marijuana and alcohol abusive behaviour physical abuse sexual addictions and frequent abandonment
2063524 wellbeing programmes can reduce absenteeism and prevent illness caused by stressful work environments which increase the chance of a person developing depression or anxiety
2063525 the acc like many employers the foundation works with have realised that healthcare schemes which only focus on illness are counter productive when a broader approach that focuses on health promotion will produce better results
2063526 they should be congratulated for making the wellbeing of their employees a top priority
2063527 it helps attract and retain high quality staff especially in a tight labour market
2063528 in the case of acc staff the overwhelming majority have used their cards to buys sports equipment pay for gym memberships and so on
2063529 the 250 contribution acc makes to staff activa cards is a small sum in every sense it equates to 0 005 percent of the total salary bill or 68 cents per day per person

2063535 imagine if this year millions of catholic voters simply say no no to every candidate of every political party who supports abortion
2063536 its time we stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us what candidate or political party can withstand the loss of millions of catholic voters in this election or the next
2063537 catholic voters have the power to transform our politics and if faithful citizens can build a new politics a politics that is not satisfied with the status quo but one that is dedicated to building up a new culture of life there are more than 150 million catholics in north america and if we stand together and demand better from our politicians we can transform politics and if we truly hope for a culture of life and a civilization of love then we must first think and then act in new ways

2063611 he was a sprinter and a thrower but he was so good in high jump he wasnt really relatively interested in it but he was good he won the high jump at the school champs one year and was about a centimetre from breaking the record which had been held for years but he only wanted to play footy
2063612 he couldve made it to the olympics he was so good if he had the dedication he wouldve been there but he was the first to pull out of it he had another passion
2063613 he was a star in the making he stood out i could say he was very keen on sport and even at that young age he couldve been good at rugby league with the big boys
2063614 he was very good and from being very good he became outstanding
2063615 hes very generous and giving towards his family hes got a good heart

2063624 this is an extraordinary outcome for law enforcement as it continues to work together to detect illicit drugs before they reach australia

2063626 because of the children and young persons act 1989 police cannot show you a picture of the 16 year old burglar operating in your neighbourhood

2063630 you actually have neurons reconnecting from one cell to a different cell
2063631 this kind of dramatic rewiring happens predominantly if not exclusively in early development
2063632 the ability to rewire neurons in that physical way seems to become much harder with age
2063633 evolutionarily somehow it seems to be advantageous to stop that process to stabilize the networks in your head and go on with life
2063634 it indicates that the sensory organs in the periphery the eyes at the front of the head have a mechanism to tell the brain when the eyes are ready and actually seeing something meaningful
2063635 feeling very confident that what they are going to announce will be very pleasing for investors

2063637 it tastes like meat and it can look like meat but we can actually change the composition of the product quite a lot so we can mask the meaty flavour

2063639 our work has shown how important the learning process is when using brain controlled devices
2063640 by permitting the subject to adaptively recode the generated neural activity the overall performance of the device is dramatically increased
2063641 furthermore as we have progressed in this work it has become apparent that the basic idea of intention during learning is very important and can be addressed by the direct observation of the neuronal transformations taking place during this fundamental processing
2063642 the monkey developed a great deal of skill using this physical device
2063643 we are in the process of extending this type of control to a more sophisticated wrist and hand for the performance of dexterous tasks
2063644 classic understanding of brain function has asserted that one hemisphere or one side of the brain controls arm and leg movement on the opposite side of the body
2063645 this access provided us with insights that could not be obtained using other methods
2063646 this evidence demonstrates that the brain encodes information regarding planning for movements of the same sided limb and that this information is encoded in a way that is unique from that corresponding to opposite side limb movements
2063647 to allow these patients to benefit from the use of a brain computer interface signals for control for two sides of the body must be acquired from the single functioning hemisphere alone
2063648 in this paradigm one side of the body the side opposite to the unaffected half of the brain would be controlled through normal physiologic pathways and the other side of the body the side affected by the stroke and on the same side as the unaffected hemisphere would be controlled through neuroprosthetic assistance using same side signals from the undamaged hemisphere
2063649 the existence of these neurons offers the means of creating this mapping by relating neural activity of the patient to an action observed by that patient
2063650 the neural activity is congruent because the way that the neurons fire during observation of familiar action is the same as the way they fire when the individual is performing that same action
2063651 we varied visibility of the video task components in an attempt to gain a better understanding of what facilitates the neural congruency between observation and action
2063652 the study showed that the presence of the goal of an action bears a greater impact on the strength of this congruence while the observation of the motion to this goal carries minimal importance
2063653 our results lead us to believe that when presented with the observation of a familiar action the monkeys inadvertently generate a motor command that is very similar to one that would occur if the animal were to execute the behavior
2063654 it has allowed him to continue to direct a highly successful nih funded medical research program
2063655 the initial results indicate that the bci can function without close technical oversight and can improve communication ability and quality of life this initial success suggests that a home bci system can be of practical value for people with severe motor disabilities and that caregivers without special expertise can learn to support it

2063664 the dominoes fall month by month forcing prices ever lower an asset deflation in turn becomes a debt deflation as subprimes alt as and finally prime mortgages surrender to the seemingly inevitable tide pimco estimates a total of 5 trillion dollars of mortgage loans are in risky asset categories and that nearly 1 trillion dollars of cumulative losses will finally mark the gravestone of this housing bubble the problem with writing off 1 trillion dollars from the finance industrys cumulative balance sheet is that if not matched by capital raising it necessitates a sale of assets a reduction in lending or both that in turn begins to affect economic growth creating what mohamed el erian fears as a negative feedback loop

2063778 in questo periodo sono partiti per la cina solo gli italiani interessati alle olimpiadi perch chi non lo non va l in questo momento dove tutto preso da questa grande organizzazione non c stato assolutamente nessun flusso turistico di questo periodo in cina
2063779 uno dei pi grandi tour operator per la cina in italia che da oltre ventanni collabora con il
2063780 noi abbiamo fatto partire dei gruppi e i commenti che abbiamo ricevuto sono stati quelli di una cina bella e meravigliosa di una pechino stupenda in tutto per tutto
2063781 non credo che i fatti a livello politico abbiano inciso
2063782 no risponde chinasia n per cittadini provenienti dai paesi europei n per quelli dell america
2063783 per entrare in cina popolare occorre un visto della validit di 30 giorni di entrata e uscita
2063784 solo della nostra delegazione italiana con i giornalisti saranno partite 600 700 persone mentre gli italiani che sono andati ad assistere come pubblico saranno circa 800 massimo 1000 persone
2063785 per tutto ci che turistico sono in programmazione 3 viaggi di gruppo dal 25 agosto perch le olimpiadi terminano il 24
2063786 portiamo a pechino lo spirito di pace pur sapendo che in cina c una situazione critica riguardo ai diritti civili ma lolimpiade accompagna anche questi conflitti umani che nella storia si ripetono noi speriamo nella tregua olimpica questo senso di tregua olimpica noi vogliamo proporlo attraverso questa esposizione in modo da far riflettere gli animi umani
2063787 dato che anche la cina spiega freccero legata a questa tradizione antichissima la ceramica fa parte del nostro e del loro patrimonio artistico
2063788 sono stata io a chiamare artisti da ogni parte ditalia
2063789 unaltra sfida prosegue valenza stata raggiungere pechino e la prima volta che il coni ospita una mostra darte seppure dargomento sportivo e lo ha fatto con tutti i rischi della prima volta
2063790 sono felice di poter celebrare la creazione di un genere unico di opere ispirate allo spirito olimpico sottolineato dalla qualit di sculture incisioni e pitture che veicolano un messaggio di pace dintesa tra i popoli di dialogo e fair play oltre a una sconfinata passione per lo sport la nobile tradizione dei giochi si rispecchia in queste opere concepite con lobiettivo di esprimere la libert delluomo insita nel significato della competizione agonistica a carattere universale e suggestivo analizzare il senso di queste splendide creazioni artistiche ci sentiamo ancora pi orgogliosi di rappresentare anche una categoria di artisti cos qualificata che ci esorta di fatto a primeggiare come sempre nellattesa della ormai imminente xxix edizione dei giochi olimpici estivi
2063791 ha avuto i finanziamenti per sostenere un impegno culturale molto grande a favore della medicina in genere e sopratutto dello sport
2063792 speriamo che ci sia unottima risposta da parte del pubblico afferma freccero perch il coni casa italia e il nostro paese hanno investito tanto per dare unimmagine bella di noi in risposta a tutti i casi negativi legati al nostro paese come le vicende dellimmondizia a napoli e della crisi del governo prodi
2063793 first of all records really never left they just got pushed to the side because of all the hype on cds
2063794 we then find out that cds arent all they were hyped up to be and the price really never came down like they claimed plus they are digital binary sound
2063795 the record industry did keep pressing records during this time except it was on a much smaller scale people who still owned turntables from the middle price range to high end always knew that a clean record lp was superior to the cd in sound if the record was an analog pressing in which almost all are
2063796 weve had a retail store for over ten years from 1988 2000 and went to the world wide web and decided after seven years to reopen the retail store im glad we did because i have previous customers from the past come in and i ask them what they have done for the past seven years and almost all say they still been spinning their vinyl and are glad we are back open thats a dedicated customer also weve made many new friends world wide who love the sound of records over cds countries in the u k germany sweden holland spain japan australia etc are all pressing and selling vinyl
2063797 im so amazed that almost all of my customers know that vinyl records are analog and cds are digital plus they know the difference that analog is a continuous sound wave and cds are sampled and chopped up in bits this can get a lot deeper but i dont want to get into that but you can just google in analog vs digital and it will give you the true scoop
2063798 finally i can say that most of the major record labels are up and pressing again not everything is getting pressing but lots of great artists
2063799 vinyl lps analog sound is primarily the reason lps sound better than cds it all comes down to a true continuous sound wave length vs digital sound bits with a gap between each sampled bit the system you play your records on is very important and there are quite a few variables that play a role in the sound you hear power source turntable speakers and more all come into play it can pretty deep and expensive if you want to go for the high end equipment
2063800 from what i understand is that if we took an analog pressing and tried to convert it from its source to a computer it first must go through a process converting it to binary numbers so the computer can read it so i would say yes your correct in saying that digital sound is a binary sound into bits
2063801 actually when i first open my store in 1988 i promised myself and the store that the store came first it paid my rent and let me buy more inventory to make a better store so really i personally dont have huge collection for myself i do have my favorite bands such as the rolling stones the doors beatles and pink floyd you get the idea classic rock
2063802 i have a bachelors degree in teacher college and couldnt find a teaching job in the area back in the 1970s 80s so i decided to open a retail record store
2063803 thrill and adrenaline rush that i get while crate digging what are your thoughts about record collecting
2063804 its like an easter egg hunt for me im always thumbing through record stores while on vacation looking for that rare find
2063805 i seem to always see something from the 60s or 70s i havent seen in the past
2063806 the internet is the tough place to grade records because in the retail store i leave the record open for the buyer to inspect i try to be tough on grading because i hate to have returns on the internet we grade record amp cover as a m extremely clean looks amp sounds like a new record vg possible small wear but looks and plays close to new vg minor scuffs possible small noise but no skips and plays ok vg usually end up in my 1 00 section or the goodwill
2063807 i would say that classic rock is really the best right now from college kids to the baby boomers they all seem to be playing this genre jazz and blues hold their own but i have to stick with the classic rock
2063808 our online inventory is about 6 000 records we have added a few more but since we opened the retail store ive kind of got a little behind on the data basing of our inventory we have a little over 15 000 items in the store
2063809 ebay is fine for what they do but i really dont sell much there ive had a few of the high dollars items and moved them on ebay but i really dont sell any of the 8 00 to 15 00 records there i would rather sell them on our site at www backtrackrecords com or www musicstack com or www gemm com

2063812 high end tube equipment seems to coming into the scene more and more
2063813 an audiophile record is mastered at better equipped mastering plants such as mobile fidelity classic records speakers corne and the like
2063814 regular records sound good on a middle range turntable high end turntables and equipment need high end quality records you are wasting your hard earned cash if you play a high end record on a low end turntable

2063823 as technology gets more and more powerful its important to play the role of intermediary and help people through the large volume of complexity and get to the core benefits that matter
2063824 its not about taking the mystery out of it but highlighting that these are the key things that matter to you as the end user thats different from giving all the technical specs and letting the consumer do the deciphering on whether the product fits their needs
2063825 i am more of a fan of the one a day practice because you have more time to evaluate the previous practice and make corrections
2063826 we really didnt have much time to study what we did this morning we are scheduled to have just five two a day practices this month
2063827 we couldnt block ricky sapp this evening we had a red zone passing drill and we just about had to take him out we just couldnt get anything done on offense when he was in there
2063828 i have been saying that we would play eight freshmen this year but it could be as many as last year when we played 11 that was the most since i have been here but we might break that this year i have been pleased with the class dwayne allen made some very good catches at tight end today and jonathan willard continues to play well at linebacker
2063829 el embajador nos ha comunicado que desestimaba nuestra petici n de reuni n para entregarle una carta en la que le manifest bamos nuestra preocupaci n por la situaci n de las libertades p blicas la falta de libertad de expresi n y de informaci n en china y por las condiciones en las que est n desarrollando su trabajo los periodistas extranjeros que est n enviados a los juegos ol mpicos
2063830 nos acusa de ser enemigos del pueblo chino afirmaci n que rechazamos tajantemente
2063831 trabajando en favor del pueblo chino para que se garanticen sus derechos civiles
2063832 los mayores enemigos del pueblo chino son unos dirigentes que tienen esa cerraz n mental de no reconocer que las libertades civiles est n ntimamente ligadas al desarrollo
2063833 pedimos un gesto humanitario para que en la clausura de los juegos se produzca la liberaci n masiva de todos aquellos que est n encarcelados en prisiones chinas por defender la libertad de expresi n
2063834 la situaci n de los presos encarcelados en china es inhumana
2063835 el gobierno chino est tocando techo en su desarrollo econ mico y sin libertad de expresi n no hay confianza
2063836 the kinds of information they send us is they pick a plant species thats in their garden or their local park and they agree to watch it and then the first date they see a leaf or a flower or first fruit they submit that information on our website

2063842 bolivia se encuentra en el umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional
2063843 la estrategia ya no es frenar el referendo sino derrocar al presidente de la rep blica y desplomar el orden democr tico
2063844 las manifestaciones contra el gobierno en varios departamentos opositores con el uso de recursos de las prefecturas para movilizar a grupos de personas que protagonizan hechos de violencia constituyen el preludio del golpe
2063845 lamento mucho c mo algunos en este momento faltan al respeto al pueblo y aplican esta especie de una dictadura civil atentando contra la democracia
2063846 estamos ac porque queremos una mejor manera de administrar el pa s que son las autonom as por eso estamos por el no al presidente en el referendo revocatorio y por el s al prefecto de cruce o que significa el cambio hacia una mayor independencia
2063847 de qu golpe de estado estamos hablando decir eso es una provocaci n lo nico que deseamos es vivir en libertad

2063854 has characterized his visit as an apolitical celebration of the olympic spirit and american sportsmanship
2063855 i realize the chances are extremely scant but i have high hopes with our two new cuban coaches settled in we might see ta amor winning the gold who knows i also think tshomlee and toni have very good chances in taekwondo well carefully monitor the progress of those three athletes who are our best bets for a medal
2063856 if we can avoid fighting zou in the early elimination rounds our chances for a medal are better
2063857 in the last world championships they didnt meet until the finals but one way or the other harry is prepared if he has to face zou early so be it in 2004 great britain had only one boxing qualifier amir khan and he was good for a silver im confident harry will deliver for the country
2063858 both tshom and toni are olympic veterans so they know what to expect
2063859 our players treat every fight like its the finals without putting pressure on them were hoping to get our first olympic medal in taekwondo in beijing
2063860 the competition is a little wide open because of the extra bronze medal
2063861 in the past there was a fight for the bronze now all those who lost to the two finalists in each division will face off and the last two will win a bronze each its not like in boxing where a loss will mean youre out in beijing you lose to a finalist and still get a chance for a bronze
2063862 he has the best chances because of his level of maturity
2063863 hes been dominating southeast asian swimmers and we hope he can get close to swimmers from japan and china
2063864 daniel has the genes and watching him swim i am so amazed at how naturally talented he is
2063865 he is truly just raw talent like so many other filipino swimmers who can improve so much if their talent is honed fine tuned and perfected through good coaching
2063866 hes young and has a wide open future he can do anything he puts his mind to as a distance swimmer you know hes really tough and can handle almost anything philippine swimming is in good hands in the near future
2063867 preparing to win an olympic medal is not a short term thing
2063868 from our point of view it requires a paradigm shift in boxing weve gotten cuban coaches to train our fighters but we must identify a pool of young talent for the future identifying talent is the key then we can work on our prospects with expert coaching its useless to get expert coaching if we dont have the talent to begin with
2063869 there were a few brief firefights overnight but no reported deaths or injuries

2063941 the budva date on the itinerary was a direct result of the rolling stones performing there last year
2063942 the next rate increase will most likely be the maximum under the law
2063943 the way the cpi consumer price index is going you could be looking at periodicals rates going up 5 or 6 percent for some publications about double the 2 9 percent increase we saw in may
2063944 this requires that we significantly accelerate process improvements and the realignment of resources in order to achieve long term financial success
2063945 failure to do so will threaten our ability to meet our mission of providing universal service at affordable prices
2063946 if you have a price cap you do what you can with costs but service will be affected
2063947 the mpa and abm are working with the postal service to restrain periodical costs but it will be tough

2063963 maar meestal staat voor het publiek de amusementswaarde voorop bij een concert of men wil gewoon de energie van een rockband ervaren wat wij daarentegen op het podium doen kost gewoon meer moeite het heeft ook even geduurd voordat ik me voldoende op mijn gemak voelde om daar in al mijn kwetsbaarheid te gaan staan
2063964 ik was wanhopig en had voortdurend het gevoel dat er op andere plekken interessantere dingen gebeurden
2063965 dankzij hem vond ik mijn draai en kon ik ook verder met muziek maar bij een carri re in de muziek had ik nooit stilgestaan
2063966 het is verdomd moeilijk om het als band in new york vol te houden alles is duur mensen zijn druk en iedereen is met eigen dingen bezig omdat er geen geld was bleek het dus erg moeilijk muzikanten te vinden en een vaste bandbezetting in stand te houden alleen al het organiseren van een bandrepetitie was een nachtmerrie
2063967 de vrijheid die ik hier voel heb ik niet in new york dat is nu een soort politiestaat geworden
2063968 het is als amerika zelf conservatief het anarchistische van zeg de jaren tachtig is voorbij het draait nu allemaal om commercie en dat maakt het voor kunstenaars moeilijk om te overleven iedereen wordt ook steeds verder naar de randen van de stad gedreven
2063969 dat gaf me een internationaal podium een vreemde ervaring de film is mijn verwachtingen te boven gegaan wat john cameron mitchell doet krijgt ook gelijk cultstatus ik ben hem erg dankbaar voor wat hij me heeft laten doen al die aandacht vormde de springplank voor mijn album
2063970 totdat ik daarbij betrokken raakte wist ik er niet veel van maar ik ben in tokio geweest en heb daar ook opgetreden een erg gepassioneerd scenetje dat animewereldje
2063971 anime zit slim in elkaar ik vind het ook leuk maar ben geen fan
2063972 er zijn ook duidelijk overeenkomsten zo hebben we alle drie de neiging ballads te schrijven hoewel rufus die minder centraal stelt in zijn muziek dan antony en ik niettemin verschillen we qua zangstijl heel erg
2063973 alleen denk ik dat wat wij doen helemaal geen pop is voor mij impliceert de benaming pop namelijk iets levendigs iets dat met jongerencultuur samenhangt ik wil genres en generaties overstijgen en zie dan ook het liefst dat ook mensen van in de tachtig naar de show komen en daarvan genieten

2063980 the capacity to be overwhelmed by the beautiful is astonishingly sturdy and survives amidst the harshest distractions
2063981 in a banal setting at an inconvenient time would beauty transcend
2063982 a strange feeling that people were actually ah ignoring me
2063983 does nothing less than tell human beings why they bother to live
2063984 every single time a child walked past he or she tried to stop and watch and every single time a parent scooted the kid away
2063985 beauty is a key to the mystery and a call to transcendence
2063986 a mere appearance in order the more easily to dispose of it
2063987 a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months
2063988 how i wept deeply moved by your hymns songs and the voices that echoed through your church what emotion i experienced in them those sounds flowed into my ears distilling the truth in my heart

2063991 when people have told me that because i am a catholic i cannot be an artist i have had to reply ruefully that because i am a catholic i cannot afford to be less than an artist
2063992 the tightrope that the catholic writer must walk is to forget or ignore nothing of the visually morally humanly sordid world making nothing easy for the reader while doing so in the name of a radical conviction that depends on that world being interrupted and transfigured by revelation

2064137 this is particularly true for women who are most affected by the epidemic as for far too long hiv positive women have been invited only after agendas have been set or policy decisions taken
2064138 women are on the front lines leading initiatives central to the success of the aids response yet they are not full participants at all levels of the response the power of their participation needs to be fully realized
2064139 it is necessary to fulfill the commitments made to ensuring womens and girls voices concerns and perspectives are incorporated in the decision making processes that affect their lives
2064140 hiv positive women and other key populations need to be more than bystanders or advisors in the formation of the content and direction of the aids response they must be supported to be leaders

2064145 meeting other people from all over the world who share in our faith was a totally unifying and spiritual experience the true body of christ together in love and action
2064146 the flags chants and camaraderie among the youth of the world in christ was truly inspirational and meant so much to me the encounters with the youth of the world constantly touched my heart and soul
2064147 no words can accurately describe the utter joy and happiness we all had from being so close to the successor of peter
2064148 the presence of jesus through the vicar of christ was a pure heavenly ecstasy that still permeates me
2064149 i was awed at how close we were as he drove by in the popemobile
2064150 it was truly a blessed experience to stand so close to our holy father he has such kind eyes and i realize the importance of his calling as our shepherd and am grateful that he considers the youth of the church a priority
2064151 pope benedict xvi likened the young people of the church to the apostles he challenged us to receive a new pentecost in which we would be inspired to teach and evangelize our faith
2064152 the popes messages were always uplifting and enlightening as a continued reflection of his wisdom as the successor to peter
2064153 we are truly blessed to have pope benedict xvi as our holy father his words of wisdom were filled with love and hope in our beautiful faith he called in particular to each and every one of us to be gods personal witnesses to others in our own lives and to the rest of the world
2064154 we stayed at an anglican boarding school for girls so we each had a nice bed heating and bathrooms showers that were designed for a lot of people to use
2064155 we get to the coffee tent and there was only one person standing outside
2064156 i recognized him and shouted father john this was the priest that married my wife and me almost 19 years ago what a chance was that
2064157 i think it was a great moment that showed the difference between the culture of death and the culture of life
2064158 the city was won over by the enthusiasm of the teens
2064159 we took the train up to katoomba to see the blue mountains and the rock formation the three sisters it was gorgeous and being struck by the beauty of gods creation really added to the week of pilgrimage
2064160 my most memorable moment at wyd besides standing six feet away from the pope was kneeling six feet away from a saint
2064161 one of the patrons for world youth day was blessed pier giorgio frassati the world youth day organizers transferred his incorrupt body to st marys cathedral so many pilgrims had the opportunity to make a special pilgrimage to this site
2064162 what an honor to be in the presence of such a shining example of the light of god
2064163 blessed pier giorgio frassati and blessed mother teresa reached out to me so many times on this trip and i became so much more inspired and enlightened to live my life in a total consecration to christ and his church
2064164 world youth day was an amazing experience that is continually opening my eyes to the subtle ways that god works in our lives
2064165 we came back from shopping to find the back door smashed in and on the kitchen work top
2064166 the police here didnt tell us much so i went to the station to ask why
2064167 but when i told the desk sergeant i didnt know who they were looking for they just werent interested
2064168 when i came home i noticed the fridge magnets had been rearranged and said oldham task force called
2064169 these are for children theyre not for the police to leave a message theyve raided your house
2064170 it makes me feel theyre treating me like some sort of scruff basically something on the bottom of their shoe and theyre laughing at me
2064171 i dont find it a laughing matter when my two year old son is in bed with a wooden door that can easily be pulled off every night
2064172 my son cant play in the back garden and ive had to write to the chief constable to ask for a new door i want a written apology so i can show it to my neighbours
2064173 i only moved into the street 11 days ago because its a quiet area so ive had to go round to my neighbours and explain im not an idiot or a criminal
2064174 the back door boarded up makes it look like a crack house
2064175 i work for a living we try hard to keep our heads above water with the baby and everything so i dont want to be treated like a scruff who hangs about on the streets all day
2064176 acting on the basis of intelligence officers entered the house as part of a search for a wanted man who had been recalled to prison
2064177 its not about whether you support the war in iraq or afghanistan its about supporting our soldiers
2064178 what jamie would have wanted is for our guys to be supported when they come home
2064179 its not about whether you support the war theyre fighting they are soldiers who go there to do a hard job and they do it really well
2064180 i revisited some places in america where id been with jamie and went to sea world where he swam with dolphins they showed a video of americas soldiers and everyone got up to salute i would love our own soldiers to be held in that esteem
2064181 the soldiers out there need to know not only that theyve achieved something but that they can come away from it it would boost the morale of the lads and their families to know theres an end to have a date to look forward to we have to leave it in the iraqis or the afghans own hands at some point
2064182 jamie was fearless right to the end after he died his commanding officer told me he had been at the sangha lookout with another soldier when they came under attack the other young man ducked and tried to pull jamie with him but he wouldnt back down
2064183 when he volunteered for iraq i was upset but i realised it was something he really wanted to do he saw it as an opportunity to put his training into practice and he had plans to do a back to back tour going to afghanistan after
2064184 he was gutsy and knew how dangerous it was out there but that was his strength of character as far as jamie was concerned he was a soldier he had a job to do and he wouldnt back down
2064185 when things were tough jamie would make light heart of it people looked up to him for that and i have learnt a lot from his qualities
2064186 whenever i have had low days i have drawn from his strength and if joe is posted there like jamie i will know it is what he wants to do like i would say to the parents of all servicemen and women just concentrate on them coming home
2064187 the abf does a great job at offering support which is not available elsewhere jamie would want people to support them and give them the funding they need to continue that work
2064188 before that there were around 100 corpses every day political assassinations have stopped and members of the public are now cooperating and informing authorities about incidents
2064189 we are making it harder for militia to retaliate my soldiers are convinced that they are prepared and can fight militants should they choose to come back

2064200 you wake up in a room with no memory of how you got there the door is locked and there is no obvious way to escape use your skills and knowledge to find a way to get out before the person who trapped you returns
2064201 we have made many changes to the 2008 m1 compared to the 2007 version and we have improved it a lot valentino is satisfied with our work so far of course the biggest change for us has affected valentinos side only the change of tire manufacturer after the switch we had a hard time learning how to get the best performance from the new tires and of course we had no data last year however valentino predicted that changing would be the right thing for him and he was right although of course we werent able to predict how differently the tire would behave
2064202 we have had to work a lot on the chassis setting and we have also changed the geometry of the bike in order to get a good balance with the tire character since we moved from 990cc to 800cc higher corner speed is needed in order to get faster lap times and to win therefore we have tried many different chassis settings in order to find out the best of bike geometry center of gravity rider position wheel base length chassis stiffness and so on
2064203 motogp bikes are not production bikes and thats why i always say that valentino jorge and all motogp riders are not human beings valentino has become more and more satisfied race by race and we have been able to find an ideal set up for him that enabled him to win three races in a row since then casey stoner and his team have found new solutions that have allowed them to make a big step forward and now of course we know that the remaining races will be tough although we are still leading by 25 points after the excellent win in laguna seca
2064204 our competitors great performances is a big push to all of us to improve our m1 further maybe even more than we did during last winter i would especially like to progress the electronic control system and the engine power at the moment there is no need to work more on the chassis although this is something we will have to consider for next season lately we have been experiencing some problems with acceleration on the exit of the corner so we need to work to find better bike geometry and chassis setting alongside the development of the engine control system
2064205 this is a popular discussion at the moment and we are looking at the overall situation do we need to change the rules its true that many riders have crashed this year including jorge who had a very bad series of crashes and also dani pedrosa the question is if these crashes have something to do with the current bike technology we moved from 990cc to 800cc to have safer bikes but the new bikes have a higher cornering speed and this might present a danger for some riders i think that we need to do something and the biggest issue is the electronic control system in any case it is clear that we at yamaha will have to develop a better and better ecs in order to beat our rivals i still think that the m1 is best bike out there although casey has had a string of very impressive results
2064206 the reason i always continue to be confident is because i trust valentino so much i like his way of thinking he is always positive and this rubs off on everyone else he never complains or criticizes on the contrary he is always looking forward and searching for new solutions he has exactly the same approach to problems as i have valentino always has a positive and logical way of thinking like me he has a very good sense of humor and i like this a lot i like him as a person very much the biggest shame is that my age is almost double his but the level of thinking is the same the only difference is that he is just 29 when i was 29 i never thought about tactics and strategies i have a huge respect for him he is the genius behind the bike
2064207 i like jorge very much he is a good guy and a very good rider honestly he is very different than i had expected before he joined yamaha i was impressed by his mature attitude and his fluent english he is a very smart guy smarter than i expected he has a big talent as a rider he is very smooth and very effective i am sure that in the future he will dominate in motogp at the beginning of the season we started with no ambitions we thought it was too early for him to win a race because he was a rookie he was just supposed to be here to learn about his m1 but then he surprised us with his incredible three pole positions in a row and then with his victory everything happened much earlier than we had expected generally speaking he is a very good entertainer for yamaha and for the spectators his season surpassed expectations early on but of course he has had some problems since then which we are working hard to address
2064208 after the bad crashes he has suffered he has changed his riding style somewhat aiming to improve his confidence in the electronics which can help him before the crash in laguna he was recovering and beginning to find a different way to treat a motogp bike laguna was a great pity very unlucky and another set back but i am still confident for the rest of the season although we will continue not to put any pressure on him and there is no need to hurry his learning process

2064232 we are very pleased with the significant strategic progress made thus far in 2008 despite the fact that as we have previously discussed our financial results do not yet reflect the pieces being put in place that should return imax to profitability importantly the execution of our digital roll out launched on time our future film slate is strong and growing our pipeline of new business remains robust we have the largest systems backlog in our history reflecting our joint revenue sharing strategy and we believe we have the necessary financing in place to fund our joint venture initiative looking ahead we believe the combination of having approximately 50 digital systems in operation by year end and the strength of our second half film slate led by the dark knight the imax experience should drive improved second half financial performance we continue to expect profitability in 2009
2064233 the launch of our digital technology and 100 theatre joint revenue sharing arrangement with amc are important strategic milestones for imax and represent the first steps toward what we expect to be a period of significant future growth for our organization the advent of imax digital virtually eliminates high film print costs incurred by the studios and lowers installation costs for exhibitors allowing for greater programming flexibility in addition with digital we will have the ability to show 10 to 12 major studio releases per year as opposed to six to eight historically which should translate into higher revenue and greater per theatre profitability
2064234 our joint revenue sharing business model makes it more affordable for exhibitors to be in the imax business while driving greater recurring revenue into our business this model coupled with our digital platform should enable us to rapidly increase the size of our worldwide network the installation of our commercial system backlog will roughly triple the number of imax theatres in domestic multiplexes and more than double the size of our commercial international network by 2010
2064235 the companys second quarter results reflect investments made to transition the company to a digital platform two fewer system installations for which we could recognize revenue as well as difficult year over year comparisons to last years highly successful spider man 3 the imax experience we believe the dark knight the imax experience combined with strength of our second half film slate should offset much of the softness of our year to date imax dmr film performance
2064236 the dark knight appears to be nothing short of a cultural phenomenon and we are delighted to be a part of it
2064237 in addition to a record opening weekend and continued sell outs the film is demonstrating extraordinary legs and very modest week to week drops in box office results the popularity of the film particularly in the imax format has tested our capacity constraints and we believe is heightening consumer interest in the imax experience r
2064238 as we significantly increase the number of joint revenue sharing deals we sign the film choices we make will have a greater impact on our future financial performance as we will receive a greater percentage of the box office we believe the prospective films for 2009 are the type of blockbuster content that plays well to the imax experience and should make for an exciting film slate we are experiencing unprecedented interest from studios and filmmakers in featuring major hollywood releases in imax and we are pleased to be expanding our studio relationships we believe the imax brand is becoming synonymous with event type movie going that is compelling to movie goers theatre exhibitors and the studios and we look forward to announcing additional films in the coming weeks and months

2064248 its abundantly clear in this case that the suspects intent was to kill himself and anyone else who got in the way of that goal by taking the officers firearm
2064249 the officer reacted by using his training experience to secure that firearm and prevent his attacker from achieving his goal
2064250 its part of a police officers job but the case illustrates the difficult jobs police officers do every day
2064251 just when you think your assignment to direct traffic is a matter of routine it can quickly become a life or death struggle as it did in this case

2064276 people are quite enchanted by it because its bringing new life to something now obsolete i think theres something quite poetic about that
2064277 she was church of england and a very religious woman and this was probably taboo then
2064278 there are so many questions that will never be answered im just upset she was never able to tell anyone
2064279 we were never able to hug and comfort her she was such a nice woman she probably didnt want to burden anyone else and just kept it a secret
2064280 for two years after my grandmother died my mum slept on the settee because she couldnt bear to go upstairs near her room
2064281 one day we decided to clean it out and decorate
2064282 all of a sudden my mum said whats this and i went over to have a look
2064283 she was holding a case that was in a black bag it just looked like a pile of ash
2064284 people jumped to conclusions far too easily they were making her out to be some kind of harold shipman that wasnt her she was no baby killer
2064285 we are grateful for the care consideration and thoughtfulness that we experienced during the investigation and subsequent trial and conviction of these embezzlers
2064286 there was unexpected relief at the very good news that all of the money embezzled plus interest was to be repaid
2064287 while we were satisfied that people were brought to account for their greedy deception the real loser here was the vulnerable victim who had been stripped of money she spent all her life saving up
2064288 people often forget one of the most traditional duties of a police officer we do not stop when thieves have been convicted the job is only done when victims get back what is rightfully theirs
2064289 it is greatly satisfying for me and the team that our hard work has paid off for such a deserving person
2064290 the victim in this case has always acted in good grace and with patience she reached the point where she accepted her loss when it would have been understandable to bear a grudge she has had the opportunity to speak at will about those who conned her but has kept a dignified silence throughout
2064291 difficile immaginare che litalia possa fare meglio nel terzo trimestre
2064292 the aim is to get 20 people to inspire 20 000 my husband and i have eight children and seven of them are boys for me it is very important that the young men in my house aspire to be something positive in society
2064293 that is why i was so keen we should have a launch here in manchester through the different phases of my life i have had people i can look up to role models i can talk to and ask questions of
2064294 that is what i believe is important in a role model it has to be someone you can talk to and ask questions of not a celebrity
2064295 we are in such a dynamic age this celebrity culture is such a massive influence everyone wants to get the bling and the accolades but they dont realise it is only the top one per cent who get that
2064296 here is our opportunity to celebrate the unsung heroes the parents community workers those people who tirelessly invest in their communities
2064297 this is one of the most significant outreach programmes from a government body i can remember
2064298 it is crucial we improve the life chances of young black boys
2064299 too few black men and boys achieve their full potential and the consequences of that are being seen socially and economically
2064300 there needs to be a collective effort to combat underachievement and low aspirations among our young black men these kids need realistic alternatives to show them that every opportunity is available to them
2064301 i hope that our unique plan to save the others will mean a lifeline for the threatened branches im pleased for spotland road but feel for the others
2064302 it is my view that the consultation team ignored the arguments we set out for all intents and purposes many of the decisions that the team made were a sham they had already made their minds up
2064303 the character and ambience of the lovely old market town is being diminished by men wearing unattractive dirty baggy unseemly shorts sometimes even with socks
2064304 if people have a modicum of decency and common sense they would realise it is inappropriate in every town
2064305 as far as ladies go its obviously a different matter they normally have attractive lovely legs and are an asset to the town in summer its always a pleasure to see them wearing dresses and shorts which are beautifully tailored clean and elegant
2064306 it is another example of the sort of louts and ill mannered people who are increasingly visiting knutsford in a minority and causing drunken behaviour damage and occasionally assaults peoples moral and physical behaviour are linked
2064307 shorts are often accompanied by collarless t shirts or vests or even no shirt at all is this another nail in the coffin of the rapidly downward spiral of our once lovely town
2064308 its perfectly legitimate to wear shorts on holiday in the south of france where there are other cosmopolitan holidaymakers equally in ones own private grounds i often not only wear shorts but walk around naked at my home which is completely secluded
2064309 even in boiling hot weather shorts are unacceptable people should do their shopping at a different time
2064310 the length doesnt matter three quarter length shorts are the worst a typical example of an inappropriate mode of dress it savagely detracts from my sense of wellbeing when i visit the town and see such ghastly sights i am dismayed
2064311 i wear my shorts from the beginning of february right through until the third week of october
2064312 but i suppose it depends on the style some people who wear shorts just look like pirates
2064313 i do get dressed up when i go out at night but i think shorts are fine when youre just going to the shops like i am today i cant really see the problem
2064314 i dont see a problem with men wearing shorts in the summer theyre not something that i wear every day anyway only when the weathers reasonable
2064315 knutsford is a nice place but i dont know how the fashion shops would go on if they only sold long trousers
2064316 what would happen next would you get arrested if you wore shorts
2064317 whoever said that about shorts should go to new zealand
2064318 ive just been there and you see men going to work in shorts a shirt and a tie they look very smart too
2064319 we wear shorts everywhere in australia i dont see what the problem is here

2064329 despite the governments and heis endeavours to ensure that prospective and current students are aware of the support on offer various studies and media reports suggest that students are especially unaware of bursary provision
2064330 at least 12 000 students on full state support failed to collect their bursaries in the first year of the new fee and bursary system this study will investigate why this was the case and what can be done to improve both the awareness and take up of bursaries

2064345 i think it is somewhat less than credible for the city to do its own internal investigation
2064346 noah was an agency that for the most part was a low risk agency
2064347 i request that before another cent is paid to noah that the city conduct a very careful audit of the services provided
2064348 we cannot waste our tax dollars by paying a contractor who has not provided the contracted services
2064349 in terms of the individuals who are actually conducting this review could they be subject to the investigation
2064350 i dont think thats correct i dont know where this investigation is going

2064366 so we now represent a really candid cross section of what america is
2064367 for me being a little person i never thought that i could be a model because you think of a model being 6 feet tall skinny and beautiful
2064368 and im only 3 11 so once i found out that i could say yeah im a model im like yeah thats really cool
2064369 for me they just look at me and say yeah right yeah sure
2064370 i own a talent agency right around the corner and we represent a lot of interesting people all shapes and sizes and honestly i think youd be great for us so let me give you a card here

2064387 regardless of who the quarterback is the o line is the backbone of the team

2064389 martin can be quite forgetful and told me as soon as he came home what he had done
2064390 it does seem to be stalling people stamp duty can be a big chunk of money and finding an extra 1 500 can be hard and very off putting for some its worth waiting for a chance not to pay it
2064391 its not normally a deal breaker so people who have seen a property they love and want to buy are going ahead with it others are putting in an offer but stalling the exchange of contracts which causes deals in a chain to fall through its affecting about 10 per cent of customers at the moment and its likely to grow
2064392 if the government is going to mention this they should go ahead with it we want them to bring the axe down and make a decision its very important that the housing market keeps moving at the moment because 50 per cent of it has already disappeared
2064393 i cant say weve seen an effect as yet but its early days and next week we may see sales fall further
2064394 a lot of properties in this area come in below the stamp duty limit anyway so suspending stamp duty is not a panacea you can say every little helps but this is just the government taking baby steps
2064395 stamp duty is just another one of these stupid taxes that shouldnt be there after all what do you get for paying this tax
2064396 weve waited 21 years to get married and now we cant wait i was always told how lucky the no 8 is in chinese culture and there was no way we were going to miss it we could have got married last year on the 17 07 07 which was donnas birthday and a pretty lucky date but this is even more special

2064400 one of the coaches was involved in a crash with what appears to be an articulated lorry
2064401 some young people sustained injuries fortunately none of them are life threatening they are cases of broken bones and shock
2064402 it appears that the tractor trailer collided with the bus they were both pushed on to one side of the road and the bus then partially flipped over and ended up in a ditch it was lucky really because it happened only 200 metres from a community centre a lot more people could have been hurt
2064403 motorists are used to the convenience of driving their own cars and are clearly prepared to pay the price however high to stay on the road and keep their freedom
2064404 petrol is seen as a commodity that people are just not prepared to give up
2064405 simple changes to the way you drive can help to save petrol and prevent your car from guzzling up your hard earned cash

2064418 many clients will not understand the need to apply for extension or even more importantly how to explain their circumstances well enough to justify the extension
2064419 i committed to 100 percent transparency and were working towards that but there are some issues that well never be able to solve and theres a history here i never will be able to undo
2064420 so were sitting down and talking with people and trying to help them understand what went wrong in the program its time to set realistic expectations of what this program can or cant do
2064421 the goal is not to drop people out of the program unnecessarily

2064443 sophisticated optical devices that are mechanically robust yet fully biodegradable biocompatible and implantable dont exist today
2064444 such systems would greatly expand the use of current optical technologies in areas like human and livestock health environmental monitoring and food quality
2064445 for example at a low cost we could potentially put a bioactive silk film in every bag of spinach and it could give the consumer a readout of whether or not e coli bacteria were in the bag before the food was consumed
2064446 silks spun by spiders and silkworms represent the strongest and toughest natural fibers known they offer many opportunities for functionalization processing and biological integration when compared to conventional polymers
2064447 we have optical devices embedded with enzymes that are still active after almost a year of storage at room temperature this is amazing given that the same enzyme becomes inactive if forgotten and left unrefrigerated for a few days

2064457 that four great nations flushed with victory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the most significant tributes that power has ever paid to reason
2064458 hardly have the feel of history in the making they havent merited much discussion in the presidential campaign nor are we as a nation riveted by the trial of the first defendant instead of a landmark case one that serves as a resonant reminder of the gulf separating us from our enemies we have detachment and ambiguity not just about the extent of hamdans guilt but also about the wisdom of the entire tribunal process as well as many other aspects of the prosecution of the war on terror
2064459 we never suggested he was in the top 17 or the top any teen of al qaeda i dont want to have anybody have us appear to be asserting that hes more responsible than he is or that hes higher ranking than he is
2064460 mr hamdan is being tried on accusations of conspiracy and material support of terrorism and the bush administrations military commission system itself is on trial
2064461 met diagnostic criteria for post traumatic stress disorder and major depression
2064462 nightmares intrusive thoughts memories and images amnesia for details of traumatic events lack of future orientation anxiety irritability insomnia poor concentration and memory exaggerated startle responses and hypervigilance
2064463 kept in isolation 24 hours a day with his hands and feet restrained and armed soldiers prompted him to talk by kneeing him in the back
2064464 repeatedly tied him up put a bag over his head and knocked him to the ground
2064465 highly coercive environments and conditions under which they were made
2064466 we need to evaluate to what extent it has an impact on our ability to fully portray his criminality in this case but also what it might set out for future cases
2064467 are built to make full advantage of statements obtained from detainees
2064468 is the only place in the world where he has not informed suspects of a right against self incrimination
2064469 committed terrorists off the street and out of the airlines and out of nuclear power plants and out of ports across this country and across other countries
2064470 cooperative cordial and a source of reliable information about the terrorist hierarchy
2064471 drew maps to al qaeda training camps and compounds for his captors
2064472 guided fbi and military intelligence agents to bin ladens private residences and guest houses and identified photos of terrorist kingpins still at large
2064473 built a trusting relationship with hamdan during the marathon interrogation bringing him special snacks and working to ease his concerns
2064474 mr hamdan commented that he liked mcdonalds fries and we brought fries in
2064475 grew upset and uncooperative when he was put in solitary confinement amid a series of interrogations prompting a heated complaint by crouch to military guards
2064476 hamdans mood lifted when he was allowed to call and tell his wife that he was alive
2064477 he was very grateful for the opportunity to speak to his wife a burden had been lifted from him at least his wife knew he was alive
2064478 unaware that during the night hamdan was also brought to interrogators of another us agency
2064479 without people like mr hamdan bin laden would enjoy no support he would not enjoy protection and he probably would not have been able to elude capture up to this point
2064480 did anyone ever say youve got to understand somebody can use this against you
2064481 the head of bin ladens bodyguards hamdans boss and an al qaeda errand boy arrested along with hamdan
2064482 refused to cooperate with us interrogators during their time at guant namo were eventually released without being charged
2064483 its perverse that the only person who agreed to cooperate is being hung with his own words while those who stayed silent are home and free
2064484 the possibility that other people with useful information about al qaeda will consider becoming informants
2064485 you think all of this stuff about torture is going to make people want to come to us
2064486 thats why i get upset when i hear people talking about stress positions loud music and dogs
2064487 harrowing both for what they depict and for the fact that they were admitted into evidence at all
2064488 show hamdan slumped on the floor hooded and shackled as he is badgered by his arabic speaking military interrogator in a dark room with one dim light bulb overhead an armed soldier is behind hamdan the interrogator in front
2064489 there is a sickening sense in watching that hamdan visibly scared is searching for the right words to appease the interrogator trying out ideas as they occur to him in an attempt to avoid more abuse
2064490 the dod fears that the american public will know a coercive interrogation when it sees one
2064491 a graphic 90 minute film chronicling the history of al qaeda
2064492 footage of mangled corpses in the rubble of the 1998 us embassy bombing in kenya
2064493 not alleged to have been involved in any of these attacks
2064494 he insisted that he had spoken only with soufan during the more than nine hour interview and that despite soufans persistent questioning on the subject he had never told him about swearing allegiance
2064495 cast a black cloud over these agents and those who work with the detainees
2064496 two largely separate al qaeda missions supporting islamic warriors and committing terrorist acts against enemy foreign states
2064497 it is not the defense that has requested this closed session but it is necessary according to the government to protect the information
2064498 it is my hope that the american public will someday hear mr hamdans defense
2064499 no court civilian or military has credibility when it listens to secret evidence in a closed courtroom
2064500 the reason closed sessions are so troubling at guant namo is because the government has so frequently claimed things have had to be classified to cover up abuse and torture in addition trials of this magnitude should have a public record if a significant amount of evidence and witness testimony is classified it will be very hard to trust any verdict
2064501 responsible for the 9 11 operation from a to z
2064502 he did not play any role he was not a soldier he was a driver his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
2064503 he was a driver and auto mechanic he was not at all a military man he is fit to change trucks tires change oil filters wash and clean cars and fasten cargo in pick up trucks
2064504 as the american army we have drivers cooks crewmen and legal personnel we also are human beings we have interests in life our people have wives and children and schools you can not understand terrorism and al qaeda from 9 11 operation
2064505 one of the reasons for the success of the outside operations is the secrecy of the operations so many of bin ladens inner circles have no knowledge of what he was planning and so many of members and even the trainers at the military camps do not have any knowledge of the works of the outside cells that includes the civilian employees
2064506 its a great question im not faced with it yet weve thought that through and we have plans to accommodate but ill cross that bridge when i come to it
2064507 the united states would be irresponsible not to continue to detain them until the conflict is over
2064508 whats the purpose here mr hamdan is going to be held until the government wants to release him it really has no connection to the underlying reality
2064509 gt un viaje de aquellos ideal si de plano el

2064511 if you want to start exercising again a new environment can be a big positive because you wont associate it with the baggage from the old gym
2064512 it can then be used as a motivational springboard so youll be more likely to start exercising at home
2064513 its highly decadent to put a health club on top of a building but if youre stuck working out the view might offer some reprieve
2064514 views provide people with a relationship with the outside world in terms of scale position and geography
2064515 take that away and the sense of confinement is overwhelming and cruel
2064516 when it comes to cardiovascular exercise most people want to be distracted
2064517 if they dont habitually exercise it can be boring or painful to start working out and they often need something to occupy their minds
2064518 when the tv is on people dont like it they always ask me to shut it off
2064519 when you feel good about the fact that you exercised and you did it in a hotels gym it has to be good for business

2064529 were all keen runners and have done lots of other races but this is by far the most challenging thing any of us have ever done
2064530 it is slightly daunting but were putting in lots of hard work

2064533 how on earth is bury council going to attract experienced and quality staff in the future when salaries are those of 10 years ago

2064577 it looks like i was correct when i said earlier that voter turnout was low

2064589 i sent off the cheques straight away but then i started getting letters saying i hadnt paid the gas surcharge
2064590 i was getting very annoyed about it because i didnt know what was going to happen i sent them letters and spoke to them but i didnt get anywhere the letters i received got more and more threatening then i got a final warning

2064599 i find it difficult to put my thoughts into words after removing the body of this dog
2064600 i simply cannot comprehend what has happened to this young animal and how it was found in such appalling circumstances
2064601 we need the public to help us piece together the information so we can discover the truth
2064602 the dog has very distinctive markings so i believe someone will recognise his description
2064603 he is white with brown ears and has a brown patch around his left eye a brown patch at the base of his tail and three large light brown tan patches on his body
2064604 when i attended the dog had been cut down from the tree but the twine was so tight around his neck i could not get my fingers underneath it
2064605 the dog was heavy and it would have taken a very strong person or possibly more than one person to have hung the dog
2064606 i would urge anyone with information no matter how insignificant it might seem to please give me a call

2064647 i dont have a lot of money so ive been counting on members of the democratic party in this area to help out
2064648 i think people are turned off by all the mudslinging and yes im referring to the phil roe david davis republican race
2064649 ill be attending some democratic party events coming up in cocke and unicoi counties
2064650 and im hoping that democrats that are thinking of voting republican and undecided independents will think it over and perhaps vote for me
2064651 i had to give him the benefit of the doubt he always ate everything i ever gave him and he never hit me
2064652 we all prayed for alana a young child has died and people should realise that as a community we should stick together and help catch who has done this
2064653 alanas father is coping but it is very hard all the family are devastated as well as the community
2064654 she was a lovely little girl i will not forget her they are a lovely family and you could not have asked for better neighbours but it is not the same now
2064655 the service was very solemn and lasted about 30 minutes
2064656 we are acting for an elderly man who has bowel cancer and worked at the plant from 1955 to 1980
2064657 we are trying to gather information about three areas of the plant in which he worked to try and confirm what chemicals were used and how we can then establish if chemicals linked to bowel cancer were used
2064658 we have spoken to a number of witnesses who have been aware of a large number of people who have worked in the plant and consequently died from bowel cancer
2064659 there is a long history generally of people developing bowel cancer after being exposed to chemicals also we dont know what contaminated areas might still be around the site and pose a risk to people
2064660 it was only a small fire and firefighters extinguished the fire quickly some of them were sent up on the roof to block the air vent from the laboratory to prevent fumes from spreading to the surrounding area
2064661 but the firefighters were inhaling and ingesting a cocktail of noxious chemicals
2064662 het is jammer dat het via zon show moet maar als je er met een goed liedje staat kan het wel goed zijn voor de internationale aandacht
2064663 ik merk wel dat als bijvoorbeeld perez hilton over me logt mijn myspace ontploft maar daar blijft het helaas bij
2064664 maar het is niet anders het doet me een beetje denken aan wat er jaren geleden gebeurde met het liedje torn van natalie imbruglia dat was helemaal niet van haar maar van een scandinavische zangeres genaamd ednaswap imbruglia scoorde er een wereldhit mee en die ednaswap baalde daar heel erg van weet ik nog het zal je maar gebeuren dacht ik toen nou ik weet nu hoe het voelt misschien moet ik dan maar gewoon lost gaan zingen bij het songfestival hahaha

2064672 you have to hold on to each other in the struggle for forgiveness and social justice
2064673 u s catholics have not been immune to the racial virus that has infected american society in fact in many ways we have aided and exacerbated it
2064674 when you are invited theres always something that god has in store that is interesting
2064675 standing against racism is not a core component of catholic identity
2064676 we begin with hope theres nothing to decree from mount sinai that god said there must be racism in human society
2064677 what human beings divide break and separate we can also heal unite and restore with the help of god
2064678 its a dirty little thing we dont talk about to think this is part of the church is hurtful
2064679 feel guilty if you dont respond to new understanding but dont feel guilty for history you didnt make the history
2064680 catholic social teaching is a proud legacy that we hold and cherish
2064681 the work of promoting and defending human dignity has never been popular since it so often flies in the face of prevailing public opinions and attitudes nonetheless it flows from our identity as christs followers to work for justice for those who live on the margins of society as did jesus himself
2064682 we are summoned to see the environment as a common treasure and a joint inheritance that we must preserve for those generations that will follow us our concern for the earth fits the parable paradigm quite appropriately since so many of jesus parables begin with the things of nature and presume that there will be seeds and fields and plants and vineyards that are capable of producing a harvest tomorrow whether ten fold or thirty fold or even a hundred fold
2064683 it speaks to your heart that theres a long way to go we are not where we need to be far far from it thats the unfortunate part
2064684 having so many local parishioners make the huge time and energy commitment to hear these theologians and other presenters share the why and the how to of the concrete practice of love pope benedict speaks about in deus caritas est will be an amazing gift to the community of north georgia
2064685 i hope we will also see a greater awareness of the ecumenical and interfaith dimensions of loving and living with our neighbors
2064686 you have to tell the truth of how you got where you are before you can move on
2064687 if you want authentic reconciliation youve got to begin with the hard acknowledgement of what happened to break the relationship

2064690 our teachers and administrators are working hard to improve student achievement and student success in the classroom
2064691 seeing so many schools make high growth shows that our district is continuing to move in the right direction
2064692 the abcs growth model is the best measure of how well our schools are educating students
2064693 the growth model answers the question are students learning at least at the same rate as other students across the state the record number number of our schools making high growth is indicative of a school district that is exceeding state expectations

2064709 we need wholesale transformation by making all roles flexible at every level ending the long working hours culture and challenging discriminatory attitudes women and men could participate in the workplace on an equal footing and live free from stereotypes about whose role it is to do the caring when that happens business the economy and society as a whole will all reap the benefits

2064733 there is new data they didnt fully consider and therefore the cost effectiveness calculations are wrong
2064734 this will make it harder for people trying to secure treatment in greater manchester where it is not funded routinely
2064735 we hope it will not change policy in places which are paying for it but that is a concern
2064736 if the doctors say this is an effective treatment everyone who needs it should have access to it
2064737 it makes no sense to me that they would hand cancer patients a death sentence when they could treat them
2064738 it makes me so angry that people with a critical illness like cancer cant get an effective treatment and yet they will pay for cosmetic procedures

2064744 the latest data show the slowdown in uk economic activity gathering pace and business and consumer confidence falling further
2064745 however with inflation heading higher in the next couple of months the bank is right to leave rates on hold for the time being
2064746 the mpc continues to be pulled in opposing directions by rising inflation and slowing growth however the balance of risk appears to be shifting more rapidly a cut in interest rates may be needed sooner rather than later to prevent the economy from drifting towards recession
2064747 we are not surprised that rates remained at 5 we feel that with inflation rising over the next few months possibly to up to 5 in the autumn the mpc was unable to give the economy any relief via lower rates but we are happy it had resisted the temptation to raise rates
2064748 we will be looking to somebody to develop the force and see us become the second largest in the country again after the met

2064754 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2064755 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2064756 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2064757 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2064758 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2064759 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2064760 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2064761 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2064762 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states

2064774 i was never angry about their decision i can imagine how easy it is to push that fear button in new york and theyre a private corporation they can do whatever they want
2064775 and we think readers will find kamran pashas book to be a compelling work of historical fiction that with great respect and sensitivity portrays an empowered muslim woman who helped usher islam into the world
2064776 im just so passionate about her and about telling her tale
2064777 shes one of the most influential women in history and so little is known about her in the western world i really believe she represents the potential in all women

2064811 we got up wednesday morning and went and met with coach addazio coach was telling us that they want to have the best players from across the country in the class of 2010 and they want me to be a part of it after that i was able to meet coach meyer in his office his attention to detail was amazing coach meyer spent basically about three hours with me showing me around the entire campus i loved everything he showed me it is a very cool school and i loved how it is set up when i was at friday night lights i didn t get to see the things that coach meyer showed me this time he gave me the real details we saw the campus and had an academic tour as well even though the recruiting process is a bit overwhelming right now linder knows that three teams will fight it out for his services i am really only considering three teams right now and i don t think that will change
2064812 florida notre dame are the three that i am looking at my dad and i have talked about the process and we are keeping my options open but those are the three making an early decision is something that linder has thought about but not something he is ready to commit to at this time i do think that i want to decide early how early i am not sure
2064813 i don t see the point in waiting until national signing day to do something but i am not sure i think that early next summer i might try and do something right now i am taking everything in stride
2064814 brooke voleva delle nozze in grande stile ma charlie ha insistito per mantenerle semplici
2064815 we thought the cartoons did expose muslims to hatred regardless of the context because if you look at the broader context in a post 9 11 world muslims are at a higher risk of being discriminated against
2064816 we werent shopping around for any laws we thought this was a good way to bring our concerns to the attention of the public
2064817 obviously we didnt want this to continue so another goal was perhaps to discourage people from further maligning our prophet and our religion we wanted this to have a deterrent effect
2064818 i basically told them to f off without using the swear word
2064819 i was let go because im in the media every day ive been down to the u s congress to testify ive been on cnn even thats why i was let go because if i caused them this much pain just in an investigation imagine what the trial would be like
2064820 his decision is not that i have freedom of speech his decision is that i have his approval im not interested in his approval the only test of free speech is if i can write what he disapproves of with impunity
2064821 thats what freedom of speech is to piss off some second rate bureaucrat like pardeep gundara and know that you have the right to do so because youre in canada not saudi arabia
2064822 i never wanted someones freedom of speech curtailed i always wanted to sit down with some third party for mediation and have a discussion
2064823 i withdrew my complaint because i was adding fire to the debate
2064824 both reactionary religion and militant secularism are on the rise with both displaying a rigid certainty and a desire for power that will do nothing to benefit society in this context it is vital that people with open minded faith speak up and demonstrate alternatives altmuslim com has set many good examples in this regard
2064825 you see more hostility towards muslims now than you did the year after 9 11
2064826 i want my children to grow up in a country where they as muslims feel valued
2064827 i dont have a problem with historical fiction i do have a problem with the deliberate misinterpretation of history you cant play with a sacred history and turn it into soft core pornography
2064828 as for muslims writing books that make fun of jesus that would be highly unlikely because as im sure you know muslim honor jesus as a prophet

2064841 there wasnt a sudden realization that theres something big here as long as kathleen was interested in continuing to swim she just continued she is a very tough and mature kid and the combination of these elements and those skills kept moving her along
2064842 she has always been very much a part of the team i cant say enough about kathleen
2064843 its fitting she is the one to make it she recognizes all the ones who came before her and that this one the olympics is for all of them and for the entire school community

2064858 but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
2064859 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption
2064860 efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 percent and regular maintenance can add another 4 percent many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone did we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points in other words obama is right

2064939 en konceptuell examenskollektion som upplevt det mesta i naturv g i en blandning av salt och s tt
2064940 i thought our defense in the first half did a pretty good job
2064941 we needed a win just to get that taste of losing out of our mouths we needed to win the first one we rallied and we played hard were not where wed like to be at this point but thats what the pre season is all about when you play a game like this you play with emotion itll be kind of fun next week when were back at arrowhead it will be these young guys first game at arrowhead when you look at it thats the best that could have happened to us we needed to win a game we needed to win a game we really did
2064942 i thought chan gailey did a good job of keeping them off balance a couple of times guys fell down the first pass route we tried to throw the receiver ran too deep and that was a pretty good receiver they were excited but when we settled down and got going we did some nice things we got the quarterback outside the pocket we ran the ball at times pretty well but i thought we did a nice job of balancing out our attack
2064943 i thought they did okay thats a pretty good defense we ran 17 plays i was talking to chicago head coach lovie smith and said some of our guys were going to go into the second quarter we wanted our first unit to get somewhere around 20 plays
2064944 this is our first pre season game and the first time theyve played there is a lot to build on and a lot of work to do there are a lot of young players who are going to play for us and some of them played well and some of them shot themselves in the foot but well correct them
2064945 his knee was a bit sore and we try to protect the veteran guys
2064946 i think it is because he took the team down on a drive he didnt turn the ball over he got us in and scored it was good for him but its a different football team now
2064947 i thought damon huard came in and did a good job in the two minute drive and got us down and got us another score tyler thigpen took the second half and hes a guy who hasnt had a lot of snaps he doesnt have a lot of experience and made some throws at the end that showed he can do some things
2064948 yeah he didnt want to come out he got hit and the offensive coordinator and quarterback coach got nervous and looked at me
2064949 he was okay one time he slipped a little bit and could have had a big long run two plays before the touchdown run he saw a hole and was getting ready to go if he keeps his feet he might run in from there
2064950 the whole deal that the drive to score 14 points in the first half it took us almost three games to score 14 points last year in the pre season
2064951 but its a credit to the coaches and players the bears are a pretty good defense too they know how to play defense if we keep our feet a couple of times brodie probably makes a few more nice throws
2064952 theyre fouls they put you in a bad spot offensively theyre holding you cant do it when youre backed up after that happens all youre trying to do is get some yards and get out of there and punt speaking of punts i thought our punter did a great job of punting
2064953 it was fine the contact and tackling was all i was worried about after being in there a couple of times i didnt want to come out because i was having a lot of fun running around obviously i saw a few different things in my game i want to improve so i wanted to stay out there longer
2064954 it was crazy brodie was putting the ball where he wanted to put it there was excellent pass protection from the offensive line when we had to run the ball i had a lot of options as far as where i wanted to go
2064955 you know youre on the football field youre under the lights youre in this atmosphere it really doesnt feel like a pre season game i think we really took the approach this week to try and come out and win this one we certainly showed that in the first half
2064956 of course youre a little nervous this being your first nfl game and everything but after that first series i was just doing what ive been doing in practice the past few weeks
2064957 its been wonderful i mean i miss it but its all football and i just love the game im just so blessed and so happy to be part of this organization
2064958 absolutely always i love the way the fans in chicago love me they make me feel at home i love the hospitality that they give me

2065037 we still see sales volatility from week to week especially around paycheck cycles
2065038 we are of course continuing to benefit from some inflation on the food side as a result of the recent run up in the cost of commodities and the continued run up in the price of oil and gasoline

2065045 there are undoubtedly a lot of helpful parts of this legislation for the housing industry but were already hearing from homebuyers from across the country who will now be locked out of the market because of the loss of down payment assistance programs
2065046 we still dont know all of the rules and funding allocations yet but this should nearly double our borrowing capacity which will help us make a lot more loans in the next year
2065047 it might be a boon for h amp r block and tax preparers as much as anyone
2065048 anything that is a positive like that should help to get more first time buyers into these homes
2065049 things have slowed down some in the market so we hope this will help
2065050 that makes it even more difficult for some first time buyers
2065051 some of the down payment assistance programs that are out there are excellent and usually give first time buyers the extra they need to get in their first home and then build some equity from there
2065052 but we bargained with the builder and kept counter offering

2065078 youll see a much different tempo this year with the 40 second clock
2065079 with the clock being set after every play weve got to be ready to defend the ball or run our offense as soon as the ball is placed
2065080 the players had a lot of energy and i was pleased with what i saw on both sides of the ball we really grinded with the running game for the first time both offensively and defensively
2065081 we probably practice special teams more than the average team because of what a weapon it can be for us
2065082 we have two of the better kickers in the country so its to our tactical advantage to be strong on that side of the ball

2065103 this ruling is a positive first step towards clearing our companys good name
2065104 through this lawsuit we hope to once and for all put an end to the ugly and malicious lies that the ufcw has spread about our company and our members employees through its slick negative campaigning
2065105 the ufcw has said that it intends to either extort bashas into surrendering to its campaign or destroy bashas as a viable business
2065106 in pursuit of that scheme the ufcw and its operatives have repeatedly delivered false and defamatory statements about bashas treatment of its members the health and cleanliness of its grocery stores and bashas regard for and treatment of hispanic customers and employees this ruling allows bashas the right to protect itself from the ufcws extortion
2065107 this is what bashas has been saying all along that hungry for respect is nothing more than an empty store front for the ufcw

2065114 when tottenham made their offer i was sceptical at first
2065115 but after ramos called me personally and told me that that they were selling robbie keane and that he wanted me in his side the situation changed

2065126 we should have got a much higher score than what we got at the end of the day but this is part and parcel of test cricket it is a call for win sessions
2065127 and i think we are still very much in the game if we have one or two early wickets in the morning we can be right back into the game
2065128 it is a fantastic wicket to bat on to be very honest there was hardly anything for the bowlers there was nothing for the fast bowlers nothing for the spinners it is just that we did not bat well we should have got much more score than what we got
2065129 there was hardly any grass on the surface to be very honest he bowled very well he bowled in the right channel that is what is really important on this kind of a track where there is hardly any help for the fast bowlers he bowled in the right areas
2065130 it is good because at one stage we were 198 for 9 and from there having a 50 run last wicket partnership brought right back into the game and especially after taking one wicket at the end they really got us back into the game
2065131 if you look at the amount of overs they have bowled in this entire series those two are going to take the maximum wickets
2065132 it is very difficult to answer this question because they are very quality players it is just that i am in very good nick and i am feeling good about myself feeling good about whatever is happening around my balance everything
2065133 that is what is working for me the important thing is to just go out there and keep doing these things again and again this is what test cricket and international cricket is all about
2065134 i think everyone must be analysing what mistakes they are making and they have played enough cricket to analyse what mistakes they are making it is just that it is important to rectify those mistakes and get on a move ahead that is what they have to do in the second innings

2065142 as a coaching staff you always want to get the most out of every practice opportunity but have to assess various things and make decisions that will have the best impact on your team

2065231 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2065232 i didnt say that i said that theyre working it out
2065233 we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party is fully unified heading into the november election
2065234 while no decisions have been made yet i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity
2065235 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2065236 would at least give your supporters a voice in the choice for the partys nominee
2065237 and i am going to respect the privacy of that process by not discussing it
2065238 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
2065239 bei der entwicklung des achievement systems war es uns wichtig eine n tzliche benutzeroberfl che zu gestalten einige erfolge werden zum beispiel in einer bersichtlichen liste mit einem statusbalken angezeigt der den fortschritt des jeweiligen achievements angibt dadurch garantieren wir dass der spieler wei was er bisher geschafft hat und was nicht
2065240 ich konnte dem bundestrainer keine garantie mehr geben dass ich ber das eine jahr hinaus f r das ich beim vfb stuttgart einen vertrag habe noch fu ball spielen werde insofern habe ich ihm und andreas k pke vorgeschlagen dass sie f r die deutsche nationalmannschaft nicht mehr mit mir planen
2065241 wir haben in der beurteilung der situation absolut auf einer wellenl nge gelegen ich habe mich bei jens f r gro artige leistungen in der nationalmannschaft bedankt sicher wird unser erfolg bei der wm 2006 dank des elfmeterschie ens gegen argentinien immer eng mit seinem namen verbunden bleiben aber auch bei der euro 2008 hatte er einen genauso gro en anteil an unserem erfolg
2065242 ich habe bisher nur wenige spieler kennengelernt die so positiv und pr gnant ihre erfahrung eingebracht haben um gemeinsam alles f r den erfolg zu geben
2065243 die nummer 1 f r dein land zu sein das ist doch das gr te was ein spieler erreichen kann es w re die best tigung meiner arbeit der letzten zwei jahre
2065244 es ist toll wie er als torwart mitspielt und ein spiel lesen kann er verk rpert den modernen torh ter von heute
2065245 die ganzen umst nde geben mir ein gutes gef hl ich glaube man steht mir beim dfb sehr positiv gegen ber
2065246 der bundestrainer hat mich bei em zur nummer zwei gemacht auch wenn das einige nicht zu interessieren scheint und sie lieber andere ins gepr ch bringen
2065247 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2065248 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2065249 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2065250 let me warn you that when you get on and off the train during rush hours just be sure to follow your blockers
2065251 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2065252 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2065253 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2065254 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2065255 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
2065256 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2065257 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2065258 recent studies show that administering nitrite to animals either intravenously or orally can greatly limit the damage caused by a heart attack and the stress to tissue that follows due to reperfusion the return of blood to oxygen starved heart muscle
2065259 we wondered if feeding animals much lower levels of nitrite and nitrate equivalent to what people can readily obtain from their diets could also provide protection from heart attack injury
2065260 this new appreciation of the health benefits of nitrite and nitrate is ironic
2065261 theyve traditionally been regarded as toxic because they tend to form chemicals called nitrosamines some of which are carcinogenic but recent research has found no convincing evidence that nitrite and nitrate pose a cancer risk
2065262 this large intake of nitrite and nitrate poses no known risks and could certainly help explain why the mediterranean diet is heart healthy despite its relatively high fat content
2065263 our study suggests that building up nitrite stores in heart muscle could spell the difference between a mild heart attack and one that causes lasting heart damage or death
2065264 and since nitrite also accumulate in the brain they could potentially help minimize the damage from strokes as well
2065265 payday loans plug a gap in the market you can borrow as little as 80 up to a typical maximum of 1 000 and you have to repay the debt on your next pay day so they can be useful if you need short term credit perhaps if there is a blip in your monthly budget
2065266 its not an unreasonable cost for the service and payday loans can be an effective money management tool it might for example be better to take out a payday loan than fall behind on a credit card payment or incur unauthorised overdraft charges
2065267 a payday loan is a short term emergency stop gap there are cheaper ways to borrow particularly for larger amounts over the longer term
2065268 perhaps you want to go on a shopping spree before pay day or you dont want to miss out on your mates stag party its hardly positioning the loans as an emergency stop gap and makes me question whether customers fully understand the function and cost of a payday loan
2065269 anyone who needs to roll over their loan is obviously in financial trouble the extra charges will only make matters worse and they could soon be drowning in debt i dont believe payday loans are the answer to any debt problem in fact they tend to make debt problems worse and pretty quickly
2065270 i could get a direct mail piece out faster than i could change anything on my website

2065276 political unrest along with the lack of freedom of speech in turkey forced him to abandon his native country which he still cannot return to
2065277 i played the baglama a friend played percussion another was singing
2065278 we were around 15 years old when we one day we heard that our lead singer ibrahim had been arrested in the evening as he was walking on his way home the next day he was found unconscious lying on top a garbage container he had been badly beaten up and it took him more than a month to recover after that incident he left our band and moved to another town
2065279 you are known to be politically active in this town and the young people symphasize with you more and more people in van were watching your programme so we want you to stop hosting that tv show
2065280 we werent going to be intimidated or threatened just like that
2065281 we went to the vali of the town a kind of state administration mayor and asked him to review our programme after he had watched it he told us that we had his permission to continue producing it
2065282 we had been performing at a concert venue 15 kilometres outside van on our way home our car was stopped at a road block where 15 armed police men apparently had been waiting for us they took us three musicians and our driver in a police car and drove off for weeks we were held behind bars in the cellar of the local police station without being able to contact our family or anyone outside
2065283 the driver and the singer were released after a couple of days but the percussionist and i were put in a cell together with three other persons who we knew from our high school days we could often hear screaming when people were tortured and they started with us as well right after we had arrived they took me into a room and forced me to sign a lot of different papers while they were kicking and beating me i got an injury in my back which was very painful the pain continued years later and when eventually i was hospitalised the doctors told me that the beating had slipped a disc in my spine
2065284 the only food we were given twice a day was a loaf of bread and some salty cheese which made us very thirsty actually the first three days we were arrested we didnt get any food at all because we refused to eat
2065285 this was the first time we could talk to a state lawyer and apparently our parents had been informed about this court hearing because they were present in the court room we werent allowed to talk with them but at least they could see that we were alive in the first couple of weeks our parents didnt know what had happened to us or where we had been taken and when they had asked at several police stations the police refused to confirm that we had been arrested
2065286 but i wont leave until you release my friend as well
2065287 havent they taken you didnt you hear the the court has given you a penalty of 12 years and six months in jail
2065288 there is nothing i can do you simply to have to escape now

2065294 as a gentleman fighter youre not loud and obnoxious you dont push people around youre a gentleman first and a fighter second
2065295 we dont take many of the techniques of traditional martial arts but we do take the respect the teacher student relationship the belief that you take care of your gym and you take care of each other
2065296 some mma schools are not like that they kind of push the macho attitude but were just there to teach people
2065297 theyre fighting for their food theyre fighting for their money
2065298 here what are these guys fighting for they want to be a superstar they want to justify those tattoos i think thats kind of the wrong kind of motivation and also why theyre not true fighters

2065307 stephen works hard every day to put himself in the best possible position to do well he spends a lot of time in the gym and is very fit at the moment
2065308 he has a daily routine of getting up having breakfast going for a cycle breakfast again sailing lunch cycling lunch again sailing and having two dinners in beijing the irish and great britain crews are having trouble keeping up their food intake stephen was eating out one night with the other athletes and between the eight of them they managed to eat 15 starters and 12 main courses
2065309 theyve prepared themselves well but it all comes down to the medal race which takes place during the last few days of the games
2065310 theyre sailing against the best in the world so theres certainly a lot of pressure on them
2065311 now theyve proven themselves and in beijing they just have to perform well on the day
2065312 richard trains a lot and is very dedicated to the sport
2065313 he is often away for three to four weeks at a time due to rowing and has recently been to training camps in spain portugal and italy
2065314 there are six or seven squads out there who are in with a chance and richard is definitely among them the standards are very good and it really depends on how things go on the day
2065315 his younger brother and friends from university are out there to support him in beijing the rest of his family are staying here to cheer him on from back home he doesnt want us distracting him when he needs to concentrate and we respect his wishes

2065331 you have to buy a newer car that thing youve been driving around for two years is a piece of junk
2065332 from what i saw last night it was just a move of god
2065333 it was primarily a grassroots movement of people that finally had its moment of expression
2065334 there were people here tonight who had no idea who donald miller or sara groves are
2065335 we hoped to raise enough to build 10 wells for african families which costs about 40 000
2065336 we came away with almost 80 000 thats 20 wells and enough to service a city the size of tyler with clean water for an entire year think of how thats going to impact people in africa
2065337 tyler was just ready to do something like this i guess i think people in area churches have been looking for a way to do something significant and do it together im the new guy in town but i havent even heard of anything like this much less seen it
2065338 i was absolutely overwhelmed tyler can really be proud of what happened last night ive never seen anything like it before we have the martin luther king jr rally every year but there were far more people at this
2065339 id never heard of the blood water mission before this
2065340 the project itself to give a single dollar for a single african child to have clean water for a single year who could say no to that thats why we came
2065341 id told the study group that as bad as things were for them there were people in worse situations in america we have access to clean water all the time in water fountains but others dont i showed them how many people die in africa each year from disease from bad water a dollar can get one person clean water for a year and be healthy to go to school or avoid hiv aids
2065342 i bet we could even do that you can find a dollar in change lying on the ground i bet we could find a 100 in change on the ground if we tried
2065343 we soon met that goal and we set another goal at 500 then 1 000
2065344 your story is so amazing and its really the heart of everything what were doing
2065345 one person reaching out and making a difference even in their own situations youre an inspiration to all of us
2065346 im still trying to process it all its awesome to have an amazing artist like sara groves recognize our people they have been trampled on and not shown respect by so much of society for them to see they could be used by god and inspire others was amazing
2065347 we recieved e mails at new gate from all over the world from people who were inspired by our efforts
2065348 it showed everybody that homeless people can contribute and provide for others
2065349 we just asked regular people to give what they could we broke the money counting machine at the bank with the bills we had we still have bags and bags of coins
2065350 i leave feeling im not doing it right i love church im part of a great church in portland and the pastor is my best friend but i dont go there much
2065351 i have the common book of prayer and a catholic devotional i use most i spend a lot of time in prayer i like to pray
2065352 i see things in front of me social injustice hurting people and god seems to talk to me through that on this tour ive been learning to love people that i cant see those in africa and ive never done that before
2065353 whether he talks to me directly i dont know i can see things like love or jealousy in front of me and i learn from that but i do act on things i think god has said to me
2065354 thats what really is needed in this town someone to provide that leadership
2065355 i think there needs to be more cooperation between black white and hispanic churches it hasnt really been all that effective in the past i dont know why that is but if there is a project of common interest to all of us i think weve shown that well all rally behind it
2065356 we continued our defensive scheme teaching today and i thought they picked up right where they left off yesterday
2065357 they embraced the topics and managed to perform well we tried to organize how we wanted to defend as individuals and as groups today we also focused on the beginnings of a back four we want to make sure we get that sooner than later
2065358 sometimes the heat follows a storm like that but today we got a little bit of cloud cover
2065359 we had a little breeze and the cooler temperatures probably helped us
2065360 based on their performance in fitness and training we are rewarding them with the early morning session off so we will jump right into the training session
2065361 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none
2065362 polluting a spawning area of the yellowstone cutthroat how apt trout
2065363 this is wonderland because we wonder whats under that polygon
2065364 we have found the proof that this is water ice and not something else
2065365 what excites me is that we can really reach out and touch the ice on mars now
2065366 what native martian microbes might be able to live and survive and grow in that same soil
2065367 this is the first wet chemical analysis on the martian soil and any other planet besides earth by our robotic lab assistant we basically have found what appears to be the requirements the nutrients to support life whether past present or future
2065368 the sort of soil you have there is the type of soil youd probably have in your backyard alkaline you might be able to grow asparagus in it really well this is very similar to the sort of analytical results we got from antarctica dry valleys
2065369 in fact it seems very friendly if you had it here on earth you could grow something in it very straightforward theres nothing about it thats toxic to an average ordinary plant here on earth
2065370 the status of the issue of life on mars may be briefly summarized
2065371 the spectrum of informed opinions covers a very broad spectrum with strongly bi polar ends one populated by those stating that the conditions on mars make life impossible and those at the other end accepting life on mars as proven fact
2065372 it became obvious to me that all facts considered the lr had indeed discovered living microorganisms on the surface of mars
2065373 since mars offered by far the most promising habitat for extraterrestrial life in the solar system
2065374 it is now virtually certain that the earth is the only life bearing planet in our region of the galaxy we have awakened from a dream
2065375 the failure to pursue nasas highest priority the search for life in the solar system
2065376 it results from nasas fear of finding out that its original conclusion about viking was wrong supplemented by philosophical and religious elements who insist for non scientific reasons there can be no life elsewhere but earth
2065377 stay with us we have promised to have answers by the end of august
2065378 they certainly make it clear that mars was once habitable i e had liquid water

2065383 superleague formula is an exciting new concept and looks to bring together two of the most popular sports in the world

2065385 some of the biggest football clubs in the world are involved and we are pleased to be joining them we intend to be as competitive on the track as we are on the pitch
2065386 we hope our fans will join us in supporting the team at donington park for the opening race

2065390 como estoy seguro de que usted sabe hay reglas que se establecieron para los medios internacionales que vendr n a pek n china en 2008 y hay temas pol ticamente delicados que el gobierno pidi a los medios extranjeros no cubrir
2065391 es una compa a cuyo accionista mayoritario es el gobierno de la ciudad de pek n
2065392 depende del apoyo y la asistencia de muchos departamentos del gobierno
2065393 si el 7bmc fuera percibido como apoyando un programa internacional cuyas intenciones fueran cubrir cualquiera de los cinco temas prohibidos las repercusiones para el 7bmc y sus clientes ser an desastrosos para el proyecto ol mpico y para cualquier ulterior apoyo a los restantes 26 a os de sociedad
2065394 si ustedes vienen a beijing a cubrir las cuestiones relacionadas con los juegos ol mpicos nos complacer ayudarlos pero si vienen a producir segmentos y noticias sobre cualquiera de los temas prohibidos entonces lo siento pero no podremos ofrecerles nuestro apoyo esta vez
2065395 estamos puramente en una alianza como proveedor de instalaciones y facilitador en china
2065396 s lo podemos reiterar que no conocemos los cinco temas prohibidos sospecho que no los conoc amos cuando el e mail fue enviado hace cinco meses y que todav a no los conocemos

2065402 id say the best part is just being part of the team
2065403 the coaches see us as just as vital as anybody else for someone who has zero athletic ability like myself its nice to be a part of the team
2065404 i cant say enough about the work of our video staff they do a tremendous job for our program
2065405 steven parks lacey wes whaley and the staff are great at their jobs theyre dependable extremely dedicated and very knowledgeable what they do for our football team is absolutely critical to our success
2065406 the best part of the job is definitely game days
2065407 game days are the most exciting part just the atmosphere not only of vanderbilt stadium but all of the other stadiums that we go to visit especially in the sec
2065408 basically anything thats asked of me within reason i can do
2065409 its just a lot of long hours during the season
2065410 they have to tell the computer when a play starts and when it ends
2065411 after a game if it ends at 10 p m i still have about three or four hours worth of work to do so im not getting home until 1 or 2 a m and then have to be back at work the next day
2065412 the coaches dont watch it like we watch a game on tv
2065413 offseason is definitely a lot quieter the summer is our quietest time we all try to take our vacations then and take it easy clean up the office and stuff like that
2065414 weve had people with all kinds of variations of skill sets
2065415 some that dont know much of anything or know a lot about cameras but dont know much about sports know a lot about sports but dont know much about cameras and how they all work
2065416 there were no wounded they stayed behind everything that stayed behind was burnt
2065417 miss my 2 little ones so much but theyre with me in everything i do out here
2065418 even if one of my children committed war crime he should go to court because justice is for all
2065419 they think they give a chance for peace but no they give bashir a chance to kill
2065420 some of my friends stayed away from me while others remained close i believe in what im doing and it gives me more hope for the future
2065421 i answered him that i am helping people and that makes me feel good about myself my parents support me and that is what is important
2065422 if you believe in what you are doing then others will accept it and move on

2065427 i really like pierre dreossi the clubs general manager and i believe that is reciprocal
2065428 at the end of last season he promised me that if there was a good offer he would accept that i could leave
2065429 this offer exists it comes from everton who want to buy me for more than 8 million euros 6 3million
2065430 i owe everything to rennes my formative club but they must understand me in africa i have a family to feed and i am very ambitious
2065431 everton are a very established club in the premier league managed by david moyes a coach who puts trust in youngsters

2065452 it will be interesting to see if we can ease that anxiety whether that helps them to become more open to embracing change in their mathematics instruction
2065453 research says improving critical thinking skills in teachers helps students improve theirs
2065454 the crux of this is that its an individualized plan

2065464 he calls me every day to know whether anyone has spoken to me at real about his future and i always have to tell him that no one has called
2065465 his ambition is to become the best player in the world but he wont achieve that at madrid because they treat him like a normal player
2065466 he didnt like at all the idea of being fourth choice in the plans madrid have had this summer

2065473 christian faith surely must be concerned in some degree with political questions and surely christian belief has affected political forms from age to age and will continue to affect the political modes but to assume that christian dogmata meant to order the soul can be applied without qualification to the multitudinous prudential concerns of the civil social order well that way lies much confusion and violence christian faith may transform this world through working upon the minds and the hearts of many human beings b ut the christian church is no instrument for administering secular justice conducting secular diplomacy or waging war

2065504 sort of like i used to bead and had so much beads and bead gear but a few years back i got rid of it all it just got out of hand but it served me well for quite a few years as in income
2065505 i have a never ending scarf that my children think is hilarious i find i love to knit when my mind is cluttered funny thing is i have no idea how to end it lol i guess it doesnt much matter because ill probably never finish it

2065509 i keep telling myself im going to get back into painting i plan to paint something for my new house and even have a blank canvas waiting for me
2065510 i have also crocheted a little when i was younger and have embroidered a few things i guess the most i every accomplished was with cross stitching i just dont think i am a needle craft type of person
2065511 i love knitting i dont know how to do very much but i find it very relaxing i have tried to learn crocheting but to no avail me and those hooks dont get along lol
2065512 did a bunch of fabric painting a few years back and there are still tubes of paint brushes stencils etc
2065513 i started quilting once and i guess that is still my downfall i still find myself at the fabric store or even walmart checking out different fabrics that would make a cool quilt
2065514 about this time of year the urge to knit becomes very strong maybe this time ill act on it
2065515 i did beaded necklaces for a bit i still knit but i never got beyond the scarf stage i tried crochet once but i never finished even the one granny square i also dont sew anymore
2065516 i would like to return to scrapbooking which has taken a definite hiatus since joining the cult of insanity ive always wanted to take up jewelry making too i dont have enough patience for anything other than writing lately and i need to take advantage of the unblock while i can

2065518 you could say that my writing is was a casual pursuit yet i have never gone a week without writing something since i was 14 jaysus i think i need to get out more or something

2065586 i got one of their phone numbers got them tickets to a few games and ended up talking to them a little bit
2065587 i met them in chicago last week hopped on the bus with them and drove to the next show
2065588 i told them about how i have my band and how i am trying to record and get my stuff out there but it was more of just being there being around that atmosphere and seeing how it is that lifestyle
2065589 they are the real deal to see them in person and learn a couple of things was just really cool
2065590 they all happen to be from buffalo and are huge hockey fans
2065591 they had just as many questions about hockey as i did about music it was pretty cool to fill them in on my lifestyle what i do how fortunate i am to be playing and how much fun i have doing it
2065592 everything is the same it was one of the jokes we had how similar they are
2065593 with the sabres we are a team we are on the road together all the time hanging out and working together with our fans supporting us all the way with the band its the same exact thing they are experts at what they do and have to perform at their top level and have fun with it

2065615 the epas decision today sends a strong message that we must continue moving forward toward sustainable production of advanced biofuels to reduce both our dependence on imported oil and greenhouse gas emissions from transportation and to increase production of biofuels from non food sources
2065616 the renewable fuel standard was designed to move the nation as rapidly as possible toward production of advanced biofuels made from renewable resources
2065617 beyond this the rfs says that advanced biofuels must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 60 percent compared to petroleum gasoline
2065618 moving backward to a time where supplies of corn outpaced demand is not a possibility we applaud the epas decision not to grant the waiver
2065619 many companies have been racing to develop and deploy the technology to meet those requirements
2065620 meanwhile many economists and studies agree that undoing the rfs would not reduce corn and food prices as claimed by those who requested the waiver
2065621 the agricultural and food policy center at texas a amp m university in a study cited by advocates of the waiver concluded earlier this year that relaxing the rfs would not significantly lower corn prices a study by purdue university economists shows that while biofuels have created a new demand for corn about 75 percent of the current rise in corn prices can be attributed to the rapidly rising price of oil bruce babcock a professor of economics and the director of the center for agricultural and rural development at iowa state university has said that the price of corn will rise and fall in direct relation to the price of transportation fuel

2065786 he works hard thats just how he is and i think its good for the team obviously hes a great talent for the offense and we need him here
2065787 i dont care who you are in this game its going to take you a while to get back
2065788 hes coming back quickly but he certainly still has a long ways to go to get to where he wants to be
2065789 i talked with him roughly once a week in the offseason and i know that when it comes time to play football he loves to do that and hell want to be the best he can be
2065790 does that mean we wont have some rocky road ahead hes an emotional person but i think hes here to do a job and do it well
2065791 when he does things right his productivity is second to none in the league when he lets his focus slip it hurts us because one of our best players is underperforming
2065792 its like any team when one of your best performers is underperforming it has an effect on everyone else and when one of your best players is playing well it raises everybody else

2065809 china durante largo tiempo ha so ado con abrir sus puertas e invitar a los atletas de todo el mundo a los juegos ol mpicos de pek n esta noche ese sue o se ha hecho realidad enhorabuena pek n

2065813 this is such a case which leads from dirty looks to death in one hour
2065814 the public have every right to be concerned about the increase growth of this sort of violence
2065815 it is a tragedy that this sort of triviality caused such a young man to lose his life and has caused enduring heartache to his friends and family

2065825 once you know the gene thats responsible you can potentially figure out the proteins that are defective and possibly treat these patients
2065826 until you know what the defect is you cant devise any treatment once youve at least identified a defective gene you can work on potential treatments
2065827 the implications for dogs is that we have the possibility to reduce the frequency of this mutation in the population and in this way immediately avoid new cases of crd caused by this mutation
2065828 for humans the study may help in the identification of the etiology of some cases of crd and the dog could also be an extremely valuable model for the development of new treatment schemes for crd including gene therapy
2065829 in the future if they could use this model for gene therapy to see whether or not they can replace the gene product with a good protein that actually works in the retina and they can restore vision in this dachshund that would be helpful if we were to find same gene defect in humans that would be good news we could potentially use gene therapy in humans to restore vision

2065848 we will not allow bensenville children to be put in harms way without ensuring every necessary measure is taken to prevent long term health risks
2065849 if chicago cannot prove there is an adequate funding mechanism bulldozing our town will be a wasteful unnecessary and cruel burden on the people of bensenville
2065850 there have been no firm agreements or understandings or any kind of concerted work in this regard
2065851 the main thing to remember is that the negotiating track is open it is being pursued there are contacts between the parties
2065852 of course some parties do raise the issue of sanctions from time to time
2065853 we havent set any deadlines ourselves for their response and there is ongoing dialogue
2065854 certainly there is a matter which is going to be discussed by the ministers in september
2065855 more complicated than that as we all know but we do believe that dialogue can continue

2065884 the army treats the shooting at point blank range of a bound man only as inappropriate behaviour it disgraces the values which it pretends to uphold
2065885 this case proves once again that the military judicial system views harming innocent citizens as a public image problem and not as a moral issue
2065886 harming a bound and helpless person is a shameful and cruel act and calls for an appropriately severe response

2065896 archbishop is helping muslim men oppress women say black feminists
2065897 create the space for the most reactionary and even fundamentalist religious leaders to take control of minority communities
2065898 the sentiments recently expressed by the archbishop of canterbury and the lord chief justice concerning sharia law are very telling in the rush to be tolerant or sensitive to religious difference they create the space for the most reactionary and even fundamentalist religious leaders to take control of minority communities and they enable a climate which allows religion to define our roles in both private and public spaces
2065899 their sentiments appear contingent on the false assumption that black and minority cultures are intrinsically opposed to universal human rights principles and that they do not contribute to the body of law based on such principles that now inform the english legal system in doing so they allow religious and cultural contexts to become the overriding framework within which those from ethnic and religious minorities are perceived inevitably drawing on very narrow assumptions about religion and the role of women

2065905 i was a state employee for 15 years before they let me go i was working as a full time employee for one agency and took on a 6 month contract position with another since i was a state employee i was not allowed to benefit financially from contractual work so i took on this project at cost more or less for the experience well others didnt care about no profit no gain and still felt this was a conflict of interest it took a little over a year to appeal their decision meanwhile i broke into the consulting business full time and am making more than i was as a state employee now 18 months later the results of the appeal are in the state board believes that i shouldnt have taken on the side project but feels the punishment was way too severe especially with 15 years of exemplary service they are allowing me to return to state employment in the same capacity as i left but with no back pay now my dilemma i have a growing family do i go back as a state employee and take a cut in my current pay but enjoy health and retirement benefits that i do not have as a consultant or do i take advantage of the significant amount of money that i am earning as a consultant and move on without worry about living from paycheck to paycheck

2065913 we hope that the measures applied by the federal ministry of economy will begin to yield fruit next year
2065914 its a policy decision to be made by the council

2065922 we started to realize the relationship of the bottom of the upper because you have an upper thats holding the foot accurately when you put on firm outsoles they compromise the fit with a compliant moveable outsole you can actually feel the cable all the way around the foot instead of just landing on this hard plank on the bottom of your foot which causes the flywire upper to tent out to the side
2065923 it is a fantastic pitch to bat on there was hardly anything for bowlers it is just that we did not bat well we should have scored more runs
2065924 but i still feel we are very much in the game if we get one or two early wickets in the morning tomorrow we will be right back in the game
2065925 they have a good batting line up one of my favourite players is sachin and it was a big moment for me to take his wicket i am really happy

2065927 il comitato olimpico si complimentato per lidea che io avevo proposto ha spiegato mongelli a news italia press il simbolo dellacqua quindi lattenzione del comitato di pechino stata rivolta al messaggio finalizzato al concetto dellacqua che rappresenta la vitalit e la bellezza della vita e penso che i membri del comitato lo abbiano percepito in maniera particolare
2065928 nelle mie opere ha proseguito mongelli c sempre un avvicinamento alla ricerca su arte e scienza quindi non a caso premi nobel come montalcini e rubbia seguono con attenzione il mio percorso professionale proprio per questa fusione tra arte e scienza
2065929 il rigore fisico matematico che caratterizza le importanti opere di alfio mongelli esaltato dalla libert espressiva che rifiuta ogni schematismo scientifico

2065932 la scelta da parte delle autorit cinesi di una mia scultura dedicata allacqua con cui rappresenter litalia tra i 20 artisti di diverse nazionalit chiamati a realizzare unopera monumentale per arricchire larea delle olimpiadi di pechino 2008 mi riempie di orgoglio

2065939 were starting to see surprises in canadian economic indicators coming in on the downside
2065940 but the key is the employment report its all about the consumer and consumer confidence is driven by the employment outlook and by income of course there are signs now that what had been a very solid support for canadian consumers is fraying around the edges

2065959 we feel theres a serious intention by the american forces for a withdrawal timetable at the very least
2065960 it should not be considered an end to the mehdi army but its a halfway step to dissolving the mehdi army if the u s began to implement a withdrawal timetable we shall complete the path to dissolution
2065961 it is a good step to repair our mistakes especially sectarianism and sectarian killings we are very sorry about these sectarian killings because some parties supported this violence for their own advantage
2065962 to renounce violence and participate peacefully in the iraqi political process
2065963 as of last night the schedule was one of the issues being discussed between the two sides there is no agreement yet but this is what the iraqis are asking for
2065964 if we find this does not happen and the u s forces change their stance over the timetable we can change direction also
2065965 this will not mean ending the ceasefire it will depend on whats going on the ground
2065966 no one is safe today from the negative impact of poor application performance whether youre a gamer a retail outlet or a salesforce com user

2065968 in the past we were managing the infrastructure which really doesnt get into how the application is performing for the end users
2065969 we need to be able to be aware of and see all of the pieces that make up an application and how they affect the end user to understand when performance is going to be impacted he says
2065970 we have had instances in which a performance problem would occur because something had been put on the network such as a network interface card or a port that causes a problem with an application such as voice

2066050 we are only allowed for the charter 866 hours but due to increased popularity and the shortage of guards weve gotten into a situation where weve had to go over and our choices are to reduce our pool hours and program or allow us to go over 866

2066108 while rbs does face the threat of further writedowns and or a uk recession our view is that the company has taken a conservative stance on writedowns and has the benefit of diversification away from the uk
2066109 the first half of 2008 has been as difficult an operating environment as we have encountered for some time presenting both general and specific challenges to rbs
2066110 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market writedowns

2066127 the chinese communist regime cannot use the olympics to persecute its own people
2066128 in the context of preparing the so called successful games they have rounded up over 8 000 falun gong practitioners nation wide in just six months
2066129 what we are witnessing today is a persistent and pervasive assault on human rights in china
2066130 a betrayal of the olympic charter the olympic games and chinas pledge to respect both
2066131 since 2001 the government of china and its agencies have killed thousands of falun gong practitioners without any form of prior trial
2066132 how a country like that could be awarded the olympic games is beyond my comprehension
2066133 its the first time china has hosted the olympic games we are so proud of it
2066134 hopefully we can move right along we have a nice olympics and show the world china is improving
2066135 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
2066136 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
2066137 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
2066138 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery
2066139 as soon as i met him the headache was gone
2066140 god told me it was time to be his wife praise be to god i am his wife now
2066141 i said i couldnt marry an older man but he said it was directly an order from god
2066142 i am now the happiest woman on earth when you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them
2066143 as you sit here if you have any illness i can see it and just remove it

2066150 it would be wise for us not to have those funds flowing through and checks flying around
2066151 everything about noah is so messed up and the evidence of misbehavior is so clear that even if there was something going on that in the end would be considered to be legal and appropriate it just makes no sense for us to do any of it until the authorities have had a chance to sort everything out and make some determinations about it
2066152 i talked with someone from the church group who was there
2066153 the idea of this program always seemed silly to us because we have hundreds of volunteers each month
2066154 theres no reason to hire professional demolition crews to gut houses for old people
2066155 we knew at the time that something weird was going on they wouldnt e mail the lists you had to drive by city hall and pick it up from somebody
2066156 its atrocious that they would take credit for this then financially make taxpayers responsible
2066157 miss doris is paying taxes the city is using her tax money for something that they didnt even do its unbelievable
2066158 however three separate noah contractors including a firm owned by nagins brother in law have billed city hall a combined 5 115 to gut board up and cut grass at the forshey street house
2066159 see im only going to charge a little bit like 350 on a house where i didnt do anything and they aint gonna notice thats how ill get away with it brother in law

2066224 whatever the proper resolution of the extraordinarily important questions presented the public interest clearly favors further consideration of issues before defendants are required to take actions that may forever alter the constitutional balance of separation of powers
2066225 this continuing contempt of congress is another example of the lengths to which this administration will go and how it uses government lawyers to protect its actions from scrutiny and increase its power rather than respect the rule of law

2066227 nancys leadership will move us along the expansive paths recently pursued by foundations in other catholic dioceses in our country
2066228 several of these foundations have already become strong stewards of significant money contributed by people of all faiths and very good sources of funding for serious charitable needs its our aim to become one of them
2066229 this is a time of tremendous growth for the catholic church in north georgia with nancys successful record of working with nonprofit organizations she will be a great asset to the catholic foundation of north georgia
2066230 the needs have grown greater along with the population catholic and otherwise the ability of catholics to respond to the needs of more and more people has grown also thank god
2066231 nancys mission is to lead the foundation in both those areas

2066250 so we have raised our fees chargeable to the buyer and seller to three per cent 1 5 per cent each from the buyer and seller this rise is not a directive from the real estate regulatory agency rera as it does not set commission rates
2066251 in the brokerage market if one agency increases commission rates others will follow the industry is healthy and has grown at an average rate of 40 to 50 per cent in terms of the volume of deals done in the past two years the opportunities as you see are tremendous for a broker in the market
2066252 today 75 per cent of the income earned of a brokerage company goes towards costs
2066253 the percentage of the brokerage commission between the seller and the company can vary
2066254 the market is huge and we deal with only select developers i work with less than 10 developers but i have excellent relations with them built up over the years
2066255 we look forward to rera introducing further regulation in respect of memorandum of understanding agreements for sales lease contracts and general procedures
2066256 and the ratio of salary to commission needs to be set by rera in order to promote team players and commitment to the brokerage industry and provide a transparent and professional service

2066258 lahore will host eight games including the final while karachi will host seven matches and the icc and pcb are working on the revised schedule for the tournament
2066259 not only was the pace of construction slow at the stadium but the icc security consultants had also raised some issues with the location of the venue which is in the middle of a clustered residential and commercial area with some high rise buildings adjacent to the stadium
2066260 the icc has to be handed over the stadium at least two to three weeks before the tournament so that their curator can start preparing the pitches while their broadcasters and sponsors can start installing their products and technology
2066261 although the company carrying out the construction work at the stadium says it would be 80 per cent complete by august 20 but the pcb feels this might not be possible
2066262 the security consultants also noted the close proximity of the city to areas where the security forces are engaged in a battle with militants and also the recent spate of bomb attacks in islamabad and pindi

2066289 i am very struck by the value placed on little models that are never actually confronted with data from the real world
2066290 there is a danger that the macroeconomic models now in use in central banks operate like a maginot line they have been constructed in the past as part of the war against inflation the central banks are prepared to fight the last war
2066291 but are they prepared to fight the new one against financial upheavals and recession the macroeconomic models they have today certainly do not provide them with the right tools to be successful

2066295 i go before the release of all my films and spend 4 5 days in ajmer sharif im able to overcome my nervousness there this time there was no time to go days in advance but on friday when ill be in ajmer sharif it will be the time for a very big festival called chatti sharif i didnt plan it this way but now that ive the opportunity ill be in ajmer sharif throughout chatti sharif on saturday ill be in jaipur to watch my film
2066296 but vipul never interfered hes a smart producer he knows ive 32 years of experience behind me in the industry vipul has only directed three films people are aware of my experience and my last two films were massive hits so when a producer invites me to make a film why would he interfere i hate producers who intrude in my work and anyone who signs me knows it vipul loves and respects me thats why he approached me id love to do another film with him if vipul didnt have confidence in me why would he let me direct hed have done it himself
2066297 what ive made is nothing when compared with mughal e azam whenever i watch that film i feel i should be doing something else how did k asif do it
2066298 ill say only one thing ive made a very good film its a much bigger film than my no entry and welcome but i wasnt thinking of those films while making singh is kinng i didnt want to repeat the earlier formula for the first time ive incorporated action scenes in my cinema i dont like action but because of akshay we had to include it
2066299 a lot of my friends are sardarjis im very fond of them for their lifestyle and daring ive never done a film that would hurt any communitys feelings quite frequently i get rid of potentially funny scenes when i feel theyre offensive i want to distribute love not hatred through my cinema i personally approached major sikh communities to watch singh is kinng they pointed out scenes that were not quite right we recalled akshay kumar from south africa and re shot those scenes then the sikhs were quite happy our intentions cannot be doubted people who saw the film on wednesday say singh is kinng is better than my no entry and welcome were all excited my wife thinks this is my best work to date my children love it thats a relief if people in my home dont like a film how can i expect people outside to like it
2066300 i normally shoot one film at a time its because of my producer vipuls planning that i could complete and release

2066311 realising that i had to set up an it system that was both scalable and robust enough to cope with massive data needs with a limited budget gave me a big headache
2066312 a supplier needed to convince me that they could deliver what they promised i knew intercept were on my wavelength when they explained how the system was setup when it could be delivered and the simple cost per user per month pricing model i liked the aggressive approach to getting things done thats something i can relate to
2066313 we have been using onlinedesktop for some time now and its as reliable as our electricity supply it is always there and its always on we just take it for granted
2066314 i need things done correctly the first time and i want them done with minimal fuss and to high standards of excellence my customers are like that too they do not want to hang around and also want their needs to be fulfilled pretty quickly thats why i think i found a real winner with intercept i can work with them knowing that winning is their passion too

2066343 hedge funds underperformed in july due to sharp reversals in the equity markets during the second half of the month
2066344 one of the most common and profitable themes among managers for the first half of the year short financials and long energy experienced a very sharp reversal in july
2066345 equity managers remain very cautious and entered july with the lowest net exposure in 4 years
2066346 hedge fund managers are very cautious due to u s housing declines poor economic data and higher commodity prices most are unwilling to take a directional bet and are maintaining cash positions in preparation for better future investment opportunities
2066347 given a global economic slowdown the run up in commodities was long in the tooth and most were expecting a pull back at some point in the near term
2066348 however most believe that this is a short term correction in the long term bull trend for commodities which is still intact but with less momentum many believe that the demand for agricultural commodities and oil may continue to outweigh supply for many years to come

2066371 the deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle
2066372 the replacement of complex inner density with a new kind of self evolving under the pressure of information overload and the technology of the instantly available
2066373 is that we now go outside of ourselves to make all the connections that we used to make inside of ourselves
2066374 the next generation will not grieve because they will not know what they have lost
2066375 i feel that much of my life is ebbing away in the tide of minute by minute distraction im not certain what the effect on the world will be but psychologists do say that intense close engagement with things does provide the most human satisfaction

2066386 were now about 4 500 of the 5 000 that we promised and by the end of 2008 im sure in the months ahead well be celebrating 5 000 that will help us take some of the load off the acute care as well as building the acute care capacity itself
2066387 we need to make sure that beds are a bit flexible because you can never say we need exactly so many beds
2066388 we need to look and see different times of year like the winter time when people are definitely sicker with infectious diseases
2066389 were not pointing fingers saying its your fault you need to fix it we need to work together because we want our patients to be taken care of
2066390 the bcma correctly notes that we have been introducing meaningful maximum wait times for specific procedures beginning with cancer treatment and hip and knee replacements
2066391 its important to note that half of all surgeries in british columbia are never wait listed as they are performed on an emergency urgent basis
2066392 the shortage of acute care beds is really affecting the quality of health care
2066393 b c is experiencing difficulties in providing hospital care in a timely manner due in part to significant cuts in the number of acute care beds over the past decade

2066405 we are practicing day in and day out with bowling machines plastic balls in rainy conditions and on turning wicket he is fit and raring to go
2066406 did not make use of the best available evidence and did not make fair or reasonable comparisons of data
2066407 this statement has the character of an admission by responsible civil servants that there are limits to what can be confidently stated with respect to the trust fund and that a history of accounting nonfeasance makes such a substantial error plausible
2066408 we believe we presented a strong compelling case that individual indian trust beneficiaries are entitled to much more than the governments admitted mismanagement of our trust monies over the past 120 years

2066410 series and found him to just really be settling in after a whirlwind summer that swept dramatic changes throughout the organization
2066411 i think theres so much speculation do we have too many forwards not enough on d
2066412 he recited as if hes heard these questions thousands of times daily since summer began
2066413 i think we have to be accountable and accessible to the players and to the fans both on and off the ice we have to make sure that the fans know were doing everything we can to win games and the players have to know that were doing everything we can to give them the bullets to win games
2066414 we got every single player we talked to except brian rolston
2066415 len had 185 points one year in the western league 1989 90 with the kamloops blazers that doesnt happen by accident
2066416 you should have seen his face he was stunned i mean stunned
2066417 i can skate but i dont think anyone at 47 outside of chris chelios feels like they did at 27
2066418 stamkos alexander killorn ty wishart theres about five or six of them out there and the funny thing is theyre the best ones in the camp
2066419 they played for probably a half an hour with nobody in the stands just one guy on five whoever could make it through and then the next guy would go i mean stamkos still he looked like he was twelve just having a good time
2066420 im excited about it its already an amazing arena for concerts
2066421 what i want to do is build the st pete times forum up as one of the premier entertainment establishments in the south
2066422 id like to talk to smitty and fellow bolts goalie olaf kolzig id like for each one to have a real mask and another to donate to the lightning foundation i think between saw fans and hockey fans theyd be really collectible items and i think it would be great for the foundation
2066423 the guys a stone winner and im a big believer in siding with winners
2066424 so if youre a jets fan well theyve got a good team
2066425 what were getting is a little bit of foreclosures thrown in with voluntary home sales
2066426 there seems to be enough of a price decline that buyers are starting to look for bargains
2066427 if the trend continues we could see 1 million properties lost to foreclosure across the country by year end
2066428 consumers waiting on the sidelines may find themselves trying to time the market at its absolute low point
2066429 this timing element and continued uncertainty will likely extend the recovery time in the residential sector
2066430 so right now were definitely feeling the peak in all of those subprime arm resets
2066431 we havent done an analysis to show the correlation between resets and foreclosures but its safe to say as long as housing is in this depreciation path when some of these loans reset some are not going to be able to refinance and some are going to go bad
2066432 were starting to see a ramp up of prime foreclosures in our analysis
2066433 we will know for sure in about three to six months because of the lag time but if you add the slowing economy rising unemployment lower visitor count existing foreclosures and rising interest rates i would say its a very strong and likely chance we will start to see alt a and prime mortgage foreclosures increase dramatically
2066434 while the foreclosure start rates were up for all types of mortgages a reflection of the decline in home prices the magnitude of the national increases is clearly driven by certain loan types and certain states

2066436 in preseason games youre never as good as you think and youre never as bad as you think our first drive offensively was very good good for 16 plays then the fouls got us we cant allow that to happen i thought their defense picked it up after our first drive defensively we did a pretty good job to limit them to three points now all of our seconds and thirds are going to play we were pretty competitive and a lot sharper offensively than we were in our first preseason game a year ago its something to build on weve still got a long way to go
2066437 that was nice we got there and punched it in to score we played it pretty good with the clock damon huard did a good job and our young receivers made some plays and jamaal charles played pretty well
2066438 it couldnt have gone much better for us i think we converted five third downs we got our running game going and hit some timely passes that was what we wanted on the next drive its kind of hard to overcome a holding penalty in our league when youre backed up as far as you were we feel good about what the first group did its something to build on we can still correct a lot of things that we didnt do right
2066439 there is a gate in paradise called ar raiyan and those who observe fasts will enter through it on the day of resurrection and none except them will enter through it it will be said where are those who used to observe fasts they will get up and none except them will enter through it after their entry the gate will be closed and nobody will enter through it

2066442 i dont know why people are blaming the pigeon men they forget that during the war it was the pigeon men that helped to keep things going
2066443 to me the electricity wires are a bigger problem than the peregrine or the hawk is there are more obstacles than just the peregrine or the hawk although they are definitely taking the songbirds out because i see them taking them out of my garden
2066444 i want to know what he has against songbirds and pigeons
2066445 weve been trying to get in touch with with some of these organisations this long time and they dont seem to want to bend at all
2066446 itll be with the responsible groups who are organisations though it wont be with the irresponsible element who are carrying out these illegal activities they arent affiliated to anybody
2066447 i am more than happy to talk to the pigeon men im hoping it will be the start of a build up of understanding between the pigeon men and those responsible for protecting wildlife in northern ireland

2066505 more than half of our survey respondents say today they turn to family friends and neighbors for financial advice in launching hacia adelante we want to instill confidence among our hispanic customers that they should feel comfortable visiting a banking center and speaking with our bilingual associates about their financial needs and goals
2066506 our message is simple bank of america is committed to providing all of our customers with the personalized banking center services and innovative financial solutions they need to meet their financial goals
2066507 the american bankers association study re confirms that many hispanics are skeptical of financial institutions when it comes to meeting their needs we want to reassure all of our customers that we are here to help them achieve their financial goals while keeping their accounts safe and secure

2066512 our embassy in tel avivs contacts with the settler community have been with the goal of setting out the british governments view on this issue and to seek to convince them that settlements are a significant obstacle to peace but you are right that their presence at this event was not helpful and the embassy is reviewing its procedures to ensure that it does not happen in the future
2066513 repeated charges regarding the illegality of israeli settlements must therefore be regarded as politically motivated without foundation in international law politically the west bank and gaza strip is best regarded as territory over which there are competing claims which should be resolved in peace process negotiations israel has valid claims to title in this territory based not only on its historic and religious connection to the land and its recognized security needs but also on the fact that the territory was not under the sovereignty of any state and came under israeli control in a war of self defense imposed upon israel at the same time israel recognizes that the palestinians also entertain legitimate claims to the area indeed the very fact that the parties have agreed to conduct negotiations on settlements indicated that they envisage a compromise on this issue

2066515 if you want to keep lost pounds off daily weighing is critical
2066516 but stepping on the scale isnt enough you have to use that information to change your behavior whether that means eating less or walking more paying attention to weight and taking quick action if it creeps up seems to be the secret to success
2066517 we know that losing weight and keeping weight off is very tough for many people
2066518 however the results of stop regain show that there are definite actions that people can take before their weight begins to creep upward weight control and better health are not one shot deals and this study will help people see that
2066519 the internet intervention worked but the face to face format produced the best outcomes
2066520 both were successful because the message that people got pay attention to your weight then take action to maintain it was effective people were told to take personal control of their health and were given the tools to do it and they kept off the weight
2066521 this suggests that participants in the intervention groups were able to use the information from the scale to make constructive changes in their eating and exercise behaviors
2066522 its further evidence that getting on the scale each day is only part of the solution

2066624 it was my pleasure to be honest there are windows in the dining room but they dont offer a view quite like this
2066625 its what you do when someone shows you the universe right
2066626 i just had a flash of a memory thats all
2066627 i dont i i mean i barely have any money
2066628 i mean not no but you havent come yet i i want to make you come
2066629 you should probably get back to your own quarters before anyone else wakes up
2066630 thank you for last night its been a long time
2066631 janet being able to bring joy and pleasure to others gives me pleasure most people i take to my bed have set up appointments have paid their credits and our encounters have been planned out on paper and in fantasies years in advance last night for the first time i spent a spontaneous evening with a beautiful woman it was one of the most pleasurable evenings ive had in a long time thank you janet
2066632 you could watch over them guide them watch cassandra grow into a woman
2066633 hey didnt see you yesterday we had to settle for some of zoes meat loaf
2066634 maybe we should go to the kitchen capn doesnt like people hanging around while hes doing business
2066635 all right you can help me dig through the pantry and find something edible for dinner tonight
2066636 got a couple of clients on newhall she went to go see one of them
2066637 companions its classy and a necessity it aint like whoring no matter what the captain says
2066638 no im fine with what inara does ive just never known one before its a strange job to have frankly to know your friend is going to work and having sex with people
2066639 well there are stranger jobs out there trust me i once
2066640 gorram huh choo shung tza jiao duh tzang huo double crossed us
2066641 kaylee go to the infirmary get the black box off the counter next to the door theres a red cross on the front bring it here quick
2066642 my favorite aiya shirt too bun tyen shung duh ee dway ro
2066643 if youre a good boy ill sew the damn shirt back together when this is all done
2066644 well doc looks like youre going to earn your passage with more than stew after all
2066645 lucky me captain reynolds hand me that canteen i need to clean this wound before i can do anything else
2066646 hell be fine it will probably leave a nasty scar but considering the alternative
2066647 leave a wave for inara let her know we just had to get out while the getting was good but well be back to pick her up when shes done doing her deeds
2066648 wait a minute captain i get the feeling this was a bit run of the mill for you folks that would imply maybe the cargo you carry isnt always of the legal sort
2066649 depends on what you call legal and what you call run of the mill
2066650 if your crew is endangering the lives of people on this ship i have a right to know
2066651 womans got a point sir if those traders had boarded back there shed have gotten killed right along with the rest of us
2066652 youd sleep with a naquadah reactor under your pillow if you didnt think it would irradiate the sheets
2066653 i uh guess mal told you about our real work
2066654 yeah its something all right do you um take part
2066655 not really if they need to make a fast getaway or need someone to open or close the rear hatch so they can come in im strictly the wheelman girl woman
2066656 captain reynolds seemed to think she would be okay i think she can take care of herself
2066657 yeah but that dont mean i can stop worryin about her its stupid
2066658 no its not stupid in the slightest you love her dont you
2066659 i dont know shes inara shes so kuh eye you know lovely
2066660 its okay to worry about her kaylee im sure she would be touched
2066661 touch my clit its right yes right there yes kaylee
2066662 kaylee youre going to make me come youre such a good girl oh god kaylee
2066663 if i have to tell you that dear girl i have more to teach you than i thought
2066664 im just sorry we had need of your services so soon after your arrival
2066665 from the looks of it your ship might require a full time physician on board
2066666 perhaps you would like to give it some thought you did say you had no particular destination why not end your journey where youre needed where youre wanted
2066667 when were not abusing your medical expertise well have you shackled to the kitchen stove for dinner
2066668 get out of there captain youve done your disservice to humanity today by doing crime no need to spread your sins to the dinner table
2066669 long as shes cooking she can say whatever she wants as pretty as she wants
2066670 so what story would you like to hear about earth that was tonight
2066671 oh thatll take the trip to sihnon and back there were so many different countries and cultures that you could feel like you were on an alien planet without ever leaving the earth
2066672 i cant imagine that spend your whole life on one rock the one you just happened to be born on and never even visit another planet i wouldnt survive
2066673 to the moon and back and even then it was a trial big gorram suits no artificial grav people must have been throwing up right and left
2066674 well not everyone was tied to the earth there were a few who got a chance to explore other worlds the special ones
2066675 there was a device you could use it to travel from one world to the next with a single step
2066676 but only because she was imagining i was you she loves you inara and i know you see it because you love her too
2066677 i cant kaylee is part of the crew if i were to cross that line i would never
2066678 inara lines dont matter theyve never mattered if a line is whats keeping you from doing something you desire with all your heart then cross it the happiest moments of my life occurred because i went where people said i wasnt allowed i trained to be a soldier i became a doctor i fell in love with a woman in the military
2066679 ive spent so much time making a business out of it im not sure i would know how to actually court someone
2066680 i wasnt sure if i was allowed here or not
2066681 we shouldnt not in inaras shuttle she would get mad
2066682 inara said she was very close now standing right in front of her
2066683 its all right if you climax early we have all night
2066684 you can come kaylee you can come and then we can take the rest of the night slow i want you to
2066685 maybe you should thank janet for bringing us together like this
2066686 hey there you are we were starting to worry youd fallen overboard
2066687 wouldnt necessarily call it dinner how about kaylee and inara you happen to know where they got off to
2066688 kaylee was feeling a little under the weather inaras taking care of her in fact i was just going to take them some soup
2066689 aw thats too bad let me know if there needs to be some inoculations fore we hit dyton
2066690 you shouldve heard where she wanted to put this thing
2066691 dearest samantha its been a while since i wrote to you ive been spending my time aboard this amazing ship with these outstanding people meeting kaylee and inara seeing their love for each other it made me ache for you i miss what we had sam and whats keeping us apart rules i swore to you once i was done following orders im done running if it takes the rest of my life if i have to struggle until my last breath just to see you one more time before i die then it will be worth it ill find you sam ill be with you again even if it takes everything i have
2066692 besides this way youre getting there during the start of winter rather than the summer summer on sihnon whoo thats not something you forget quick
2066693 you remind me so much of someone i used to know
2066694 shes brilliant she could tear apart an engine she had just seen for the first time and put it back together in an hour and more often than not it would work better than before
2066695 a whole hour what did she do with the other forty five minutes
2066696 thats exactly what she would have said her name was sam
2066697 sure we cant convince you to stay your skills are obviously necessary in the kitchen and in the infirmary
2066698 i would but theres someone i need to see again
2066699 yeah well you know just bein neighborly or captain ly or um
2066700 do yourself a favor though find a doctor who will stay i cant bear the thought of someone on this ship getting hurt and no one being around to fix them
2066701 hey no reason you have to walk hop into the mule zoe and ill take you as far as the town center least we can do for all those meals you cooked us
2066702 i thought those meals were in exchange for passage aboard your ship
2066703 but when we enjoy the passengers company we offer a refund sometimes a small one
2066704 im poor enough to appreciate that thank you captain reynolds
2066705 zoe stop sayin good bye to that hun dan husband of yours or were leaving without ya
2066706 im leavin too you gonna say good bye to me
2066707 maam i cannot in good conscience let you go without a warning
2066708 no hope of rescue no assurance anything is out there but the unending blackness of space i know im well aware of the dangers
2066709 with all due respect there are easier ways to commit suicide maam
2066710 right well i wish you luck maam may god help you because at this point the alliance is taking its leave very few ships have the energy reserves to make it out this far and still make it back home if you insist on going forward
2066711 she is alive but only just barely her ship has no more power and she has run out of supplies even if the ship had more power she would never make it to the closest inhabited system the world where we left her is too far away and there is nothing ahead of her but empty space for thousands of light years
2066712 please oma after what her people have done for us surely we can bend the rules
2066713 perhaps it is time we put the rules aside what good has come from them we have watched so much evil done witnessed so many deaths that could have been prevented the humans of earth are worthy of our assistance of our friendship we must help her it is because of us she was stranded is she to be punished now because her love was too great
2066714 we should let this ship die let it sink in starlight
2066715 i read your notes they were in your satchel they were beautiful janet
2066716 i thought we were going to come out with the same effort we had in the second game i didnt think we played really bad but they buried their chances and made us pay at the end of one we were down 7 0
2066717 we really worked hard through the year taking the guys to the next level and at the end the difference was like night and day

2066778 our answer would be to use a reusable shopping bag
2066779 there is a tremendous number of bags used everyday just think about all the stores you go in and buy one little thing and they put it in a plastic bag just say no thanks i dont need a bag
2066780 nothing has gotten peoples attention like 4 dollar a gallon gas plastic bags are made from oil
2066781 ireland taxes people who use the bags and have eliminated 95 of the plastics distributed some countries have outright banned them and thats what theyve done in san francisco
2066782 if you are going to use plastic bags then think about recycling those bags like here at the recycling center or stores around town will take bags for recycling

2066824 this is a light steamed pudding that my father alejandro urbina loved its easy to make can be made ahead of time and is not as heavy as many christmas puddings

2066831 if its true that russian troops and armaments have been sent to georgia it means that we are in a state of war with russia
2066832 youve been following me around like a hall monitor i get the feeling im absent without leave or something what gives
2066833 ive been trying to figure out the secret of your magnetic charm
2066834 your charm your inherent attractiveness whatever tell me colonel must you make a pilgrimage to the blarney stone every year to renew your gifts or was once enough or did your fairy godmother deed you with the power of attraction at your christening
2066835 ive been trying to figure out what makes you so impossibly desirable and its been driving me nuts because let me tell you the sum parts do not add up to the whole and that is not only blatantly unfair but it makes no sense either
2066836 your appearance it simply does not make sense okay for starters you have the oddest shaped ears ever your clothes never seem to fit you properly always bunching up at the elbows or ankles you are disproportionately long through the torso and you always look as though you are at least a day overdue for a shave even if you last shaved three hours ago
2066837 because the amount of attention that your hair receives borders on the ludicrous and for gods sake its only hair everyone has some and everyone and i mean everyone eventually loses theirs and your eyes well when you get too tired you get bags under them and they are the color of a muddy pond so why everyone waxes poetical over your hazel eyes is beyond me and you cant stand up straight to save your life
2066838 thats just it empirically this should not add up to a picture of hotness but it does and thats the part that i cant figure out that somehow all these odd components should en masse exceed expectations and result in a package that makes women titter in your presence and men want your approval
2066839 jeannie implied that i should ask katie to marry me because i wasnt likely to get a better offer because i was no john sheppard
2066840 but that seems like a pretty stupid reason to ask someone to marry them
2066841 and shes wrong you know about your not being a good catch
2066842 well of course shes wrong that goes without saying um how exactly is she wrong
2066843 can see that your uh component parts arent anything to sneeze at either
2066844 i mean just look at you youve got the most amazing hands especially when theyre in motion i bet you were a better pianist than your teacher ever gave you credit for and theres nothing muddy about your eyes you only see that kind of blue on a clear day at altitude
2066845 and you fill out your clothes just fine you should wear t shirts more often as a matter of fact i could watch you crawl under consoles all day long cause the view from the rear is kinda hot
2066846 so dont let jeannie get to you if you want to marry katie then ask her to marry you but only because you really want to marry her

2066853 internal journey from stardom to losing everything and then the journey to rebuilding his life
2066854 he was very emotional and my dad and i were crying with him when we filmed this it was like seeing the real event happen again the acting in this scene was really magnificent
2066855 while filming i just sat there with tears in my eyes fortunately when i looked around me i realised that everyone else on the sets were crying as well
2066856 it was incredibly tough in a sense it felt like i went through my own king commission at a stage
2066857 the international cricket council were happy for us to continue knowing that the csa endorsed it
2066858 i think they were happy to see that we did not choose to try and uncover any more match fixing dirt rather we chose to tell the story of hansies internal journey
2066859 youd like to win them all but we didnt win the idea is improving between the first and second game
2066860 there are a lot of things to correct and a lot of things to work on thats why you play these games
2066861 that was a missed assignment by a young tight end that caused him to throw the ball in an area where he was supposed to be and the kid wasnt there
2066862 i wish he would have had a chance to finish
2066863 i told myself before the game to try to have fun relax and enjoy the game
2066864 a lot of things have happened to me over the last couple of years i was just trying to go out there and make some plays and see what happened after that its not that ive lost confidence in myself but you always wonder if you can go out and still do this it was good to go out there and feel comfortable that was the biggest thing
2066865 the ball was underthrown he came back went up in the air and got the ball with the defenders all around him that was good
2066866 he showed some real enthusiasm and some real desire to get to the end zone with the ball i liked what i saw with the way he played tonight
2066867 ive been waiting for this moment for a long time
2066868 this year my goal is to not be on the practice squad my goal is to make the 53 man roster and slowly build off of that any chance that comes my way i have to make that play i want to make sure the quarterbacks keep their confidence in me and thats going to make the coaches keep their confidence
2066869 when i got back to the sideline everyone was making fun of me because i should have broke that last tackle to tell you the truth i was kind of tired but that was my chance to make a play to stand out and thats what i was going to do david carr put a nice ball there so you have to catch it
2066870 he did the same things he has done in training camp he made a tackle for a loss and made plays in the secondary
2066871 chase blackburn played many more plays than he was scheduled for because of the goff injury i shook his hand and said that after the game and he said he was glad to get a chance to play which is what you want to hear
2066872 obviously giving up seven points on the first drive is never a good thing
2066873 we did a good job against the run detroit ran for only five yards on the drive with the big pass plays down the field we have to work on that but guys are running around and had a lot of energy thats a good thing weve got more work to do thats why you play the preseason
2066874 we got off to a slow start which is not what we really wanted to do
2066875 throwing the ball wasnt very solid at first during the second drive we got a couple first downs and moved the ball we were able to change field position we still have some work to do and thats what the preseason is all about getting the kinks out and finding out what we need to work on
2066876 to be honest i felt like playing more i didnt want to get out of the game we played the run very well they came out and did a couple things like the bootleg that we need to get better on there is plenty of work still to do
2066877 its very unfortunate for a young guy who has worked his tail off and done very well in camp
2066878 they ran the ball on a weave play and me and the fullback met
2066879 i guess i must have just bent or twisted a little bit different nothing felt unusual about it until i got up and it was a little bit sore it felt a little bit different well just have to see how it goes ill have to get in there with the trainers and when they say im good to go then im good to go
2066880 his motivation in doing it was to play the futures market so that after the pipeline blew up and the price of oil increased he could make whatever profit on it
2066881 that shows at least in his mind that it was going to be a significant enough impact to affect the financial markets in a way that he would enrich himself
2066882 on its face it sounds like an extremely serious charge on the other hand the only person who had the capability of carrying out this scheme was a convicted felon government informant working with atf
2066883 all of the activity in the united states was to be carried out by the government informant and all of this happened with the governments knowledge

2066924 for next year s 30th anniversary of we found more than 10 minutes of deleted scenes and alternate endings that no one has seen before and we re putting that only on the blu ray version
2066925 the standard def version will be at a lower price but we are really trying to trade people up to blu ray we are seeking out our assets that we can apply to blu ray to encourage consumers to step up
2066926 it should be the best selling set that we ve ever done on blu ray
2066927 we want to keep adding to the format and bd live gives us this whole new ability to reinvigorate attraction to the title
2066928 i think at the absolute minimum blu ray customers should get at least everything that s available on the dvd release
2066929 after you put in high def audio and video since that is the focus you might not have as much space on the blu ray as you did on a standard def two disc special edition
2066930 we really take a good better and best approach with our product assortment
2066931 single is good two disc better and the blu ray should always be your best product it might not include everything from the standard dvd but it should be considered the best product
2066932 and you re already getting a price premium with the blu ray version

2066942 mijn eerste milieuactie vlakbij het binnenhof stamt uit 1985 en was een inbraak in het ministerie van economische zaken
2066943 minister van aardenne kwam in het nauw de actie was een groot succes niemand heeft ooit geweten wie er in deze actiegroep zaten duyvendak neemt afstand van zijn actiemiddelen van 23 jaar geleden
2066944 het nieuws over de inbraak is voor groenlinks dan ook geen verrassing aldus nijhof
2066945 wij zeggen tegen alle mensen in nederland wij maken wetten en u dient zich daar aan te houden als je dan als kamerlid zegt ik heb ingebroken dus ik ben een inbreker en ik heb documenten gestolen dus ik ben een dief en ik ben daar nog trots op ook dan vind ik dat g nant
2066946 als een bedrijf ook maar de schijn heeft dat het zich niet aan de regels houdt dan is meneer duyvendak de eerste die de minister naar de kamer roept hoe kan je dat doen als je aangeeft dat je eerst zes jaar lang je mond hebt gehouden over waar je zelf de wet hebt gebroken en dan niet zegt het is 20 jaar geleden en met schaamrood op de kaken geef ik dit toe nee hij spreekt van een succes dat is toch niet met elkaar te rijmen

2067033 rather than being dominated by rural farmers tropical deforestation is increasingly driven by major industries especially large scale farming mining and logging
2067034 although this trend is pretty scary its also much easier to target a handful of global corporations than many millions of poor farmers

2067041 the storage needs in computing today have grown tremendously as opposed to a few years ago more and more people need massive storage to store a large music or video collection some just need to read through a pile of drives to see if their functional others need the flexibility of swapping drives in and out without having to break out the tool kit and seat it in an enclosure or mount it in a chassis with the changing face of computing someone needed to come up with a fast easy hot swappable method of docking hard drives to a desktop or laptop that doesnt involve seating it in an enclosure or case yet provide enough protection to read or write to the drive then move on to the next drive easily thermaltake decided to fill that need and designed their blacx line of docking stations we felt the need for this type of storage so when we got the chance to test the thermaltake blacx se we were ready to see if it would fit the bill

2067049 falling food prices and somewhat larger reductions than normal in the summer sales are the main reasons behind the significant reduction in inflation
2067050 the price of commodities on world markets fell by more in july than in any month since 1980
2067051 the july inflation figure was helped by the fact that the impact of the recent interest rate increase from the ecb was not as large as expected
2067052 the external factors of high food and energy prices have been the main drivers of irish inflation over the past year the annual cost of energy imports per household has doubled from 1 700 in 2004 to 3 400 in 2007 with further increases coming through in 2008 this revenue has now left our shores and to attempt to compensate ourselves for this loss through inflation linked wage increases is unrealistic and would have long term damaging consequences for our economy
2067053 careful stewardship of the economy has positioned us well to weather the current economic storm
2067054 since djamel has been at guantanamo bay his whole family has been living a nightmare our mother who hasnt seen him in 18 years is very sick and hopes to see him before she dies that hope is the one thing that has kept her alive since our father died in april 2007 our father also hoped to hold djamel in his arms before he left us but he didnt have the chance and he departed with this dream unfulfilled as for djamel he was devastated when he learned the sad news that the father who loved him so much passed away the whole family anxiously awaits djamels return to us
2067055 while the supreme courts decision in boumediene restores mr amezianes right to habeas the fact remains that he is still sitting in his cell in guant namo without charge deprived of any semblance of meaningful review of his detention for over six years and with no remedy under u s law for his torture and other violations there must be a public accounting for all that mr ameziane has suffered at the hands of the u s government appealing to this international body is a way to push for such an accounting
2067056 guant namo bay has become a global symbol of impunity and inhumanity now an international body will have the opportunity to demand that the united states hold accountable those responsible for mr amezianes torture and abuse
2067057 i had the impression that my head was sinking in water simply thinking of it gives me the chills
2067058 have you ever wondered why americans still think they are free you will be really perplexed as to why they can think this after listening to this broadcast the declaration of independence has been set aside in its complaints against the crown as americans enjoy task masters over them the likes of which the american colonists would have never dreamed possible the strong delusion has over taken the vast majority posing as patriots
2067059 i wouldnt look for the decline of the church of england in state sponsorship the episcopal church in the us is declining too both are declining because they dont believe in anything except socialism
2067060 the same thing socialists are deluded about that their fantasy of a better world will come true if only they believe
2067061 on the other hand capitalism and the modern liberties we enjoy today came from the very religious protestants and catholics of the 16th century
2067062 i sense a paradox here if religion begins to wither away if it is embraced by the state and socialism begins to whither away if it is embraced by the state e g the soviet union and maybe china and if religion forced to fend for itself in the market gets stronger then will forcing socialism out of government cause it also to become stronger
2067063 i sense a paradox here if religion begins to wither away if it is embraced by the st
2067064 the same thing socialists are deluded about that their fantasy of a better world will come

2067074 this study demonstrates how the plasticity of the human brain can work for the benefit of remedial learning
2067075 we are at the beginning of a new era of neuro education
2067076 with the right kind of intensive instruction the brain can begin to permanently rewire itself and overcome reading deficits even if it cant entirely eliminate them

2067080 were patted down at a significantly higher rate than would be expected
2067081 im not convinced we have the trust and respect of the entire community
2067082 we as an organization were very very concerned about these numbers we have some issues we need to work on
2067083 the african american community has felt like this has been going on for quite some time
2067084 we all want a positive outcome we all want positive change
2067085 i like that many of the structures are safe for little ones to climb and dont have high drop offs
2067086 in these hard economic times many hospitality enterprises are resorting to workforce reductions often without a clear understanding of how that will impact the guest
2067087 its crucial to a companys bottom line that the streamlined team remains motivated to deliver the productivity needed to defend margins by introducing a cost effective version of employee metrix we look forward to helping more hospitality companies manage through tough times and cultivate employees who are engaged in delivering the excellent service that leads to improved performance and profits
2067088 the rest just show up and go through the motions or worse they are actively disengaged
2067089 by measuring what matters to employees and identifying opportunities to connect employees to a vision and mission hospitality companies of all sizes can cost effectively improve service and reduce staff turnover
2067090 with the launch of em express hospitality companies that previously could not afford a top of the line engagement tool will now will be able to capture and act on employee feedback and as a result improve customer loyalty and the bottom line
2067091 farstar is honored to be included in the collin 60 with so many outstanding local companies

2067097 i know reasonable human beings of which i am one are not renowned for paying attention to the original bible languages but it isnt rocket science to discover that the two hebrew words meaning man and death imported into all translations of the bible as meaning man amp death actually mean that
2067098 woe to those who call evil good and good evil
2067099 thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind it is abomination morally disgusting an abhorrence
2067100 if you defy us youll wind up outcast like these
2067101 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press
2067102 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2067103 mr mcgreevey is not seeking employment because he does not need it to sustain himself
2067104 its hard to imagine a more favorable ruling for jim mcgreeveys position
2067105 although the victimization continues i am stronger for the experience
2067106 it appears the banks debt will not be paid from the sale of the assets
2067107 the banks will suffer a substantial deficiency and therefore theres no chance of creditors getting a dividend hence shareholders will not have any likelihood of a return
2067108 there are no plans for major structural changes to the business while the sale process is under way
2067109 still hopeful that we could craft a solution that would meet with the approval of the banks
2067110 time was against us despite everyones best efforts we just couldnt get enough of the turnaround happening fast enough
2067111 but we did give it a red hot go i did also say that whilst there were no guarantees of success that you had my 100 per cent commitment and that of the whole executive team that if we didnt get there it wouldnt be from lack of hard work
2067112 great result for the afp customs and all the investigating officers involved
2067113 theyre not going to force me to resign ive done nothing wrong im going to fight this to the end
2067114 the only ones who are visibly relishing their prospects in this crisis are the terrorists of and the taliban who thrive in states of political anarchy and economic dysfunction
2067115 i say to the commercial banks in australia that they have a responsibility to ensure that action by the reserve bank is reflected in the interest rate posture adopted by those commercial banks
2067116 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at the time
2067117 we will do as much as we can to pass on as much of the interest rate cut as we can
2067118 our position is we want to reduce interest rates to customers as quickly as possible as our funding costs allow
2067119 if they do not receive the full benefit of what the reserve bank has intended then in a way thats subverting what the reserve bank is trying to do through its monetary policy
2067120 we have seen in the us what happens if you dont have a solid banking industry
2067121 therell have to be a full moon and some bizarre turnaround for this to become a political contest
2067122 more worryingly for the liberals is that internal labor party polling during the last election showed that costello was perceived as out of touch and arrogant by the majority of the electorate further costello was seen as one of the driving forces behind work choices
2067123 as for his role as treasurer i think that history will show that he ignored 20 rba warnings on inflation that australians suffered from 10 straight interest rate rises under his watch and that government spending was out of control
2067124 peter costello is part of the problem he cant be part of the solution his legacy is inflation at 16 year highs and work choices thats peter costellos legacy
2067125 ill only buy the book if its got a chapter in it from peter costello that talks about how he made inflation hit 16 year highs if hes got that chapter in there and if he fesses up to the fact that 10 interest rate rises in a row is slowing the economy ill definitely buy the book
2067126 well im pleased to see our efforts to reduce elective surgery waiting times is starting to have an impact in central queensland
2067127 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2067128 the more we can mobilize this community the fewer patents that will actually be granted
2067129 whatever happens in the patent reform world in the next u s administration is great but we have to act now to stop the granting of patents that threaten linux and open source in general
2067130 a production environment where we educate and train people to do this well work with them to make sure its put in a form that is acceptable
2067131 those are kind of the key areas to linux as it moves forward
2067132 the exploitation of ill people who are helpless in the face of the demand to inform and report on their relatives acquaintances and others constitutes intolerable intimidation and a moral problem of serious magnitude

2067139 daaronder vallen natuurlijk ook de culinaire eigenaardigheden van een land daar zul je soms aan moeten toegeven zoals wij een haring aan zijn staart beetpakken en rauw in onze keel laten glijden zo beschouwen ze in adjudana de kop van het schaap als een delicatesse en dan vooral de ogen
2067140 de rol van vrouwen in adjudana is wat meer op de achtergrond maar in de eigen culturele context net zo belangrijk als die van de nederlandse vrouw dit zie je ook terug in de verschillen in opvoeding tussen jongens en meisjes
2067141 jullie moeten in de eerste plaats dicht bij jezelf blijven
2067142 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2067143 we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight

2067145 we will not allow their deaths to go unpunished those responsible will receive a deserved punishment
2067146 the number of refugees is growing a humanitarian crisis is looming

2067162 id just sit here for hours and just look around at whats around me and enjoy it
2067163 weve got a real jewel here and i hope weve got enough sense to protect it and take care of it
2067164 weve picked up as much as 70 tons at a time everything from styrofoam and plastic bottles to car batteries bed frames and even a firearm

2067175 what i tell people to do when they get caught in these situations is what my kids say chillax it means chill out and relax
2067176 it used to be that in exchange for loyalty to a company you got security
2067177 in todays environment where no matter how good you are you could be let go at any time people should begin to consider multiple sources of revenue
2067178 for wall street junkies its a way to still be very engaged with the financial services industry while working for a company in a different industry
2067179 they would highly value people who could help them weed through the opportunities to investigate possible wrongdoings of a firm

2067199 some people have reported images more than 30 hours ago and the images are still there
2067200 this is completely unacceptable and google must address these flaws immediately the longer an inappropriate image is available the more likely it is being downloaded and thereby taken out of googles control
2067201 theyve taken it off now but it took two days of repeated requests and i only managed to get it taken off because i guessed google spokesman rob shilkins email address so i got in direct contact with him

2067232 since last friday house republicans have stood with the american people in an unprecedented nationwide protest against speaker pelosis decision to adjourn the house for the rest of the summer without a vote on the energy solutions americans are demanding
2067233 thanks to the leadership of reps mike pence lynn westmoreland tom price and others house republicans have waged this protest not only in congressional districts across america but on the house floor as well tomorrow i will return to the capitol to rejoin the floor protest that has been carried on by dozens of our colleagues for the past week republicans will not rest until the american people have been heard and speaker pelosi has allowed an up or down vote on the energy reforms our nation needs

2067237 we were very disappointed to hear that after all of your efforts our visas were revoked due to undisclosed security concerns we do not understand why and we do not understand what changed
2067238 they gave us the visas on july 30 and two days later we were told the visas were not valid
2067239 it was a great shock we had hoped to complete our studies especially after we were granted the visas we were packing our bags
2067240 for me a lot of the impulse came out of being labeled an international anarchist when in fact im a christian democrat
2067241 it just has to change without forgetting where it came from
2067242 uh yeah at this point its a good possibility that we no longer have any idea what we are doing
2067243 its a low buck performance car our research has shown that there are actually members of the middle class that like to go fast too who knew

2067250 part of the whole and whether he writes his notices fast or slow short or long is not really important has he an image of how a theatre could be in his community and is he revising this image around each experience he receives how many critics see their job this way
2067251 it is for this reason that the more the critic becomes an insider the better i see nothing but good in a critic plunging into our lives meeting actors talking discussing watching intervening i would welcome his putting his hands on the medium and attempting to work it himself
2067252 oh no those are professional critics and im just little old me with my little blog
2067253 i love you ill see you when i get home those were the last words i heard from him
2067254 he went in and he took a shower and actually put a suit and tie and the whole works on and i figured well if youre going to that extreme so will i
2067255 so i put on a long dress and we went out to dinner and as soon as dinner was over he proposed
2067256 came to the door realized the front door was locked but i could hear the tv on which kind of threw me off because if he had gotten up to turn the tv on he would have unlocked the door knowing i was coming home
2067257 and i had my arms full of groceries still groceries in the truck and walked in to set them on the table and thats when i found him
2067258 trying to get on with my life but in the same respect i cant all i have is the visions of what i saw when i came home that morning

2067264 with the raising of the australian flag our athletes have symbolically turned a little piece of beijing into australia and signalled our arrival at the games to the rest of the world
2067265 in view of current unprecedented market conditions we are accessing other pre existing funding liquidity sources procuring new sources and accelerating the integration of our mortgage company with the bank
2067266 while we believe we have adequate funding liquidity the situation is rapidly evolving and the impact on the company is unknown
2067267 we also believe that the challenges facing the industry should ultimately benefit countrywide as the mortgage lending industry continues to consolidate
2067268 we believe that the sheer mass of countrywide as well as its significant deposit base makes it unlikely that regulators would let cfc fail from a near term perspective we remain comfortable with cfcs funding profile
2067269 managements optimistic comments notwithstanding we remain concerned that we could be in the early stages of a significant housing recession if not depression
2067270 we still believe that cfcs 46 billion in highly reliable funding should help them through this difficult time and market consolidation should lead to a strong position in the future
2067271 we continue to believe that cfc will survive in the current mortgage crisis
2067272 certainly this is going to refocus the bank of canadas attention on the growth side of the economy
2067273 up to now recent comments have been sort of highlighting the risk to inflation but with this kind of employment report its going to make clear that there is risk on the growth side as well
2067274 as human beings its only natural to be thinking about the opportunity of winning back to back titles
2067275 but we are just trying to keep our focus our whole playoff run weve been telling the players to live by the clich one game at a time
2067276 every game we went into we knew we were going to get the other teams best game that can be physically and emotionally draining not only that we play in such a tough conference that your regular season schedule is going to be difficult regardless if any team is singling you out
2067277 it is a little bit smaller in terms of capacity but the fans are right on the field and they get much more enjoyment from our new venue
2067278 the youth system is something new to us but something we are very excited about
2067279 we hope to create a great feeder system through our ranks as we have a great talent pool of young soccer players in texas
2067280 felix has such raw skill that it is a pleasure to watch
2067281 he is a humble kid who just knows how to finish
2067282 we have great media exposure here in laredo and it creates an atmosphere where the top players want to come and play
2067283 our success does the recruiting for us as we have top players contacting us and inquiring about open roster spots on our team
2067284 they are big fast and aggressive while we play more of a creative latin america manner of soccer this will be a true contrast in styles

2067334 en los entrenamientos trabajamos generalmente sobre nosotros mismos y del rival hacemos algo m s espec fico el d a anterior y el mismo d a del partido esto es lo que vamos a hacer con grecia l gicamente cosas nuestras que estamos trabajando nos sirven para grecia y para todo
2067335 lo que todav a no s como solucionar es el d a de alemania porque si tenemos que hablar el d a anterior y el d a del partido no vamos a tener que levantar a las cuatro de la ma ana porque es la primera vez que vamos a jugar a las nueve
2067336 somos conscientes de que lo estamos haciendo bien y de que lo hemos hecho bien pero tenemos que hacerlo bien de ahora en adelante y a n as est la dificultad de los rivales el primer rival grecia es indiscutiblemente muy dif cil
2067337 lo estoy viviendo como lo tiene que vivir un entrenador ocupado en su equipo y en los rivales con la m xima ilusi n y sabiendo que tenemos detr s a toda espa a y que el momento del baloncesto espa ol es bueno pero hay que refrendarlo con hechos no con palabras
2067338 este equipo tiene calidad el momento del baloncesto espa ol es muy bueno y hay mucha calidad vamos a intentar aprovechar esta calidad para poder seguir diciendo lo mismo despu s de los juegos porque sabemos que las cosas hay que demostrarlas haci ndolas no habl ndolas
2067339 son muy listos jugando son muy vivos ese tipo de jugador que est pendiente de todo se desenvuelven en ese nivel especialmente dimitris diamantidis y theodoros papalukas luego tienen jugadores muy grandes que son tiradores de fuera eso nos crea problemas ese juego inteligente y los apoyos que tienen en ioanis burusis costas tsartsaris y antonis fotsis capaces de defender dentro y tirar desde el per metro hace m s peligrosos a los exteriores
2067340 es cierto que espa a gan a grecia en madrid con muchas dificultades en la semifinal del europeo a falta de tres minutos bamos perdiendo ellos adem s de la preparaci n han tenido competici n el preol mpico lo que han demostrado lo han demostrado en competici n oficial y nosotros en amistosos
2067341 se puede contar con todos los jugadores ya que algunos que han tenido alg n problema muscular como ra l l pez o alg n problema articular como juan carlos navarro est n bien
2067342 hemos llegado al nivel que quer amos eso ahora hay que demostrarlo pero es el nivel que quer amos para empezar los juegos el primer partido de una competici n tiene un plus de mentalidad m s dif cil es muy importante el resultado pero hay que convenir que queremos seguir mejorando durante los juegos y que el primer objetivo es clasificarnos entre los cuatro primeros descargamos la tensi n en cada partido individual no ser igual si alcanzamos los cruces
2067343 lo que m s he notado de giannakis es su profundo amor por el baloncesto lo he notado no solamente cuando me enfrentaba con mi equipo al suyo sino una vez que le tuve en una selecci n europea jugamos un partido en croacia y ya le encantaba el baloncesto el estilo de grecia m s que el suyo es el que se adapta al tipo de jugadores que tienen a ese baloncesto inteligente

2067349 while kulemin is unlikely to ever develop into a top line scoring sniper his upside is that of a very capable third line checking forward who would be able to fill in on the top lines in case of injury
2067350 a typical workhorse who works hard and gives it 100 at any place on the ice does not possess a huge upside but is a safe choice who will deliver well in the role described above but will never become a top line forward in the nhl
2067351 i dont know if id be so quick to put a tag on kulemin heading into the nhl
2067352 to automatically suggest he wont be a big scorer may be a safe assumption but its impossible to predict how he might respond to a leading role with the leafs
2067353 i really like the way hes learned to effectively use his size in some ways just watching him out there he looks a lot like evgeni malkin but i agree that he doesnt have malkins hands to expect that hell carry his scoring exploits from the russian league into the nhl is probably a stretch but i think toronto fans are going to like this kid and i believe new coach ron wilson will really help him adjust to north america and the nhl

2067379 sellel ajal kui ma n dalap evad tagasi gruusiasse l ksin toimus just esimene t sisem intsident kui grusiinide k lasid hakati massiivselt tulistama ja gruusia vastas nii suurt kitule kui ka snaipritulega
2067380 nii palju kui ma oletada oskan siis gruusia pool lootis selle tegevusega v hemasti m neks ajaks rahu saavutada
2067381 r kisin ka gruusias olles nii parlamendi esimehe nino burd anadze kui ka president mihhail saaka viliga ja ka nemad lootsid et l una osseetia pool saab aru et kui nad tulistavad siis tulistatakse neid vastu
2067382 see oli ammu teada et olukord v ib pingestuda seda on ka gruusia president varem korduvalt v lja elnud et kui gruusia k lade vastu alustatakse r nnakuid teravneb olukord paraku l una osseetia pool seda tegi
2067383 president langetas selle otsuse retult keerulises olukorras soovides saavutada vaherahu see avaldus oli rmiselt dramaatiline mina j lgisin presidendi esinemist hotellis viibides kus hotelli t tajad keerasid k ik televiisorid cnni pealt kohalikule telekanalile et saaks presidendi k net kuulata
2067384 kuid gruusia initsiatiivi ei soovinud ei venemaa ega l una osseetia pool j rgida kuid ma kaldun arvama et venemaa kes seda konflikti on kogu aeg hutanud ei olnud samuti huvitatud selle konflikti nii tormilistest arengutest igal juhul on venemaa rahuvalvajad kaotanud nende l una osseetia paramilitaarsete v i militaarsete henduste le kontrolli
2067385 ega siin muud v imalust pole kui istuda l bir kimislaua taha ja seda on gruusia pool korduvalt soovinud kui vaadata ka gruusia s jalisi operatsioone siis on need pole rajatud mitte massiivsetele r nnakutele lootus on rajatud rahumeelsetele lahendustele seda pole paraku veel juhtunud
2067386 eriti murelikuks teevad mind teated et konflikti on sekkunud ka venemaa s jalennukid ja pommitama on hakatud ka gruusia territooriumi mis asub v ljaspool l una osseetia konfliktipiirkonda
2067387 see on v ga kahetsusv rne sest vene rahuvalvajad on p dnud viimastel p evadel s jategevusse mitte sattuda gruusia pool on teinud k ik endast s ltuva et venemaa rahuvalvajad ei satuks r nnaku alla

2067417 the department is not aware of karl rove playing any role in the decision to appoint mr griffin
2067418 not aware of anyone lobbying either inside or outside of the administration for mr griffins appointment
2067419 it will be as much about the cover up as about the firings
2067420 are going to tell a narrative and they have taken their investigation right into the white house
2067421 i knew that then white house political director sara taylor and taylors then deputy scott jennings had expressed interest in promoting mr griffin for appointment to be u s attorney and i assumed because they reported to karl rove that he was interested in that
2067422 in february when i participated in the drafting of that february 23 letter i did not remember then ever having talked directly to mr rove about it i dont remember now ever having talked to mr rove about it im not sure whether mr rove was supportive of mr griffins appointment
2067423 kyle didnt want to traffic in assumptions so he circulated the letter to the white house for confirmation whether what he believed to be true was accurate or not he drafted the letter according to his understanding of the facts and he circulated it beforehand to other people for clearance to assure that it accorded with their understanding of the facts
2067424 chris did not recall karls interest when he reviewed the letter
2067425 we have no record of that letter even leaving the white house counsels office
2067426 im concerned we imply that well pull down griffins nomination should pryor object
2067427 i think we should gum this to death ask the senators to give tim a chance meet with him give him some time in office to see how he performs etc they ultimately say no never and the longer they forestall the better then we can tell them well look for other candidates and otherwise run out the clock all of this should be done in good faith of course
2067428 the only thing really at work here is a repeal of the ags appointment authority there is some risk that well lose that authority but if we dont ever exercise it then whats the point of having it
2067429 im not 100 percent sure that tim was the guy on which to test drive this authority but know that getting him appointed was important to harriet karl etc
2067430 the principals never adopted it and it was never done

2067434 the circuit seems very very well prepared theres obviously some work to do before f1 arrives but its not like a normal street track
2067435 its something more it seems wide it seems like an american type of street circuit i think it will be a nice and interesting grand prix not only the race but also the atmosphere will be quite different for sure im looking forward to the grand prix
2067436 we dont have any simulator with that kind of possibility
2067437 we respect the decision of the court and we will move forward on the prosecution of the 20 other cases in the system
2067438 hamdan is now considered a convicted war criminal and is no longer considered an enemy combatant and will be held separately from the other detainees at guantanamo because of his new status
2067439 the decision by the jury will now go through a number of reviews as provided by the rules and regulations of the commission
2067440 any verdict resulting from such a flawed system is a betrayal of american values the rules for the guantanamo military commissions are so flawed that justice could never be served from start to finish this has been a monumental debacle of american justice
2067441 the judgment against hamdan undoubtedly will be challenged in legitimate courts but there is no appeal from the judgment of future generations this system was devised to permit the prosecution of alleged wrongdoing by detainees while continuing to cover up the wrongdoing by government interrogators trials that are shrouded in secrecy and tainted by coercion are the very antithesis of american justice
2067442 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states or our interests we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
2067443 i welcome todays guilty verdict in the first trial held under the military commissions act this process of bringing terrorists to justice has been too long delayed but im encouraged that it is finally moving forward
2067444 the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully
2067445 that the hamdan trial the first military commission trial with a guilty verdict since 9 11 took several years of legal challenges to secure a conviction for material support for terrorism underscores the dangerous flaws in the administrations legal framework its time to better protect the american people and our values by bringing swift and sure justice to terrorists through our courts and our uniform code of military justice and while it is important to convict anyone who provides material support for terrorism it is long past time to capture or kill osama bin laden and the terrorists who murdered nearly 3 000 americans
2067446 the pentagon must be very proud of itself today it was able to obtain a conviction of arguably the least culpable among the 80 detainees it intends to prosecute as war criminals it convicted a truck driver of being guilty of driving a truck
2067447 hamdans trial violated two of the most fundamental criminal justice principles accepted by all civilized nations the prohibition on the use of coerced evidence and the prohibition on retroactive criminal laws
2067448 the decision to keep these cases out of the ordinary criminal courts will produce years of appeals over novel legal issues raised by the untested military commissions system even after those appeals are finished the process will never be seen as legitimate by the world

2067528 this seems like a big deal to us here and now
2067529 but there are more than a billion chinese who dont care a lick who won this game
2067530 without question coach k will soon be occupying one of the largest coaching platforms in the history of sports
2067531 literally a billion people all over the world will connect to mike and his family
2067532 for much of the world coach k is the living embodiment of duke and thats a good thing
2067533 a billion people will see and hear the name duke and they will forever associate it with excellence many of them might even learn to spell krzyzewski which i know would make coach k very happy
2067534 i was asked to participate in a live web chat with chinese students
2067535 as you may know internet usage in china is pervasive and among students enthusiasm for it is matched only by enthusiasm for americas great universities which certainly includes duke i sat down expecting to get questions about specific departments and how a chinese student can feel at home at duke and in durham all of which i received but in between were very well informed questions about coach k they wanted to know what he was like whether he would ever recruit in china and how the season was going to go basketball has become a universal language and that has certainly helped duke
2067536 were always interested in attracting the best students the best faculty the best research clearly its a very competitive marketplace
2067537 the olympics is one of the great global spectacles and this one perhaps more than ever before because of chinas emergence on the world stage
2067538 so the value to duke of having not just coach k but alumni and current students participating is immense and will continue to enhance dukes reputation and visibility around the world
2067539 remember that dukes olympic team ranges from coach k and some of our most prominent alumni like carlos boozer and rebecca smith to rebecca ward an incoming freshman who also happens to be one of the best fencers in the world everyone in the duke family can identify with these remarkable women and men and know that they share a common connection
2067540 the championship game will be their first weekend at duke
2067541 i talked to a duke undergrad from hong kong who came over and became a total dukie and a huge duke basketball fan
2067542 hes now pursuing an mba at stanford during spring break he made a trip to moscow to study the russian economy while there he broke away from the group to visit a little flea market on the outskirts of town there he found a russian nestling doll a hand painted wooden doll with smaller and smaller dolls inside of the duke basketball team this years duke team there were dolls for gerald henderson kyle singler and the smallest doll inside was greg paulus
2067543 in terms of all duke alums the international contingent is rather small
2067544 but as duke becomes global or i should say is becoming more global we have more and more presence we have alumni clubs in hong kong tokyo and seoul
2067545 having coach k and the team go over there offered a great opportunity to invite some top alums donors and friends
2067546 we sent out the invitations not knowing what kind of response wed get well the response was overwhelming some 50 or 60 duke alums flew in from tokyo seoul tai pei singapore bangkok and hong kong well most of the hong kong contingent came by hydrofoil
2067547 even as recently as 15 years ago applications from mainland china were rare
2067548 now they are very common it used to be hong kong taiwan japan korea as the culture and politics have changed its not as unusual as it used to be or not as common as its going to be china is just so big and so interested in becoming a part of the global community so at this point the exposure coach k and duke will get will fall on fertile ground
2067549 if we had that exposure and didnt have the academic ranking that we do it wouldnt have much impact
2067550 but when you combine coach k and duke basketball with oh say the evaluation of the london financial times which rates dukes corporate education program no 1 or the overall university top 10 ranking by u s news and world report and you have an effective synergy
2067551 duke has some very ambitious plans for international programs and expansion that we will be announcing in the coming year
2067552 these new programs will of course stand on their own merits as exemplary academic initiatives but the visibility from the olympics will give us a boost at just the right time
2067553 it will raise the level of awareness about duke around the world
2067554 i dont know how to quantify that its huge perhaps priceless
2067555 what does it mean well it means a lot especially if you win
2067556 that will bring something to duke thats the thing about whether you are a history professor here or a doctor or whatever when you do something that gets national or international recognition it helps duke well the fact is duke always helps you its a neat thing
2067557 will it be 100 applications or 1 000 i have no way of knowing that
2067558 when it comes to something like winning a national championship or reaching the final four weve learned what to expect it will be fun to see what effect this will be it will be easy to measure well see if there is a spike in applications from asian students well see what they say in their essays
2067559 when you have a larger pool of students that means you have a larger pool of qualified students
2067560 i expect foreign students to be making the same kind of decision to attend duke that u s students make our students do not apply to duke because of athletics its because they are smart and also want to be part of the spirit expressed by athletics you can count on the fingers of one hand the number of schools that honestly combine academics and athletics
2067561 not at all coach k is a teacher and a very successful one at that
2067562 he happens to conduct his classes in front of thousands of spectators in person and millions more on tv but his skill at teaching the values he brings to his classroom and his concern for his students reflect dukes very high standards for excellence so i could not be prouder to have him representing duke on the world stage
2067563 sirt1 is an important mediator of cholesterol efflux and as such its predicted to play a role in the development of age associated diseases where cholesterol is a contributing factor

2067569 the reality is that youve got a military establishment and i think they are really running things
2067570 youve got a military establishment which i think believes it has the power to crush resistance it had the power to ensure there wasnt a free and fair election
2067571 it will take more than that to provide guarantees on property rights and other macro economic issues
2067572 i dont think the market believes that the situation is going to work if its just business as usual
2067573 i do believe that keeping mugabe on as titular president is not a deal breaker as far as financial markets and other investors are concerned

2067626 originally trained in classical music before moving on to other academic pursuits daniel has written recorded and produced all of plushguns music so far with help from some guest musicians
2067627 not that theres anything bubblegummy about plushgun this is pop in the best possible way pop meaning music that feels really good
2067628 plushgun is a beautiful mix of indie rock sound with high voltage electronic backbeats created entirely by the 23 year old new york based trained classical composer who lives sleeps and records everything in a tiny 8 by 5 closet bedroom that has no windows or ventilation the isolation and cramped space does not seem to have cramped plushguns musical stylings though with a voice born to croon over these beautiful orchestrated tunes that seems to come from a soul much older than his 23 years plushgun will definitely be on my radar for a long time to come and should be on yours too
2067629 from the moment i heard just impolite ive been wanting to hear more how is one not supposed to fall in love with the music plushgun is an undeniable guilty pleasure
2067630 actually marvelous doesnt really cut it in this case this music is sweeping catchy fun uplifting sad huge quaint and just darned beautiful all of the tracks ive had the chance to listen to are absolutely stunning but just impolite makes my heart soar seriously i listened to it about 4 times in a row
2067631 plushgun presents a great mix of indie rock and electronic undertones which is self described as indie electro licious and it sure is
2067632 plushguns music is very good for dancing your ass off and very catchy i bet you find yourself singing along and jumping about the room in a fit of dance craziness
2067633 well you kind of hate them but their songs are so catchy resistance is futile

2067642 a slight pale young woman from eversley england marling works in the bleak and articulate tradition of english folksingers like richard thompson and anne briggs though i also hear the urgent cadence of fiona apple in several songs
2067643 ms marling has learned more than tunes from the british ballad tradition she has also absorbed its absence of self pity and its determination to chronicle sorrows as clearly as joys calmly outlasting them all
2067644 the 18 year old marling is becoming known for a silvery strong voice a clear eyed comprehension of the world

2067655 a lot of the things ben wrote into the script are things that he himself has experienced even some of his own vanities he put into the script so its kind of self deprecating in a way
2067656 i think the whole movie is like were all doing that for sure thats the point
2067657 the whole vibe of the movie is that were saying look at how ridiculous this world is
2067658 its the nature of being an actor and being in big movies and the infrastructure around it and the way people get protected and the way people sort of build fences around themselves some out of necessity but its a very tough world to navigate i think
2067659 so we wanted to just have fun because actors i think have a great sense of humour about themselves and just say this is just ridiculous
2067660 a lot of times when youve got a director whos also the actor theyll be obsessed and focused on their performance but not so in this case
2067661 he would defer to the other actors and make sure that we got all our rocket sauce in the scene before he would focus on his beauty shots
2067662 i would probably not have loved it if i saw somebody doing me
2067663 indeed the two actually collaborated on a segment of the 1999 mtv movie awards in which stiller played cruises starstruck stuntman
2067664 since then we stayed in touch and talked about stuff over the years and then i showed him the script and he really was intrigued by the idea of this movie and then he i give him credit for this character he really came up with this idea
2067665 it sort of spurred me and co writer justin theroux to go back and work on this guy this character
2067666 cruises willingness to turn a cameo into a full fledged supporting role stiller says
2067667 so it ended up being one of these weird organic things that just developed
2067668 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
2067669 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2067670 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2067671 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2067672 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
2067673 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
2067674 there needs to be a negative mccain track beyond the bush policy stuff one of the great strengths of the obama campaign has been to not listen to the d c chattering class they have a plan and they stick to it but clearly the d c chattering class are all wringing their hands
2067675 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2067676 there are no independent groups everybodys walked off the field
2067677 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2067678 my favorite song is about robbing blind people hint hint
2067679 yeah thanks and all but where the fucks my hair straightener look at my hair im told it looks awful
2067680 you and jill have clearly been trained in psychoanalyzing confused minds
2067681 great insights into the mysteriously criminal mind of sunshinedaydream you and jill have clearly been trained in psychoanalyzing
2067682 yes because blind people have little bells on all their stuff so they know its the right thing theyre picking up its hard work removing all the little bells from the stuff in order to sell it on
2067683 my mom for now is gonna have to drive us to school im about to get my license an then ill be driving my sister you know almost an hour everyday and its dangerous on the roads
2067684 these are the children they want in the school that are the overachievers that are in the i b c i s programs and its just making it harder for them to be in those programs and to be apart of murphy
2067685 were tapped out in terms of our transportation budget and im obviously quite frightened about any increase in fuel costs that might occur during this next school year
2067686 my sisters a freshman cheerleader this year so on the days that shes not here with band shes here for cheerleading and so my moms here we live an hour away and as the gas prices are rising it just gets worse and worse
2067687 im extremely proud of how our players performed in the classroom over the summer
2067688 the fact that every scholarship player in our program was enrolled and we earned better than a 3 0 gpa as a team is a very significant achievement
2067689 for now the news site will keep you informed educated and hopefully excited about our release in october but eventually our website will evolve into something much bigger and better to support our community of players creators and sharers
2067690 said if you dont follow our rules you wont get on a committee
2067691 these trials are not just about a few men and what they may have done they are about the message the united states is sending to the world and that message right now is flat wrong convictions by any means necessary
2067692 the us needs to show it stands for openness and fairness the very values we are fighting for instead we get verdicts rammed down the gullet of justice
2067693 we were told that guantanamo was necessary because these were the worlds most dangerous terrorists
2067694 salim hamdan is not one of the worlds most dangerous terrorists
2067695 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states or our interests we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
2067696 fundamentally flawed and that the tribunals should be abandoned in all cases
2067697 without people like mr hamdan bin laden would enjoy no support enjoy no protection and would probably have been unable to elude capture up until this point
2067698 i just read sherris articles about decorating for halloween but does she or anyone have ideas for a combination 16th birthday halloween party i never have parties and i dont want bored teenagers on my hands any ideas would be greatly appreciated
2067699 it changes the whole way you look at the recent moves in this market
2067700 there may have been multiple positions which were reclassified but they all appear to have been held by just one trader and this was a very special trader with an enormous concentration of positions in crude oil amounting to perhaps 460 million barrels and not much interest in anything else
2067701 this reclassification issue highlights the fact that improvements are still needed in the area of data collection and that the agency does not yet have the comprehensive data we need to make any declarative statements about the overall role of speculators in commodity markets
2067702 if freddie mercury sang for death from above 1979 these guys would open the show
2067703 our legal counsel is currently reviewing the possible next steps in the litigation and while we are disappointed by the courts decision it has no impact on our day to day operation of the business
2067704 we have not factored any income from canon into our business plans we continue to make excellent progress in the other areas of our business including conductive inks sensors and nanomaterials as well as in other activities in the electron emission and display fields such as backlights our revenue and backlog levels remain strong
2067705 i was just sitting out in my cab thinking she was going out there cashing a check but she wasnt cashing no check
2067706 as far as the advertisement in the print media is concerned which carries dish tvs advertisement aaj ki taja khaber that offers free set top boxes on a close scrutiny of these advertisements we notice that all such advertisements carry the payment scheme of rs 3990 in a box
2067707 it was obvious that prospective consumer who reads the details of the advertisement will be aware of the payment plan of rs 3990 printed in the box alongside the advertisement and will reasonably conclude that the set top box is offered free of cost with this scheme therefore we do not find any misrepresentative being made to the prospective consumers in regard to the scheme
2067708 not carry any advertisement for its set top box free offer without indicating the scheme of rs 3990
2067709 they are trying to have it both ways amp its not going to work
2067710 that she has secretly signaled to rank and file house democratic lawmakers that they should feel free to portray themselves publicly as pro drilling if it helps them politically key excerpts and audio from boehners interview follow
2067711 they may go out there and say they are for drilling or they are for more energy or they are for our all of the above energy plan the american energy plan but they are the same democrats who voted to adjourn last friday they are the same ones who voted against our motion to try and bring this bill up time and time again and so they are trying to have it both ways and its not going to work show us what your plan is theyve brought all of these bills to the floor which are excuses to not have an all of the above plan an all of the above plan says we need more incentives for conservation we need more biofuels we need to develop alternative sources of energy quicker we need more nuclear energy and we need it now and yes we need more american made oil and gas which we can produce in an environmentally safe way
2067712 all were asking for as house republicans is a vote were not asking them to pass it we cant presume that all were asking of nancy pelosi is lets let the house work its will let the members represent their constituents and lets vote now im pretty confident that our bill will pass which is exactly why she wont put it on the floor and this idea that she is going to allow democrats to out there and tell youre folks youre for drilling blame it on me be on the right side of this and you can have it both ways is not going to work at all

2067714 or in the instance of wii fit digital bathroom scales
2067715 what nintendo have done with the wii is truly fantastic there is no question about it but i think sometimes there is a thin line between gimmick and great gameplay
2067716 weve seen some research that says 60 per cent of people who bought a wii fit play it once and dont play it again
2067717 and at the end of the day that comes back down to creativity we have to ensure that the peripheral strategy that anyone employs makes sense and delivers a truly game changing experience because if its just okay it will end up in the cupboard under the stairs
2067718 new user interfaces are there and will continue to come and that are good but only if they enhance the gameplay experience they are not good if they are gimmicks there is a challenge for us to make sure that all new user interfaces are deep and are rewarding to the end user
2067719 if you look a what people dont like about existing karaoke games its that youve got wired microphones which look like theyve come out of a toy shop and a fairly restricted song base

2067760 er was veel te zien ik hoop dat onze sporters hier zeer goed presteren
2067761 laat ik het er op houden dat ik hoop dat we zo veel mogelijk medailles winnen het gaf me een warm gevoel de nederlandse ploeg het stadion te zien binnenlopen
2067762 het is goed je af en toe op grote doelen te focussen in dat opzicht mogen we best groot denken
2067763 sport is ongelooflijk belangrijk ik ben ook hier om dat uit te stralen er zijn zeer veel gewichtige zaken voor de samenleving aan verbonden gezondheid cultuur respect het is zeer de moeite waard ons daar voor in te spannen
2067764 we hadden voor de start van de voorbereiding ook al spelers kunnen wegsturen maar we wilden iedereen aan het werk zien en beoordelen dat vonden we zuiverder ik denk niet dat ik verder op deze zaak moet ingaan

2067767 thanks to the concern of olympic organizers the chinese government and the cooperation of the korean government we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region that is very industrially active
2067768 capmex is going to be the very first uav campaign in east asia for air pollution and cloud interaction studies
2067769 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
2067770 black carbon in soot is a major contributor to global warming
2067771 by determining the effects of soot reductions during the olympics on atmospheric heating we can gain much needed insights into the magnitude of future global warming
2067772 ramanathans earlier research on atmospheric brown clouds demonstrated their importance in how solar energy is distributed throughout the polluted regions of our atmosphere
2067773 capmex takes his work an important step forward with new innovative micro and nano sensor technologies that will provide additional quantitative estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region
2067774 it is an amazing honor for the mens and womens track amp field teams
2067775 i am extremely proud of them and pleased that we have set this tone in my first year at lipscomb university
2067776 it is an indication of the quality of our student athletes and our desire to excel in all areas this is the true spirit of what being an ncaa division i student athlete is all about as we continue to improve dramatically athletically i expect we will also increase our academic achievements as well it is a very exciting time for the mens and womens cross country and track amp field programs at lipscomb
2067777 i mean i dont see how hes going to get in there learn a new scheme get on the same page as his receivers and be able to go for the opener at miami its a lot to ask of a guy even brett favre
2067778 each west coast system has its own little variations but its easier going from one west coast offense to another theres a lot of overlap because most of the west coast disciples learned it from bill walsh thats why i thought it would have been an easier transition going to the bucs
2067779 he has had no problem changing plays at the line in the past and youre not going to get that old dog to break those habits
2067780 its going to be a tug of war i think you want a guy like brett going on his instinct because its so good but you also want to be sure he knows this offense inside and out
2067781 he has new england and san diego right off the bat in weeks 2 and 3
2067782 whoa boy they are going to test his protection right away they have new guys all over that offensive line and brett had better know his pass protections youre going to see some different stuff from them in those 3 4 defenses zone pressures linemen dropping off defensive backs blitzing i bet theyll throw the kitchen sink at him
2067783 i didnt think they panicked this offseason i just didnt like all the signings they made
2067784 the damien woody deal was out of whack calvin pace cost them a lot too the others i thought were okay
2067785 but from my perspective a team that should be better in a lot of phases of the game making a trade for a quarterback on august 7 wreaks a little of desperation they wanted chad penningtons head with kellen clemenss arm in theory you get some of both with brett but i just dont see him step in and playing like he did a year ago
2067786 bretts a great guy one of the boys and the guys will probably love him in the locker room but is he too much of a rock star now after all this thats what i wonder can he come in and be just one of the guys i dont know
2067787 esto no es ning n conflicto entre rusia y georgia es algo que rechazo categ ricamente
2067788 georgia se encuentra en una situaci n de defensa propia
2067789 no es una acci n militar es una operaci n anti criminal para proteger a nuestros civiles pac ficos tanto georgianos como osetios
2067790 la situaci n es el resultado de una pol tica de apaciguamiento de determinados estados que abastecen a georgia con armas entre ellos tambi n los estados unidos
2067791 estamos muy preocupados sobre los informes que relatan que un gran n mero de tropas y tanques rusos est n pasando el t nel de roki en violaci n de la soberan a e integridad de georgia
2067792 hugest thing thats happened to leadville since we discovered gold
2067793 the whole town is buzzing and we are way beyond excited
2067794 a race like this takes a lot of experience and endurance he has that so i guess hes the odds on favorite
2067795 i would reiterate that ill be happy if im top five i dont think im in it to win it as they say
2067796 i dont think lance does anything on a lark i think hell be prepared
2067797 i dont know how prepared floyd was last year what im saying is if we were equally prepared i just cant see where those guys wouldnt pummel me
2067798 dave wiens is super human hes just as fantastic on mountain bikes as lance armstrong is on road bikes
2067799 i dont know if i can beat wiens but im 100 percent sure i can beat carmichael
2067800 i will be home showered and probably three beers in by the time carmichael gets back
2067801 wie das empire state building man sollte lieber etwas bauen was architektonisch besser rein passt
2067802 es ist gut dass der platz anders genutzt wird ob es reinpasst mal abwarten
2067803 kann mir nicht vorstellen dass der platz ausreicht architektonisch gesehen passt es auch nicht rein
2067804 warum muss man gleich so hoch bauen bald sieht es hier aus wie in paris ich finde es gut so wie es ist
2067805 das sticht ja ganz sch n raus aber ich finds gut es schadet nicht wenn da mal was modernes gebaut wird
2067806 ich w rde es gut finden wenn hier neu gebaut w rde diese br cke ist doch ziemlich h sslich
2067807 paren ya las deportaciones y la represi n contra los trabajadores haitianos
2067808 como alguien que viaja a santo domingo entre cuatro a cinco veces al a o y que sigue viviendo en un barrio popular de la capital como es villa juana la vaina que yo veo es como la gente all maltrata a los haitianos ese discurso anti haitiano que se levanta entre la gente normal como la de mi barrio por ejemplo es una vaina muy fea y tenemos que hacer algo para tratar de cambiar la situaci n
2067809 el que me dice que el dominicano es anti haitiano es un loco yo nac en santo domingo y lo que hay all es un odio contra los haitianos que es impresionante a veces da risa o r a un dominicano m s prieto que tres haitianos diciendo que esos inmigrantes son malos
2067810 es una locura y una enfermedad que tenemos que mejorar
2067811 en todas mis obras siempre toco ese tema porque desde donde vengo de la calle 21 en villa juana se vive cotidianamente ese drama
2067812 eso se ve tenemos que hacer alguna labor para mejorar como ser humano no para seguir ascendiendo como artista

2067815 they are the true meaning of the word student athlete and consistently represent the university in a first class manner im happy they can receive such a high honor
2067816 what if we decided that failure is not an option and that success is the only choice available to us
2067817 have somebody save us a seat on the school bus of life
2067818 it seems that those of continuously alternating letters are prone to quickly change their minds often for no reason for example the immediate withdrawal of troops from iraq as stated by presumptive democratic presidential nominee barak obama has now been qualified to state that the troop withdrawal will be made in an orderly manner this flip flopping is common for those uniletered sic named individuals
2067819 obama gave during a recent speech in detroit to a large group of supporters the first part of his speech told the individuals in attendance to take full responsibility of their actions while the second half discussed the many new government programs needed to help the poor this further demonstrated the duplicitous nature of the uniletered group
2067820 obama is probably the best example of this schizophrenic pattern
2067821 its obvious that by eliminating related letters the as and thebs amp m the remaining rko and its foundation in the movies shows that mr obama might be great at reading a script but really doesnt understand what hes saying
2067822 another telling feature to sen obamas name are his initials
2067823 weve had presidents with initials that have become synonymous with greatness fdr hst dde jfk lbj to cite but a few but to have a president with the initials b o would raise quite a stink in the international community

2067843 in een adviesorganisatie als vka is echter niet zozeer die relatie belangrijk als wel de relatie met de mensen binnen die organisatie namelijk de individuele consultants wij zijn echt op persoonsniveau gericht de manier waarop interaction is opgezet sluit helemaal aan bij onze manier van werken
2067844 the decade long debt binge will most likely end in inflation
2067845 similarly there is a misunderstanding of the increase in credit increasing the money supply this only happens if the monetary authority supplies this credit out of fiat
2067846 sorry you will have to wait for return of your goods as i leased them out to someone else without your knowledge
2067847 sorry i pledged your goods as security for my loans and my creditors re possessed the goods
2067848 what about the option of the government setting up special funds which would take over banks distressed loan and security portfolios here banks would receive interest bearing claims against the government sponsored special funds while the latter would be refinanced by issuing government guaranteed bonds however such a transaction would reduce the economys money stock the governments special fund would pay for banks assets with commercial bank money which was acquired through the issue of bonds as a result the banking sectors balance sheet volume would shrink and so would the money stock
2067849 the resolution is that green paper dollars are not fiat money they are backed by the assets of the fed just as gm stock is backed by gms assets
2067850 fractional reserve banking is not a government invention or a government intervention it is merely a banking practice for liquidity and balance sheet management
2067851 the whole reason our dollar is called a fiat money is simply because the federal reserve has no assets backing up the dollar
2067852 competition between metal and paper under free banking resulted in increasing use of paper and reduced use of metal
2067853 thus consumers appear to be wanting high quality paper as their holdings for conducting their transactions
2067854 the feds balance sheet identifies its gold holdings and its bond holdings as
2067855 economists who call the dollar fiat money observe that the dollar is physically inconvertible into gold and conclude that it is unbacked the most remarkable thing about this simple non sequitur is that it has survived virtually unquestioned for centuries
2067856 the resolution is that green paper dollars are not fiat money they are backed by the assets of the fed
2067857 what fed assets are you talking about treasury bonds or are you talking about the asset

2067872 it seems that weve got a lot of selling based on the stronger dollar
2067873 energy demand destruction and the dollar return have formed a quiet alliance to bring the oil market down and today the louder of the two is the dollar

2067875 in response to the appeal of the legislative council chairman dr ahmad bahr the ministry decided to release abdullah abu samhadana as a gesture of goodwill and to reduce the palestinian division and clashes
2067876 to beat laredo thunder bay has to limit the time and space of juan ibarra
2067877 garcia makes great runs in behind the defense and if ibarra has the time he will pick him out
2067878 they played a very motivated game but when we went down to ten men we were not able to limit the chances of ibarra who is a crafty little midfielder that sits in behind felix garcia and knows the type of ball that felix dives on ibarra put garcia in twice against us and he is a guy that doesnt need more than one chance to score
2067879 obviously felix is a big part of what they do
2067880 their type of play is geared towards getting him the ball their goalkeeper is also very good
2067881 you have to be very organized in the back and know where brandon swartzendruber gustavo oliveira and jeremy gold are at all times
2067882 you cannot give those guys any room you also need to match them emotionally they are a team that plays with a lot of heart and emotion they try to send messages with crushing tackles but they border on that line of being aggressive and being sent off
2067883 their defensive midfielder anthony putrus is their heart and soul
2067884 it is important for a team to have an identity and he is exactly that but he plays with so much emotion that if you frustrate him he gets into a mindset where he could easily be carded
2067885 i am a friend of india and a supporter of us india nuclear cooperation
2067886 yet i find it incomprehensible that the administration apparently intends to seek or accept an exemption from the nsg guidelines for india with few or none of the conditions contained in the henry j hyde united states india peaceful atomic energy cooperation act of 2006
2067887 such an exemption would be inconsistent with us law place american firms at a severe competitive disadvantage and undermine critical us nonproliferation objectives
2067888 it would also jeopardise congressional support for nuclear cooperation with india this year and in the future
2067889 we are very concerned and my phone has been ringing off the hook after we learned of it
2067890 on the other hand there is a positive part to it it really woke us up very quickly so that we can get our act together and try to move forward knowing what kind of opposition and resistance we are going to face
2067891 we knew where he berman was coming from we had our doubts about him but we didnt know that it would come so early and so clearly and so categorically
2067892 we all know where berman was coming from but his firing this first shot has now put us on the defensive and we believe that kakodkars statement contributed to it and sparked it off
2067893 he should not have made this comment publicly at all that was not correct it was a huge mistake it puts the administration also on a bit of the defensive
2067894 we believe this is an important programme we believe that we can get it through this year and were going to work toward that end
2067895 obviously anything that we proceed with will be consistent with the us law
2067896 were working with congress to discuss the issues and resolve any outstanding concerns that they may have were working through the nsg to obtain their approval by early september and we hope at that time to present the package to our congress
2067897 we hope that after discussions that they will be able to pass that and well be able to proceed with this very important programme
2067898 we have already spoken with some of bermans top aides and we will also be sending him letters and e mails
2067899 were telling him that we understand and appreciate his concerns and we hope that the state department will address his concerns but that if the agreement is put off to the next congress it will definitely kill the deal
2067900 and that the prime minister put his political credibility on line to become and ally of the united states and the left and mayawati are waiting even for a pin hole to oust this government and so if this is sent to next year then this deal is absolutely going to be out of the question
2067901 we will make all this clear to him again when we meet with him
2067902 house speaker nancy pelosi is with us although berman is thinking this way and although he is the chairman he is one person in the committee and the other members of the committee are on board and most importantly we believe the speaker is on board with us
2067903 he may be the chairman but he is no senator joe biden chairman of the senate foreign relations committee he doesnt have the kind of clout and influence that for example biden has he doesnt have that kind of power he doesnt have that kind of gravitas
2067904 we cannot start a war with him we have to work with him and the last thing we need are any delaying tactics because we are hoping that if the agreement clears the nsg in late august or early september and comes to congress when it reconvenes on september 8 it can be quickly taken up and voted on so that we can have a done deal for the president to sign this year
2067905 before the foreign affairs committee on february 13 of this year you assure me that any nsg decision will have to be completely consistent with the obligations of the hyde act
2067906 i expect you to instruct the us representative to the nsg not to seek or support any exemption for india that does not faithfully reflect all of the hyde act conditions
2067907 however even if the members of the nsg were able to achieve consensus on the many complex issues related to the india exemption during those sessions and the administration were able to submit the india agreement to congress immediately after we convene on september 8 it is not likely that congress will have sufficient time to full consider all the issues and details surrounding the agreement the associated safeguards agreement and the nsg decision and to ascertain their impact on us and global non proliferation standards prior to the target adjournment date of september 26
2067908 any effort to consider the agreement outside of the requirements of current law will be impossible if the administration accepts the nsg exemption that fails to include the hyde act conditions
2067909 deeply concerned about the potential for a significant time gap between an accelerated nsg decision and congressional action on the india agreement
2067910 this would give other countries an unacceptable headstart in securing commercial nuclear contracts with the indian government thus placing us firms at a competitive disadvantage
2067911 if the administration is unwilling to change its position and make clear to the other members of the nsg that it will only accept an exemption that fully conforms to the hyde act then i would urge you in the strongest possible terms to suspend all us efforts to seek an nsg decision on india for the remainder of this administration

2067955 el libro de pagola es un xito de ventas porque es una versi n moderna y cercana y porque la gente busca interpretaciones m ltiples para todo se niega a aceptar una sola lectura una sola interpretaci n

2067960 meras excusas para tratar los problemas que me preocupan como el nazismo o el fanatismo
2067961 no me interesa tanto la religi n en s como su influencia sin la religi n no se puede explicar parte de nuestra historia ni se puede entender por poner un ejemplo muy cercano la manifestaci n de los obispos del a o pasado contra el gobierno de rodr guez zapatero no hay un periodo de la historia en que la religi n no haya jugado un papel preponderante

2067964 a cualquier ser humano creyente o no los temas de la trascendencia y del sufrimiento le afectan
2067965 por ello las manifestaciones art sticas y en concreto la literatura que abordan esos aspectos siempre interesan por su conexi n con esas zonas m s ntimas y profundas de las personas con los interrogantes e incertidumbres que todos llevamos dentro

2067972 theres not much left once you take out germanys staggering export growth each time theres a global shock european policy makers say that they are relatively immune and each time that turns out not be the case
2067973 the data has been dreadful but the ecb has surprised us before they are monetarists after all
2067974 it makes it much harder for the ecb to steer monetary policy in the single currency it should be stopped altogether
2067975 its so exciting to actually be able to come and see the team playing getting out on the court and seeing them get some ball contact

2067993 when he was appointed in 2003 to head the efcc ribadu was only a chief superintendent of police and served briefly as assistant and deputy commissioner of police his appointment marked the beginning of a committed battle against corruption that has eaten too deep into the fabric of the nation under the obasanjo regime ribadus efcc was most feared among those described as enemies of the obasanjo administration not done with the feat achieve in the plateau ribadu moved to bayelsa state where former governor diepreye alamieyeseigha was finally routed out of office and arraigned before the courts on accounts of corrupt enrichment the allegation then was that then president obasanjo was using the efcc to deal with his enemies others alleged that plots were being hatched to pursue an aggressive campaign of selective prosecution retired major general muhammadu buhari though an opposition leader rose in defence of ribadu insisting that the man was doing an excellent job the former head of state praised the courage of the efcc boss and expressed hope that if the commission was allowed to do its job the way it should

2068133 the game will be set in the 1960s and will take place in miami havana and new york
2068134 this is the first study to demonstrate that long term calorie restriction with optimal nutrition has cardiac specific effects that ameliorate age associated declines in heart function
2068135 this decline in diastolic function is a marker of primary aging
2068136 diastolic function declines in most people as they get older but in this study we found that diastolic function in calorie restricted people resembled diastolic function in individuals about 15 years younger
2068137 our hypothesis is that low grade chronic inflammation is mediating primary aging
2068138 its not the only factor of course aging is a complex process but we found less inflammation in these people less tnfa c reactive protein and tgfb as well as a more flexible ventricle in their hearts
2068139 its very clear from these studies that caloric restriction has a powerful protective effect against diseases associated with aging
2068140 we dont know how long each individual will end up living but they certainly have a longer life expectancy than average because theyre most likely not going to die from a heart attack stroke or diabetes and if in fact their hearts are aging more slowly its conceivable theyll live for a very long time
2068141 caloric restriction does not mean eating half a hamburger and half a pack of french fries and drinking half of a sugary beverage
2068142 these people have very good nutrition they eliminate calories by eating nutrient dense foods
2068143 if you change the quality of your diet by increasing the servings of nutrient dense food and reducing actually it would be better to slowly eliminate all of the servings of empty calorie foods you improve your chances of living a healthier and longer life

2068151 right now were going to kind of just go with a blank sheet and let this group develop it
2068152 the health of missouri baptist churches remains my highest concern
2068153 i am convinced that many of our problems will be resolved when our churches are healthy
2068154 we took the same approach to this record as weve done to our previous records which is actually a lack of approach
2068155 theres no approach its just show up and lets play theres no plan we dont map it out we dont decide on a direction we just kind of let it happen real naturally thats how it happened
2068156 but what we do have is writing constantly while were touring any idea we have well try it we dont want to limit ourselves
2068157 weve always wrote about the number of songs that would end up on our records youre not going to hear long lost rise against b sides we rarely have anything extra but this time we wrote some 30 pretty solid ideas things were just flowing out of us we just kept spitting songs out we had to boil that down to a record that was the hard part
2068158 the chorus its definitely taking and looking at where we get our information from and whos telling us the information and whos right and whos wrong and how everything we do has some kind of spin on it and who can you trust
2068159 how we were brought up how we were raised everything and how we separate the truth from the lies and our entire upbringing and when it really boils down its hard to see what we know is true and what we know is false its interesting thought
2068160 thats something we deal with when we play shows that have a recruitment tent
2068161 theres a guy from the army roping in kids were talking about those kids who see the army as an option when i was 17 years old i met with an army recruiter because i considered joining the army the armed forces i wanted to go out and see places and do this we get a lot of e mails from kids who are soldiers all branches from the armed services they come out to our shows they tell you their stories and their stories are in the first verse a sum of a lot of the stories that ive heard
2068162 neil young documented the kent state shootings in ohio and so many bands like creedence clearwater revival and buffalo springfield did so much
2068163 i learned more about the vietnam war from bands like that than i did from the history books as this war is hopefully coming to a close and as stories of what happened are coming out i needed to write a song that dealt with the reality of war
2068164 its a good way to start off this new record because i think the album has a lot of progression and something different to offer
2068165 its still about reaching people putting what were giving into these people making them think and challenge the ways of thought creating conversation and dialogue and putting new ideas forth for people to consider
2068166 and when you have a bigger fanbase thats even more fun to do because all of a sudden your voice is louder now you have a bigger bullhorn than you actually have its exciting and fun and i look forward to the next couple years with this record now that we have a fanbase its just a question of what are we going to do when weve been given the privilege that weve been given
2068167 sometimes we have lock downs because there might be a bank robbery nearby a school so we lock the kids in because we dont want them out while theres still a bank robber still roaming around well this way we can immediately call the parents let them know the school is in lockdown and why and that their kids are safe and then well let them know in another message when the lock down will be lifted and when they can get their kids so its going to serve so many different purposes

2068184 the cards had a handful of players who seemed to impress second string receivers breaston and jerheme urban both performed well in their quest to earn the third wideout role
2068185 urban had four catches for 32 yards and breaston three catches for 50 neither dropped a pass
2068186 barring an unforeseen setback tight end jeremy shockey will be a starter for the saints but with shockey still limited after breaking his leg last season with the new york giants mark campbell has stepped into an active role at the position
2068187 after missing all of last season with a back injury campbell was all over the field thursday he finished with four catches tied for most on the team and 42 yards the longest a 15 yard reception

2068220 out of step with the people of ireland and eu wide political consensus
2068221 throughout the lisbon campaign we argued that every eu member state must retain its own commissioner clearly the social and economic dynamics and needs of each country within the eu are different
2068222 each commissioner brings his unique understanding of his own country to the eu table eu political leaders have already conceded the possibility of retaining a commissioner for each state and the irish people have rejected the proposition of reducing the number of commissioners
2068223 president sarkozys comments are out of step with eu political consensus and indeed the people of ireland
2068224 the fact remains that the eu commission can retain its current make up of a commissioner per member state

2068261 freshman cb randez james came in earlier so i kind of took him under my wing first because he was the only one here but now i have expanded they are all playing pretty well so i cannot really have favorites
2068262 we make sure they stay focused in the meetings and make sure they are studying their playbooks and just come ready to practice every day
2068263 also just try to lead by example if there is a drill we want to be first in line and be doing the drill right
2068264 they are also making plays and i feel they are going to get playing time they are in a position to compete with some of the upperclassmen and ready to contribute to the team
2068265 i like to say in pajamas out there they all look good moving around but when we put the pads on and all the bullets start flying at full speed some guys step it up a little bit and some guys have to kind of get their feet wet before they get in their groove
2068266 jabari is playing corner and is doing a good job for us
2068267 he has some good speed and i am excited about what he is doing and how he is improving in his techniques
2068268 glenn and darko are playing safety glenn also plays our nickel back he is the kind of guy that can play corner nickel and safety he is probably our most versatile player in the secondary darko is doing a good job at our safety position and brings a lot of experience for us there i am very excited about all three young men
2068269 i feel he is really quick and he has played in a lot of football here he had a good spring and he has improved with his footwork after i met with him about certain techniques he was doing that was screwing him up a bit in his coverage he has worked hard over the summer and has looked good the first couple of days on those areas because he has really honed in working on it
2068270 these young men are very bright and we are going to use that to our advantage
2068271 in the secondary they need to understand where everybody is they need to understand the whole concept of the secondary the corner does not just need to know what the corner is doing he needs to understand what the safety is doing and what the inside linebacker is doing therefore he knows where his help is for runs and where his help is for passes
2068272 that is another thing that both coaches really stress we are overseeing the whole defense at safety it is a responsibility to alert motions and make sure everybody recognizes the formation
2068273 i actually lost like ten to twelve pounds since spring practice
2068274 i was about 213 during the spring and now i am down to like 203 also i went down in my body fat i feel leaner stronger and faster it is a lot easier not carrying around the extra weight
2068275 when your budgets tight youre just going to have to make some adjustments

2068277 in januari besloten wij om de site te laten bouwen we hebben drie bedrijven uitgenodigd voor een pitch
2068278 tijdens die wedstrijd hebben we met name op twee dingen gelet ten eerste de pragmatiek en flexibiliteit ten tweede de prijs we staan zelf bekend als prijsvechter dus moet het bedrijf dat onze site gaat bouwen daar zelf ook in mee kunnen gaan
2068279 vanaf dag n zijn we erg tevreden over de samenwerking met netivity het bedrijf is erg flexibel we hebben veelvuldig contact en de lijntjes zijn erg kort ze kunnen snel schakelen en dat heeft izio nl voor in het begin nodig
2068280 die cijfers vertalen wij weer naar verbeterpunten dat kunnen bijvoorbeeld tekstuele zaken zijn of de functionaliteit van de website
2068281 omdat wij nog nieuw zijn is dit noodzakelijk het is vooral een leer proces het is dan goed als je een partner hebt die jou snel begrijpt en nu nog direct de gegevens en mogelijkheden kan aanpassen

2068312 mr perret was stopped on the side of the roadway his vehicle was in drive and his foot was on the gas and on the brake
2068313 his wife actually calls and advises that he had been attacked by a couple of subjects in his backyard
2068314 the more and more that we started digging deeper into the investigation we come to realize that what mike crocker had told us about cutting his tongue out was false
2068315 what would you like to say to the perret family
2068316 they are trying to do whatever they can either by threat of coercion or locking somebody up in jail without a bond in order to try to solve the case they cant do it

2068323 i was not interested in making a record about the d word i got all that stuff out of my system on the last record 2005s pensive songs for silverman which was deliberately stoic this new album is really about me being free which is why it feels cathartic and expressive its about me coming back to being myself
2068324 i came out of the courthouse kissed the ground and walked straight into the studio i felt like a bottle of champagne that had been shaken for 18 months and popped open in the studio thats why this record has so much energy

2068327 there is evidence that having a parent affected with alzheimers disease increases the risk of developing alzheimers disease four to tenfold however we dont know why or how this happens our study shows for the first time that individuals with an alzheimers disease affected mother may be at increased risk for developing alzheimers disease themselves because their brains are not utilizing glucose in an effective way
2068328 we are currently waging a war on terror and now more than ever this border must be guarded

2068332 we dont know who the terrorists are we cant put a face on it it could be your neighbor

2068345 all these additional miles of carpool lanes are going to add to the incentive for folks to carpool anywhere from chandler on the 101 on up to state route 51 in north phoenix
2068346 first of all added traffic capacity along the loop 101 plus its that added incentive where more drivers will be able to carpool and have these miles to do that and theyll be able to use the express buses that will be using the carpool lanes as well
2068347 we seem to get a lot of understanding from folks who know we have to get this work done

2068366 the team will share what theyve learned with representatives in the japanese feed barley industry and based on this information the industry will increase procurement of u s barley under japans simultaneous buy and sell barley system
2068367 the team was very impressed with the vastness of the field and the quality of the barley
2068368 they saw grain storage facilities and three different barley varieties the group also had a lot of questions especially about how contracting is done in the united states
2068369 their visit provided a chance for them as buyers to learn about us their suppliers
2068370 i also think they gained a better understanding of the complexity of production agriculture
2068371 the reaction tony and i have received for war heroes from fans and retailers alike has been phenomenal so we arranged this tour to say thank you to as many of them as possible

2068378 we do not support the development of a third runway at heathrow and in principle all other new runways in the uk unless there is a clear sustainability case
2068379 aviation volume should only be allowed to grow in line with improvements in technology that allow total emissions to remain stable
2068380 the research found a third runway at heathrow and other new runway proposals conflict with the uks target to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 by 2050
2068381 if we do not manage aviation growth within its current emission levels we will have no chance of meeting the uks greenhouse gas targets a line in the sand has to be drawn
2068382 technological progress would allow for moderate growth however the industry needs to ramp up its efforts for this to be realised
2068383 if the industry can demonstrate it is able to expand without increasing emissions growth would be best accommodated at existing uk regional airports
2068384 the most important priority for heathrow is making it better not bigger
2068385 the case is based on a massive increase in the number of transfer passengers but the economic value of transfer passengers is hotly disputed
2068386 we basically looked at dft figures the projections for improvements in technology and contrasted these with projections for uk greenhouse gas emissions
2068387 even if we assume aviation does not grow from 2030 air travel would still account for about 50 of total emissions in 2050
2068388 willie walsh and ryanairs michael oleary can say what they want they ignore where we are heading
2068389 if we continue to expand air travel there is no way we can reduce emissions as we need to the rest of the economy would have to contract to 10 of its current size and i cannot see that is realistic or equitable
2068390 a step change in technology looks unlikely there is potential for slow incremental improvements in traffic management and lighter aircraft and we welcome research into alternative fuels but this problem is immediate
2068391 we do not want to stop people taking their annual holiday and we are not saying aviation cannot grow but it should only be allowed to grow within the range of efficiency improvements
2068392 we had other programming commitments and respect for other audiences so we cant keep all the people happy all the time
2068393 the ratings results from thursday for make me a supermodel and the soccer show the decision was vindicated
2068394 it is dangerous and highly toxic because the message to teenage girls is that their own prospects of success are based on body image and how to market themselves sexually
2068395 a vast number of football fans were not able to see it live
2068396 showing the game live was something we certainly discussed with the australian olympic committee and channel 7

2068404 shar lih ik geloof aan den heiland winnetou is een christen vaarwel
2068405 er ging een krampachtig beven door zijn lichaam een groote bloedgolf stroomde uit zijn mond het opperhoofd der apachen drukte nogmaals mijn handen toen rekte hij zijn ledematen zijn vingers lieten de mijne los hij was dood wat zal ik nog verder vertellen de diepste smart heeft geen woorden
2068406 ik behoor tot de talrijke nederlanders die karl may niet alleen in hun jeugd gelezen hebben maar nog immer lezen alleen ik kom er rond voor uit weinig volwassenen doen dit zij gaan naar een boekhandel en kopen een old shatterhand voor hun jongste zoon de bediende pakt het boek met een fijne glimlach in hij weet dat het kereltje het werk pas in handen krijgt als vader het eerst heeft stukgelezen
2068407 het is natuurlijk een hele eer om dat te mogen doen
2068408 ik had er persoonlijk nooit aan gedacht dat ik dat zou mogen doen dus toen philippe rogge me belde met de vraag of ik het wilde doen was ik heel aangenaam verrast ik had het niet verwacht want er zijn meerdere atleten die het zouden verdienen misschien heb ik deze keer het geluk dat ik al ouder ben en meer spelen op mijn actief heb
2068409 het was wel een beetje moeilijk om het stil te houden ik heb het aan niemand verteld ook niet aan carolijn en ook zelfs niet aan mijn ouders dat was wel een beetje raar ze hebben me nog een paar keer gevraagd of ik dacht dat ik het zou worden maar ik kon niets zeggen en heb enkel geantwoord dat ik er geen idee van had en dat het op 6 augustus zou bekendgemaakt worden dus ik heb eigenlijk een beetje mijn ouders voorgelogen
2068410 we zijn er klaar voor eigenlijk heb ik meer stress voor die vlag dan voor de wedstrijd
2068411 het enige waar we nu mee zitten is dat een aantal tegenstanders de regels tot het uiterste aan het drijven zijn wat bij ons toch voor zenuwachtigheid zorgt een tweetal weken geleden is er plots een nieuwigheid opgedoken en de internationale zeilfederatie heeft nog steeds niet beslist of dat toegelaten zal worden of niet die nieuwigheid is een aanpassing aan het zeil om met de wind mee te gaan zodat er ook tegen de wind mee kan gevaren worden het is vooral ontwikkeld voor lichte weersomstandigheden en naar alle waarschijnlijkheid zal er inderdaad heel weinig wind zijn in qingdao
2068412 maar er is een risico aan verbonden bij lichte wind zullen de boten die ermee varen en dat zullen de nederlanders de amerikanen en waarschijnlijk de australi rs zijn een heel pak sneller zijn maar bij harde wind zijn zij dan in het nadeel hopelijk laat de federatie het niet toe maar deze morgen was er nog steeds geen beslissing genomen
2068413 wij hebben nog niet zo veel ervaring in de tornado en dat zou een te grote stap zijn bovendien zijn we nu heel tevreden over ons materiaal en hebben we uit vorige spelen geleerd dat iets veranderen op twee weken voor de competitie het laatste is wat je moet doen voor de rest zijn we heel blij met hoe we er voor staan we varen nu heel goed in licht weer waar we vroeger bekend stonden als een team voor zwaar weer ik verkies nu zelfs licht weer boven zwaar weer en voor qingdao is dat toch heel geruststellend

2068415 why not really make rock history and open your make rock history contest to bands from around the world
2068416 its time that american artists took a stand with artists from around the world and held out a welcoming hand that could both highlight how great the music scenes are in places we likely wouldnt imagine even have music like death metal hardcore punk or gangsta rap
2068417 bah we would love to enter the contest but then we read all band members must be legal residents of the continental united states
2068418 know which physicians it is effective for sales reps to call on to see which products in our portfolio physicians may have the most interest in

2068421 its exceptional for penguin press to pick up a d but but while the tudor period is probably the most studied of all nobody has written about the final years of henry vii hes thought of as the unsexy tudor compared with his son but tom has identified that he turned england into a police state created a culture of extreme control and paranoia and kept his son under virtual house arrest hes a much more complex and compelling character than has previously been supposed and its an overlooked period

2068428 i never heard brian cowen mention a review at talks but accepted there was not the basis of an agreement
2068429 the most disappointing thing of all was that there was no real attempt by the government to try and deal with the union agenda
2068430 it is very much in the hands of employers it will not wash that people on lower pay should carry the burden we will not engage in a phoney war to bring about some result in september
2068431 he could have set down a marker set out his personal commitments to the process rather than letting officials and mary coughlan who has no track record in this area and no credibility to take the pitch
2068432 as long as there are poles abroad they will send money home and it is of little significance whether the currency is weakening
2068433 the number of accounts opened by poles overseas is growing steadily and so is the number of transfers to poland from abroad
2068434 prepared for the reality that 21 years of social partnership is over
2068435 there would not be any point in bringing us back on the basis of where we finished on the last day something would have to change
2068436 if they had made substantial proposals in those areas it would have coloured the thinking of unions on the pay side
2068437 taking into account todays portfolio sale distribution the initial distribution on february 26th 2008 and the planned future distribution the receivers estimate that holders of uscp or ecp notes will recover approximately 55 per cent of the total redemption price of each uscp and ecp note
2068438 the purpose of todays action is to obtain a definitive ruling from the supreme court that the trustees racially exclusionary admissions policy violates our nations civil rights laws our clients believe and we agree with them that such a ruling will have a significant impact in reversing unfortunate trends toward discrimination and even segregation in hawaii
2068439 there is but one great road to success and that is merit
2068440 slightly more than a century ago the legitimate ruling monarchy of the kingdom of hawai i was overthrown largely due to the interests of american businessmen
2068441 in the years since then the majority of the native population of the hawaiian islands referred to as
2068442 many people would state a direct link between the former and the latter
2068443 if one accepts the points made above it would be understandable to see institutions such as the kamehameha schools viewed as an opportunity to balance out and to some degree rectify the imbalance between the status of kanaka maoli and that of other segments of the islands population
2068444 she wished to establish an institution bearing the name kamehameha for which name she had high respect and preference and a hospital or hospitals and schools for boys and girls were mentioned and in consideration of the queens hospital already established it was decided that schools would be preferred not for boys and girls of pure or part aboriginal blood exclusively but that class should have preference
2068445 create the space for the most reactionary and even fundamentalist religious leaders to take control of minority communities
2068446 when armies walk across bridges they usually break step because if you walk in step you apply that much more force you can actually cause damage by people walking in step
2068447 that got me to thinking if you exerted positive energy at the same time could that have an effect i just thought that it would be great if people focused on orgasms for a day instead of whatever else it wouldnt be a consumer holiday it would be just a day to have fun
2068448 we have seen first hand how asbestos has wreaked havoc on americans working in naval shipyards automobile plants and the construction industry most often this is through their employers conscious choice for profits over a workers health
2068449 youve created and or allowed a world that has hurt me deeply what do you have to say for yourself why should i believe in you anymore
2068450 ok let me explain myself to you as best you can understand it
2068451 i have sinned and fallen short of your glory have mercy on me
2068452 theres evil in the world god if you really exist explain yourself
2068453 listen now and i will speak i will question you and you shall answer me

2068512 senseless directionless mob who enjoy being manipulated by the media
2068513 football fans are always going on and on about loyalty and how players get their heads turned too easily by their agents these fans are f hypocrites
2068514 the fans what about the club as far as i know ronaldo plays for manchester united and the club pay his wages he owes his loyalties to the club and as long as hes playing for united and giving 100 the fans should be backing him 100 as well people especially those who are easily manipulated by the bs were spoon fed everyday forget that the player as well as the staff at the club were on vacations during different times in the last two months ronaldos had a tough year hes taken his time off as he deserved hes then talked to the gaffer and they obviously decided that the final decision would be announced once he returned to the club so he goes off has his operation takes some time off and then comes back to the club as scheduled and says hes responsible for the mess and that hell stay of his own accord and will give his 100 to the club sure you can say he has no choice but shouldnt actions speak louder than words he had a choice he could have thrown a tantrum and embarrassed himself and the club but hes dealt with it very professionally whats left is to get fit and then perform for the club as long as he does that the fans should be rooting for him not complaining like jealous girlfriends
2068515 look at the gareth barry situation look at how ashley cole and william gallas treated their clubs when they werent allowed a move look at how robinhos agent is criticising madrid look at how rafael van der vaart offers himself to top european clubs ever summer look at how some of the chairmen at different clubs are behaving look at adebayor for f sake when you look at the numerous transfer sagas that have ended in acrimony youll come to realise that cristiano ronaldo has been remarkably professional and respectful in his dealings
2068516 theyve stoked the fires and let everything else run its course they knew the english press would piss itself silly trying to fill column inches on the story and when the shit lords of uk went ahead and did exactly that the fans minds were poisoned and now they just dont care any more its a very sad state of affairs i hope ronaldo can win the fans back although a lot of it will depend on what happens the next time the fake madrid come knocking the fans are just as if not more fickle than the players
2068517 the fans what about the club as far as i know ronaldo plays for manchester united and the club pay his wages

2068523 the strongest indication i can give you is that we want to pass on an interest rate cut if funding costs allow
2068524 at the end of the day were a commercial organisation
2068525 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time
2068526 i say to the commercial banks in australia that they have a responsibility to ensure that action by the reserve bank is reflected in the interest rate posture adopted by those commercial banks
2068527 where they are increasing interest rates which are not in line with peoples expectations of what they are reasonably able to do in variable home loans then perhaps they are engaging in unfair or even unconscionable conduct

2068568 one of the problems is that a lot of people dont realize that they are having a stroke
2068569 there still needs to be a lot of education in the community for people to recognize these symptoms and when you recognize them call 911
2068570 there is also delay time among people who get to the hospital quickly so there is room for the medical community to act
2068571 once you get there you need to be diagnosed theres a very narrow window in which you can get treatment
2068572 we found that women were less likely to get timely treatment
2068573 also treatment was faster in hospitals that were certified stroke centers which have a formal plan for diagnosis and treatment

2068608 leading indicators for an above normal season during 2008 include the continuing multi decadal signal atmospheric and oceanic conditions that have spawned increased hurricane activity since 1995 and the lingering effects of la ni a
2068609 some of these conditions include reduced wind shear weaker trade winds an active west african monsoon system the winds coming off of africa and warmer than average water in the atlantic ocean
2068610 it is critical that everyone know the risk for your area and have a plan to protect yourself your family and your property or to evacuate if requested by local emergency managers be prepared throughout the remainder of the hurricane season

2068626 lets just say that there were many people who were skeptical of us and of what we were doing in rockaway
2068627 there were about four or five new churches of different denominations that had attempted to start churches in rockaway beach right before bridge of faith got there every last one of them failed
2068628 they didnt see a difference between us and those other churches so we had to prove that what we were about is what we said we were about no hidden agendas
2068629 we had to be careful because a broken promise was a broken promise to them
2068630 it wouldnt matter if it was a legitimate reason or not all the community would know is that a promise was made and a promise was broken
2068631 i became the vice president of the chamber of commerce and through that i got to know many of the city leaders and business leaders in the community
2068632 the community started hearing about the positive things we are doing and they have come around
2068633 we have had an average of 60 kids for wednesday night youth group

2068638 they chose to make this a test case but they never imagined that it would result in such a stunning rebuff
2068639 the government attempted to inflame the emotions of the panel
2068640 asking for 30 years to life not only was ill advised and wholly inappropriate but was also soundly rejected by the panel
2068641 it was all for show if mr hamdan does not go home in december
2068642 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2068643 i can reassure you that the defense department is hard at work on this issue
2068644 the decision showed what the jury thought hamdan was worth
2068645 there is a perception that trying people in front of the military was going to be a rubber stamp process
2068646 this shows they are conscientious following instructions and are making rational decisions
2068647 its true there are work opportunities in yemen but not at the level i needed after i got married and not to the level of ambitions that i had in my future
2068648 i personally present my apologies to them if anything that i did has caused them pain
2068649 you have found him guilty of offenses that have made our world extremely unsafe and dangerous
2068650 the government asks you to deliver a sentence that will absolutely keep our society safe from him

2068657 as a young guy it is a big honor for me to play at the opening ceremony and to represent a new generation of chinese people to the world
2068658 im part of a new generation in china enjoying a very different way of life from our parents we love american culture and classical music but we also have strong chinese traditions
2068659 i fell in love with music and never looked back
2068660 i prefer to live in new york because no matter who you are there you wont be mobbed in china now everybody knows me
2068661 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2068662 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2068663 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2068664 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2068665 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2068666 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2068667 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2068668 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal

2068676 een professor van de vrije universiteit te amsterdam zei deze fiets verdient de nobelprijs en ik zal u zeggen waarom oudere mensen gaan minder bewegen hardlopen is niet aan de orde dan krijgen ze blessures ook trappen op een normale fiets kan een te zware belasting zijn maar op een elektrische fiets kun je tot in lengte van jaren rijden
2068677 deel die prijs eens door het aantal kilometers dat je rijdt dan blijft er bijna niks over de moderne elektrische fiets gaat eindeloos mee en de autokilometers die je bespaart
2068678 op mijn huidige fiets rij ik al sinds mijn tienerjaren ruim veertig jaar dus dan mag je de beurs wel weer eens trekken h

2068696 never had any intention of carrying out the agreement with my client
2068697 since i found out that nationals were at the same time as the olympics i have wanted to win this race
2068698 yes the three best time trialists are in beijing right now but i have to take advantage of it if i can so since january this has been my number one goal
2068699 so it was good to know that i was coming along
2068700 we drove it two days ago and i liked it right away
2068701 the longer the course is the more it works in my favor and we rode it yesterday and i liked it the first 7k was really hard and then there was a section that was really fast you could find a really nice rhythm and then of course the big hill after the turnaround but i knew the last 5 to 7k would be gradual uphill and you just had to wait save a little bit in the tank because that was really gonna hurt
2068702 the climbing came so close to the beginning that the climb potentially could have been more decisive if the course had been reversed and the hill was at the end
2068703 everyones fresh going into that climb so its not as much of an advantage for me as it would have been later in the course
2068704 i got here this morning and was like i might as well give it a try so its pretty exciting
2068705 my uncle actually lives about five miles away so whenever i want warm weather training like in the winter i come here
2068706 i know all these roads the town and all the restaurants and all that the only thing that could have been better was if it was in my hometown
2068707 but i havent been able to crack the top spot so its about time
2068708 i know the guy who got third today taylor sheldon he started 30 seconds ahead of me
2068709 he was really strong always kicked my butt in time trials he was a good rabbit to have and my goal was to catch him early get him fast and i knew id be having a good ride if i could do that and then at the turn i saw i had a lot of time on nick frey des moines iowa time pro cycling who was the defending champ and started 1 minute behind him so i just put my head down to the finish i felt really good
2068710 because my bike broke right at the start of the time trial and i crashed in the road race this makes the entire year worth it now
2068711 ive been sick for the past two weeks i just went out there and did my thing the best i could but i felt really slow
2068712 its been kind of an on and off season for time trialing for me
2068713 i had a couple of dry spells and then junior worlds didnt go the greatest for me so when i came into this race i just came in giving it everything i had left to just prove i can still race i worked really hard for this so its just nice to have hard work pay off
2068714 i knew i always had the power and a big engine
2068715 it was just a matter of learning how to get in the right position to show that
2068716 current tax treatment of housing is intended to benefit working families but it actually creates bad outcomes the reality is current tax law distorts the economy promotes house price speculation renders households over indebted and financially vulnerable and undermines wages and family structure there is a better way to help working families afford decent housing and now is a good time for policy to transition in that direction

2068725 he had left babylon on april 8 and came to jerusalem on august 4 for the gracious hand of his god was on him this was because ezra had determined to study and obey the law of the lord and to teach those laws and regulations to the people of israel
2068726 because ezra had determined to study and obey the law of the lord and to teach those laws and regulations to the people of israel
2068727 so be careful not to jump to conclusions before the lord returns as to whether or not someone is faithful when the lord comes he will bring our deepest secrets to light and will reveal our private motives and then god will give to everyone whatever praise is due
2068728 for the kingdom of god is not just fancy talk it is living by gods power
2068729 sing to the lord you saints of his praise his holy name for his anger lasts only a moment but his favor lasts a lifetime weeping may remain for a night but rejoicing comes in the morning
2068730 the glory of the young is their strength the gray hair of experience is the splendor of the old
2068731 let a man regard us in this manner as servants of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god
2068732 in relation to the master of the house the steward was a slave but in relation to the other slaves the steward was a master a steward never owned the property or resource he dealt with he simply managed them for his master and had to manage them faithfully
2068733 can or should every christian today have the same attitude should we have no or little regard for what other christians think about us and just say he who judges me is the lord we can only say this in the full sense that paul means it if we are apostles if the corinthians were to claim that paul could not judge them and that they would simply wait for gods judgment paul would remind them that he is a father to them and has the right to correct their behavior
2068734 many people today evaluate a pastor or a minister on unbiblical standards they judge him on the basis of his humor or entertainment value his appearance or his skill at marketing and sales but this is to think beyond what is written in the sense paul means it here
2068735 because they didnt have printing back then paul couldnt just hand out bibles people had to learn the gospel by watching his life maybe that wasnt so bad after all
2068736 what a great nation so wise so understanding weve never seen anything like it

2068739 if we are content to suffer the will does not act sin is not there as to fact for to suffer is not will it is grace acting in accordance with the image and the mind of christ in the new man and we are freed from the action of the old man it i e old man does not act we rest from it we have done with it no longer to live for the remainder of our life here below in the flesh according to the lusts of man but according to the will of god which the new man follows

2068744 the flurry of journeys discussions suggestions to hijack the president and commander in chief of the federal republic of nigeria while in his presidential jet to knock out armoured vehicles at ikeja cantonment the funding of these journeys or programmes smear campaign against the president and commander in chief of the armed forces etc are all tantamount to levying war jointly or in agreement against the state of nigeria it is pretty clear to the tribunal that maj gen vatsa the poet and rich author and soldier and intelligent man knew what he was doing not only was he financing the plot he was masterminding it
2068745 clearly the impulsive psychological mechanism of a person who has something to hide
2068746 i heard of the 1983 coup planning told my goc general buhari who detained me for two weeks in lagos instead of a part on the back i received a stab how then do you expect me to report this one this trial marks the eclipse of my brilliant and unblemished career of 19 years i fought in the civil war with the ability it pleased god to give me if is unfortunate that im being convicted for something which i have had to stop on two occasions this is not self adulation but a sincere summary of the qualities inherent in me it is an irony of fate that the president of the tribunal who in 1964 felt that i was good enough to take training in the u k is now saddled with the duty of showing me the exit from the force and the world
2068747 i gave this tribunal a pr cis of my cv
2068748 i request you to bear in mind that i have never nursed any political ambition that is not in accordance with the norms of the profession and the laws of the land for the periods that the military has been in government it was only in the past two years as from december 31 st 1983 that i have participated in the running of government i have been a full time soldier all my military life this is the path of honour i have chosen for myself i would request the honourable tribunal to consider that i have never nursed grudges against anyone i have always tried to be frank with my colleagues it is my way it is the way of our training you have made your decision that i am guilty i cant question your right to say so as a tribunal however i shall remain my witness before your judgment and the testimony before its justice before you pass your sentence on me i will like you to keep the lessons in view still yet this sentence shall not be my final hour for i have gods promise on that gods judgment is the last may i appeal to you to also take note that i am a married man with family i have other dependants that i have the obligation of looking after i will like to think that by the time you finish with me my children shall be so scared of the system that they shall never come near it for a lean liberty is better than a fat slavery

2068804 i think that the important thing now is not just that things get smartened up and more acceptable for the olympics but this is an opportunity for china to say to the rest of the world we were privileged by having the olympics and we as a country are going to begin change that will last well beyond the olympics
2068805 this is why i think international dialogue has got to continue after the olympics
2068806 perhaps the intensity of concern about issues in relation to tibet human rights in china media freedom particularly media freedom for chinese journalists not just western journalists is something it is important we all continue to pursue in dialogue with the chinese government

2068815 theres very little question what the end of the road is for omar khadr if the canadian government doesnt intervene and demand omars release from guantanamo to face due process in a canadian court
2068816 the fact that hamdan could be acquitted and still not released makes arguments over the trial rules more than a little absurd
2068817 but convicting someone with unfair rules cant ever be just
2068818 any verdict resulting from such a flawed system is a betrayal of american values
2068819 hamdan is probably guilty and probably a real terrorist but what is unfortunate is that instead of having a real conviction in a real court we have this very dubious process
2068820 while it is important to convict anyone who provides material support for terrorism it is long past time to capture or kill osama bin laden

2068847 the leafs blueline has grown more cluttered with newcomers free agent jeff finger signed with the leafs and the team is working out a contract offer for swedish rearguard jonas frogren bryan mccabe is under contract but will likely not return but the club retains tomas kaberle pavel kubina anton stralman ian white and carlo colaiacovo
2068848 6 do the leafs trade pavel kubina his contractual window for a trade closes on august 15 okay this one i can answer i take cliff fletcher at his word when he says he will have the bryan mccabe issue resolved at or around training camp fletcher is also saying there is a less than 50 per cent chance he will move kubina that leaves kubina and tomas kaberle as the teams number one unit with a hodgepodge of finger white jonas frogren if they can square his contract with the league anton stralman carlo colaiacovo possibly luke schenn and perhaps a toronto marlie lots of teams are looking for players who can play nearly half the game and anchor the power play mccabe will bring some return with a numerically thin defence kubina becomes too valuable to move especially if sundin does not return and the leafs find themselves with abundant cap room

2069063 but until things are signed and stamped ill make sure we keep on top of this
2069064 to me the clover valley foundation lawsuit could potentially save the entire valley so i think its important for that to continue on also
2069065 i dont see how this change is going to affect those impacts

2069068 american families are being crushed by high gasoline prices small businesses are being damaged and yet the speaker of the house will not call us back here to deal with the number one issue in the country now 834 days ago then minority leader of the house nancy pelosi said i have a common sense plan to lower gas prices 834 days weve still not seen this plan about 108 days ago on april 22nd this year i sent the speaker a letter asking to see the common sense plan to lower gas prices ive yet to receive a response the american people sent us here to represent their interest were here and were going to continue to be here day after day until the speaker calls us back because thats what our constituents are demanding were here representing their interests
2069069 our message to speaker nancy pelosi is this call this congress back into session immediately and give the bipartisan majority of men and women in this congress who support more drilling more conservation more alternative sources of energy a vote our message to our colleagues in the house democratic conference is this join us we know many house democrats believe in a comprehensive energy strategy that would give the american people more access to our own domestic reserves we invite you to call on your own speaker to bring this congress back into session we invite you to come to this floor and join us on behalf of the american people
2069070 i felt from the very beginning everything we have done is correct
2069071 we cant continue to talk and talk and talk without results
2069072 like i said the motivation just being dead last i guess like going out there knowing youre probably going to lose isnt motivating thats tough thats tough for me

2069074 portland is a very exemplary city for a lot of things
2069075 but not for homeless people right now we need to help them not say oh because youre homeless youre a piece of shit youre a piece of garbage
2069076 i spent my time serving so that people could sit and sleep on the streets and now were told we cant do that the problem with this law is that homeless people have been around for thousands of years and no matter what you do youre not going to get rid of them were being told suddenly that theres no place to lay your head my suggestion would be to have the politicians live on the street for a month
2069077 i think the sit lie ordinance is a social status thing and i dont think its fair
2069078 people who are working on their lunch breaks come out on the sidewalks and they talk and nobodys targeting people like them theyre criminalizing people who are homeless it used to be that the government was for the people we can voice our opinion we can protest but we need other people to step up and help us because if they can do this to us they can do it to you too
2069079 the ordinance makes it illegal to be sleeping and homeless
2069080 and thats not okay i would have to hear something new and compelling to renew and continue this
2069081 i think the testimony is compelling from folks on the street
2069082 and i hope they show up to the safe oversight committees hearing on monday
2069083 i dont have all the answers but i think it is important to consider the perspective of these folks when we try to decide what to do with this ordinance
2069084 to hear people talk directly about theyre experiencing what its like to be on the street and not have a place to go while the city has been making great efforts to deal with the issue in terms of the 10 year plan to end homelessness i think we need to recognize were heading into a very different economic time

2069155 obamas claiming that putting air in your tires is the equivalent of new offshore drilling thats not an energy plan my friends thats a public service announcement
2069156 we need to drill offshore here and now when we exploit and find these new reserves of oil it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil thats just a fact when you increase supply the price of whatever it is will go down
2069157 obama might be a little bit confused yesterday he accused me of having president bushs policies on energy thats odd because he voted for the presidents energy bill and i voted against it

2069167 the star wars films have always been stellar examples of visionary visual effects seeing these effects paired with computer animation and the behind the scenes knowledge from dave filoni will be an incredible experience for fans and film professionals alike
2069168 as the field of computer graphics matures we will continue to see graphics practitioners take on novel challenges that were not even considered just a few years ago
2069169 the modeling and animation techniques used in spore will inspire others to think more creatively about user created content in computer games
2069170 i started with the soundtrack by mixing and re pitching various abstract sounds that i recorded
2069171 the idea being to create music from noises then i procedurally animated numerous abstract 3d objects to the track these animations are then used as source imagery to my 3d noise shaders which have parameters that animate to the soundtrack as well the camera travels through the resulting animated evolving volume i went back and forth between the sound and visuals as i would stumble upon cool moments in each and wanted to tie them together so that every sound event had a visual event and vice versa
2069172 one of the really interesting sets of papers are on what i characterize as gradient based illustration techniques
2069173 they offer very powerful techniques for image creation and editing the applications are as compelling as painting i expect these ideas to move from academia to the artist within a couple years
2069174 who would have guessed that face manipulation would be a trend this year
2069175 we look for novelty technical advancements the highest quality results
2069176 and the wow factor some people do things youd never think of like the bizarre self animating image
2069177 one that im excited about is a piece on digital cinematography
2069178 we have pixar and blue sky giving their approaches to cinematography and setting up camera rigs for wall e and horton and some work from ilm on their digital environments in indiana jones its an eye cracker on monday morning at 8 30 but ill be there and friday is character td day

2069180 a fairly large group of us were having lunch during the jury meeting for the content of siggraph 08 and one person lamented that at the conference we go absorb information sit passively and listen and then leave were not creating anything we in this case refers to the research community so we talked about it
2069181 its totally freeform but i imagine people will exchange information at the meeting arrange to meet and in the meantime think about the problem
2069182 well give them problems that are grand in nature not something you could solve by writing a paper
2069183 this is a process that starts four years in advance and requires macro and micro management skills
2069184 also the roles that the chair has to fill are mind bogglingly vast

2069186 we have an excellent collection of robotics demos and of course takeo kanade is a featured speaker presenting
2069187 its programmed as a true festival with not only screenings but also production sessions festival talks an entire 3d stereo cinematography track production studio evenings and a festival awards session
2069188 los angeles is really an incredibly popular city with attendees
2069189 that would be like saying the people who contribute and attend could grow to have too much passion and enthusiasm for their work
2069190 when i started my research position less than two years ago i was already deep into the conference planning cycle for 2008 and my managers have been extremely supportive
2069191 one of the exciting projects that they asked me to join within my first months was an academy of technology study on the future of research we interviewed researchers and lab directors both internal and external to ibm in industry and academia we asked them what they saw on the horizon for the next 10 years not just in terms of research topics but also in terms of the way people will be working in research environments our findings were very rich and we aim to publish our final report at the end of this year
2069192 we wanted to keep whats worked in the past but also push ourselves by making a more a festival environment for cg
2069193 it was really kinda supposed to be a quick peek
2069194 but as is the nature of a rabbitholes display once you turn the lights on well i warned him this place was going to go crazy
2069195 many of these cutting edge technologies exemplify how our past informs our future and how it affects the upcoming opportunities and challenges of computer graphics and interactive techniques
2069196 the technologies and installations in new tech demos encourage people to engage with the future as well as celebrate our past as we invigorate explore and define our potential
2069197 i feel like ive become more of a performer now more comfortable on stage
2069198 i feel like im putting on my best show at this point in my career because i have three records
2069199 im more experienced i have more singles and i can have more of a variety to pick from its diverse we have a lot of fun up there
2069200 i wrote the record thinking about my tour and knowing the songs i like playing live the most
2069201 i mean of course youre going to have some markets youre weak in thats normal for everyone
2069202 but i just played a show wednesday night in toronto for i dont know 10 000 people and i was there just four months ago playing to 14 000 people
2069203 i cant believe that im on my third record and i still get to go up on stage and play for people every night whether its 15 000 people i wouldnt even care if it was like 200 people

2069207 i love it in reading keeping holiday chronicles of narnia it is delightful reading that pulls you into the adventures of dylan and clare and tells the story of gods work in the lives of those who are called according to his purpose children from 8 to 78 will be captivated by this spellbinding story
2069208 there is more to holiday than meets the eye and more to this book than a story that will doubtless enthrall young readers in the spirit of c s lewis starr meade leads us and our children to christ through the wonderful medium of imagination
2069209 this charming story should be repeatedly read and savored it has the enduring and endearing quality of a good story it lingers it causes one to ponder gospel truth and to celebrate the holy one of holiday

2069212 they were all picked up and are being questioned at the moment
2069213 nobody is happy with the present situation but most people know from experience that protests will not change their lives
2069214 this anniversary is testament to the burmese peoples enduring demand for freedom and to the worlds failure to end repressive military rule
2069215 and china more than any other country has enabled the survival of the brutal burmese regime
2069216 china will continue to follow a good neighborly policy towards myanmar and work with the international community to help myanmar overcome difficulties
2069217 the american people care deeply about the people of burma and dream for the day the people will be free
2069218 this seems like a perfect combination of hulk meets conan the barbarian i think this book is in great hands paks and i look forward to see where he goes with it i think this book will have big characters and big fights
2069219 skaar son of hulk is an interesting beast of a comic i just want to recommend trying it and letting it breath and grow its sort of a barbarian story machine the art works it creates a very raw look that connects very effectively to the emotional core of the story

2069237 there is obviously concern about how hurricane activity might change in the future
2069238 by studying how it has varied naturally in the past we can better understand the underlying factors that affect hurricane development
2069239 fortunately we can turn to the geologic record to extend our understanding of hurricane activity further looking back 1 000 years or more
2069240 lower mystic lake offered a fantastic opportunity for a boston area record because each year is represented by a discrete layer of sediment called a varve that accumulates at the bottom of the lake
2069241 you can count these varves like tree rings to go back in time
2069242 a hurricane strike often causes vegetation disturbance and tree blow down which exposes lots of fresh loose sediment
2069243 the intense precipitation associated with hurricanes picked up the sediment and deposited it in the lake to form the graded beds containing coarser sediment that we see
2069244 long term records like those from mystic lake provide climate modelers with a way of testing if their understanding of changes in hurricane activity over time are correct
2069245 if their models can reproduce the past record correctly we have more confidence in their simulations of future changes

2069260 it is well known that human choices are affected by the way in which a question is phrased
2069261 our study provides neurobiological evidence that an amygdala based emotional system underpins this biasing of human decisions moreover we found that people are rational or irrational to widely differing amounts interestingly the amygdala was active across all participants regardless of whether they behaved rationally or irrationally suggesting that everyone experiences an emotional reaction when faced with such choices however we found that more rational individuals had greater activation in their orbitofrontal cortex a region of prefrontal cortex suggesting that rational individuals are able to better manage or perhaps override their emotional responses
2069262 irrational behaviour arises as a consequence of emotional reactions evoked when faced with difficult decisions
2069263 our study provides neurobiological evidence that an amygdala based emotional system underpins this biasing of human decisions moreover we found that people are rational or irrational to widely differing amounts interestingly the amygdala was active across all participants regardless of whether they behaved rationally or irrationally suggesting that everyone experiences an emotional reaction when faced with such choices however we found that more rational individuals had greater activation in their orbitofrontal cortex a region of prefrontal cortex suggesting that rational individuals are able to better manage or perhaps override their emotional responses

2069284 i think one important fact here is that no taxpayer went to fund that 5 million
2069285 there wasnt enough insurance coverage and theres no amount of money that can compensate mrs barnes and her family for the loss of judge barnes life
2069286 we recognized judge barnes sterling reputation and our own affection for him and for his widow when considering our fees
2069287 i didnt think it was fair to judge mather and the county to stay on during the trial
2069288 but i do think claudia barnes had an exceptionally strong case
2069289 there are issues of whether workmans compensation is an exclusive remedy and of qualified immunity
2069290 the settlement just shows how the defendants view their liability in these cases
2069291 i believe we will prove our cases at trial and get a substantial award for our clients
2069292 looks like the voters have had enough of sheriff freeman as well
2069293 fulton county has been turning its back on these victims for three years
2069294 so its nice to see it start paying some attention to them for a change
2069295 when one case settles that can give the other attorneys and plaintiffs an idea of the value of the other cases
2069296 the best strategy to me is to continue to prepare for trial and be ready to go to trial
2069297 when that is done in a professional and competent way it puts the plaintiff in the best possible position even in the event that there is a settlement offer if not youre in the best position for trial
2069298 as a lawyer and somebody who knew and cared about rowland barnes and who knows claudia i am happy to hear that this chapter of that sad story is coming to a close

2069313 in blessing mother earth and her skies we are celebrating and empowering feminine energies the grandmothers say these prayers are healing and returning the original beauty and sweetness back to all womens hearts

2069330 es un contagio que lleva meses porque estuvimos aqu hace unos meses y el ayuntamiento de pek n y el bocog comit organizador nos ense aron todos los preparativos para un alcalde es fascinante c mo ha cambiado la realidad de una ciudad como consecuencia de los juegos y estoy absolutamente convencido de que hoy empiezan unos juegos formidables y en los que la delegaci n espa ola lograr unos grandes resultados
2069331 nosotros lo que queremos es multiplicar por dos el fetiche chino del ocho pasar a que 2016 sea nuestro a o
2069332 son dos realidades muy distintas madrid est preparada no s lo para celebrar unos juegos sino para convivir con ellos sin necesidad de adoptar medidas extraordinarias como pek n es evidente que madrid no tendr que cerrar sus industrias ni establecer en agosto de 2016 medidas especiales de tr fico
2069333 los datos podr n confirmar que somos una ciudad que sin necesidad de medidas extraordinarias estamos perfectamente preparados para celebrar los juegos con todo hemos aprendido mucho de pek n y de lo que significa el compromiso del gobierno de una naci n con el esfuerzo deportivo de una ciudad y la implicaci n de la ciudad que ha tenido transformaciones muy importantes en su vida cotidiana y que no s lo no ha generado molestias sino que se ha convertido en un motivo de celebraci n
2069334 el coi ha dicho algo muy importante y es que madrid est en condiciones de organizar unos juegos han cambiado cosas el informe fue muy positivo y se nos traslad algunos criterios que a juicio del coi podr an incorporarse para mejorar la candidatura de madrid 2016
2069335 es el momento en el que podemos ver a m s miembros del coi y trasladarles nuestra realidad madrid tiene la enorme ventaja de que no tiene que disimular su candidatura y no tiene nada que esconder ni exagerar nuestro proyecto es v lido y ganador estamos percibiendo un enorme inter s por parte del coi
2069336 no ha habido motivos para someter a una revisi n esa decisi n la experiencia nos dice que la celebraci n de los juegos siempre ha tra do m s apertura y libertad a los pa ses que los han acogido estoy convencido que como consecuencia de lo que est ocurriendo china se convertir en un pa s m s abierto m s respetuoso con los derechos humanos y que incorporar esos valores democr ticos de convivencia a sus comportamientos internos
2069337 samaranch es la esencia de madrid 16 es la persona que nos convoc hace muchos a os para iniciar este esfuerzo y el que nos ha abierto las puertas y ense ado el camino cuando en copenhague madrid consiga los juegos ser al que agradecer en primer lugar el haberlo hecho
2069338 marcamos los tiempos desde el primer momento aunque es verdad que no lo compartimos porque en nuestra estrategia estaba decir sin ser sometidos a presiones externas cu ndo ten amos que anunciarlo pero le puedo asegurar que nosotros salimos de singapur convencidos de que hab amos puesto las bases para que madrid consiguiese los juegos ol mpicos en 2016
2069339 madrid va a ganar y cuando gane madrid no va a ser una victoria de gallard n ser una victoria de todos instituciones administraciones medios de comunicaci n y ciudadanos se es el escenario que contemplamos el compartir la victoria no compartir de la derrota entonces habr tenido la inmensa suerte de poder estar al frente de la ciudad cuando se alcance el triunfo pero el triunfo ser de todos

2069557 when we come to weigh the rights of the several sorts of property which can be held by man and in this judgment take into consideration only the absolute question of justice leaving out the limitations of expediency and prejudice it will be clearly seen that intellectual property is after all the only absolute possession in the world the man who brings out of the nothingness the child of his thoughts has rights therein which cannot belong to any other sort of property land or chattels are pre existing in some form and the rights therein are limited in many ways and are held in the great service of the world but the inventor of a book or other contrivance of thought holds his property as a god holds it by right of creation with his silence or inaction the sustenance and advance of millions yet to be may vanish into the great darkness again his brain has brought the seed out of the infinite planted it in good soil tended it with the care that only the sower can feel surely the world should not deny him a share of the increase he has brought about and if he giving the reversion of his property for all time to his race is granted the product of his creation for half a score of years he should surely be secured against being plundered by the law as well as by the lawless

2069570 less than 10 percent of centers surveyed have the capability to measure lifetime value and only 18 percent of centers use customer profitability as a metric
2069571 id bet that the survey is skewed toward low wage countries thats important because i expect a lot of bad management habits are causing the problems the survey surfaces

2069596 its been a little bit crazy the paper market which was previously rock solid has followed the physical market down
2069597 not a lot of love has been lost or gained in the capesize market this week its all gone sour very very quickly
2069598 i think its been very much a realisation that in fact the physical picture is substantially worse than people had given it credit for
2069599 the baltic exchange index which had started to fall by 1 000 or 1 500 per day is now dropping by 5 000 7 000 and now 10 000
2069600 this was enough to prompt the realisation that its not a pretty picture out there and there is not an awful lot of cargo coming into the market so its been a real nose dive
2069601 but really its probably a short term bounce and the possibility is for further falling

2069609 this can be because last years figure of 2 3 was abnormally low
2069610 it is hard to draw any positive conclusion from the figure that we see today because its only one time we cant say if it can be sustained for the next months

2069617 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2069618 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2069619 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2069620 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2069621 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2069622 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2069623 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2069624 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system
2069625 i think honestly that im better than he is in every single aspect of the game
2069626 i just have a very stubborn attitude where i wont allow myself to fail
2069627 its my turn to start my legacy and my reign
2069628 he fitch has good cardio he trains hard but hes built to go medium for a long period of time so he can keep going at a good pace for a very long time but he cant go at a very very high pace for a long time georges has more power more athletic ability so georges can go explode and then recover explode and recover fitch is like strong steady just plodding along basically what he does is he wears you out over time georges is explosive
2069629 every time i talk to fitch and his camp theyre very confident they can beat gsp
2069630 he thinks people dont realize how tough he is until they fight him hes going to get in there hes going to outwork gsp and grind out a win
2069631 when i talk to people about how they feel about gsp basically what people think is gsp eats wrestlers alive chews them up and spits them out and that has been his track record and he seems very mentally there very strong mentally on top of his game
2069632 im not really that good of a wrestler im a good fighter but to stereotype me as a wrestler is foolish a little bit so i hope hes considering me just a wrestler because then hes in for a rude awakening on saturday night
2069633 the way i explain it to people is if brazilian jiu jitsu was a banana split then guerilla jiu jitsu is a banana split with whipped cream on top hot fudge nuts and a cherry
2069634 jon fitch hes like a new breed of mixed martial arts fighter hes not like the old school guys of course hes a great wrestler thats his first background but hes very good standing up and on the ground as well so he brings a lot more problems to the table than the other guys ive fought in the past im going to have to use a lot more tools than ive been using in the past but i truly believe that fighting wrestlers is my speciality thats the type of people that im the best to fight when i fight wrestlers i always do very well
2069635 the top level guys the guys that are at the top are professionals or behaving as professionals the guys who talk trash and the guys who spew all that garbage they dont last they do that stuff because they need that to get attention because they suck as fighters
2069636 i think jon fitch poses a whole bunch of problems for georges st pierre
2069637 he does a lot of things well that georges does well hes a solid wrestler hes really great at scrambling he has good standup and he has good submissions so theres no one area where i really feel that georges can go out there and exploit jon fitch i think its just going to boil down to who has the better fight on that night
2069638 jon fitch is no pushover at all i think some people are writing him off but jon fitch i tell you he does everything that gsp can do i just think gsp may just have an edge kind of everywhere
2069639 youve got a guy whos a little more polished in robinson like georges youve got a guy thats beating everybody like lamotta did
2069640 temos sempre a consci ncia de que no futebol os resultados que ditam o conceito que se tem de uma equipe por isso n o nos iludimos com as vit rias e sabemos que a caminhada ser muito longa e complicada neste campeonato brasileiro
2069641 o botafogo tem time para brigar na parte de cima da tabela mas n o podemos nos deixar levar pelos bons resultados pois as cr ticas vir o com os maus resultados
2069642 o nosso grupo retomou a confian a que foi perdida com alguns maus resultados no in cio do brasileiro e pela perda do t tulo estadual e da copa do brasil as coisas melhoraram e al m disso o nosso plantel est mais forte a postura de todos diferente e mesmo quando sofremos com desfalques conseguimos nos impor em campo foi assim no 3 a 0 contra o atl tico paranaense quando entramos sem cinco titulares
2069643 as produ es est o muito mal ramos o terceiro exportador de carne do mundo e atualmente estamos em oitavo lugar o brasil fez um grande esfor o para ter uma pol tica conseguir resultados o primeiro exportador de carne no mundo e avan a a grandes passos at o uruguai um pa s pequeno quando comparado ao nosso argentina est exportando mais carne que n s porque tem uma pol tica agropecu ria implementada n s n o temos
2069644 uma posi o sem l gica cristina fala de redistribui o de riqueza mas deveria saber que para redistribu las preciso produzi la nesse momento o que estamos fazendo repartindo pobreza temos 11 milh es de pobres na argentina a pobreza est aumentando e isso fruto de m s pol ticas n o culpa do campo
2069645 isso gera conseq ncias primeiro deixaremos de exportar e depois teremos que deixar de consumir
2069646 preocupante e imposs vel produzir nessas condi es uma inseguridade pol tica que se cria e que n o faz nenhum sentido e n o existe em nenhum pa s do mundo
2069647 ive been in the chase the last two years so i know what its like to be involved in the chase and all the media hoopla and everything else thats brought around it
2069648 you have to deal with all of that once you get to the racetrack every week you have to be able to deal with making your car the fastest and try to go out there and finish well and not have any problems
2069649 i dont know if hes had bad luck in the past 10 weeks or what where he hasnt won that much but hes been fast every single place weve been to hes always a threat for the win the 48 johnson has definitely stepped it up theyve come a long way and theyre a lot better now its just a product of trying to make your equipment better and they have
2069650 whether you win or run out of gas and finish 36th it doesnt matter at this point
2069651 we tried it last week and it seemed as though it was working better than what we thought it would from practice
2069652 we changed some stuff before the race we were running from about 12th to fifth all day and there at the end of the race we had a chance to run fourth and miscalculated fuel mileage or didnt get it full on the last stop and finished 36th we tried it there and well see what happens here this weekend on how fast we can run here
2069653 we are excited about the way the year has been going
2069654 its been a pretty phenomenal season for us weve had seven wins and weve been able to run up front and capitalize on some good times weve also had a couple bad runs hopefully we can just keep it going in the right direction and try to get everything we can possible for the chase and start over there and have a good run over there
