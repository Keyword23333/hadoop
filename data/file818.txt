8180000 but playing hard and grinding it out thats automatic as bad a player as i was i could still hustle im not worried about that at all
8180001 this is a tough time of year you have to push yourself even at that youre whistling dixie if you think that teams as good as the white sox and twins have been are going to lose eight or nine in a row thats not going to happen
8180002 its very unlikely both of them are going to go into some fantastic funk
8180003 a lot of times when teams go through what theyve gone through the hungry players get a chance to prove themselves those are dangerous teams
8180004 but cleveland is going to be right back in the thick of things next year hopefully well be the same way
8180005 hell be pitching against guys like grady sizemore he doesnt have to get cliff lee out
8180006 but on the other side he has to get more aggressive in rbi situations
8180007 i felt i threw only one bad slider out of six and i know what i did wrong on the bad one
8180008 he has about 250 at bats and about 40 rbi
8180009 if he gets 400 at bats knocks in 70 runs and catches well thats a very valuable guy but you can see the toll that catching takes on a guy
8180010 those who see nudity will be happy with sherlyns dard
8180011 its the video very hot haan my god i dont even know why shes sherlyns linking me with a hot hot thing shes trying to change her image maybe with my name if shes doing this poor thing i wish her success for all those who see nudity will be happy but my name is hema malini and that wont change for anything
8180012 ive known hemaji as a wonderful person and if she says sherlyn is promoting nudity on her name i dare not contest her opinion after all the video did receive 19 cuts from the censor board if sherlyn has a diva like image she cant help it you cant ask a madonna to be like an alka yagnik can you
8180013 see sherlyn made this video as a tribute to hemajis
8180014 it was a coincidence that we shot the dahi handi sequence on the janmashtami eve
8180015 when i had to break the handi i was thrilled and everyone on the set was also excited there were six pyramids and i had to climb up and break the handi though its a first time for me but i did it with full confidence
8180016 they played the nasik dhol and dance with them i happily agreed to be a part of the festive mood
8180017 we had to leave the house before it got worse
8180018 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days
8180019 im not too happy about it because i needed to get paid today
8180020 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
8180021 independientemente de si votaron por m o por barack ha llegado el momento de unirnos en un nico partido con una nica causa estamos en el mismo equipo y ninguno de nosotros se puede quedar al margen

8180023 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories
8180024 of the 2 519 batsmen who have taken the crease in 131 years of test cricket bradman stands alone and untouched
8180025 i am no aware of any other sport which has one competitor so far above any other performer
8180026 no one has even come close to this i suspect no one else ever will
8180027 he soon became not just donald bradman but the don
8180028 in the tough years of the depression he was a hero at home and a great source of national pride in difficult times
8180029 he is our clark kent the mild mannered ordinary man who contains and conceals immeasurable powers is always there when needed and always delivers the goods but with nobility of purpose
8180030 something to watch not only a great batsman but a marvellous fieldsman too
8180031 the food bank was kind of his family he was always there
8180032 we didnt know maybe 50 this was a huge surprise
8180033 when we had our big food drives from postal carriers and at holiday time we just didnt have any extra space
8180034 we want to acquire another building and open up 25 more beds
8180035 in our whole database we found that he had given a total of 50
8180036 he must have seen a lot of families in that food bank
8180037 he wanted to make sure women and children were taken care of
8180038 creating a space for 25 more women and children to be housed and fed his gift is exponential and powerful
8180039 in his will he left his entire estate to charity he had no immediate family
8180040 no secret there are just 2 simple steps first you recruit people around the world in proportion to your business if 10 of your business is in nigeria 10 of your managers should be nigerian second you mix them up if they never leave their homes they never become international managers send them on visits expatriate assignments put them in international teams and projects so they mix with their colleagues and learn
8180041 if you do these 2 things in no more than 50 years you will have an international management group
8180042 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8180043 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8180044 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8180045 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8180046 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8180047 the project should be completed at the latest within three years beginning in june next year 2009
8180048 the turkish government has given the necessary instructions to the environment ministry so the project can be finalised
8180049 the pumping station will not have a great impact on the beach where it will be constructed either environmentally or scenically it will not be a huge construction
8180050 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
8180051 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
8180052 cutting off support that will save the lives of thousands of american troops
8180053 and look tim if you tell me ive got to take away this protection for these kids in order to win the election some things arent worth it some things are worth losing over that would be worth losing over hundreds of lives are being saved and will be saved by us sending these vehicles over which we are funding with this supplemental legislation and i want to ask any of my other colleagues would they in fact vote to cut off the money for those troops to protect them thats the right question this isnt cutting off the war this is cutting off support that will save the lives of thousands of american troops
8180054 i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
8180055 would i make a blanket commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of each of those countries within the first year i was elected president absolutely positively no
8180056 the last thing you want to do is telegraph to the folks in pakistan that were about to violate quote their sovereignty
8180057 a nd im told senator obama announced today senator lantos sic and i wrote into law the requirement that the aid to pakistan be conditioned upon their support of us going after al qaeda in their western province it already is a law the question the way to deal with it is not to announce it is to do it the last thing you want to do is telegraph to the folks in pakistan that were about to violate quote their sovereignty putting musharraf in a position that makes it virtually impossible for him to do anything other than what hes done basically cut a deal with the warlords along that border to our great detriment so its not something you talk about
8180058 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan much of what senator obama has proposed senator biden has already initiated or accomplished
8180059 biden campaign congratulates sen obama for johnny come lately position
8180060 saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the united states or to his neighbors
8180061 s addam poses no imminent and direct threat to the united states or to his neighbors that the iraqi economy is in shambles that the iraqi military a fraction of its former strength and that in concert with the international community he can be contained until in the way of all petty dictators he falls away into the dustbin of history
8180062 helped to authorize and engineer the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation
8180063 well look i find it amusing that those who helped to authorize and engineer the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation are now criticizing me for making sure that we are on the right battlefield and not the wrong battlefield in the war against terrorism
8180064 this is a guy whos used weapons of mass destruction this is a guy whos destabilized the whole neighborhood this is a guy who in a war with the iranians over 800 000 people on both sides were killed this is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world and this is a guy who is in every way possible seeking weapons of mass destruction that case in and of itself ought to be sufficient
8180065 if the president of the united states was saying four years ago clear evidence of mass destruction do we have any choice but to eliminate saddam hussein and the threat
8180066 i still believe that saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction
8180067 i still believe that saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction and that the war in iraq was justified
8180068 statement of senator joe biden on the white houses acknowledgment that iraq uranium assertion was wrong
8180069 i mean look the president had a choice and it was a tough choice when he came when 9 11 occurred he could either listen to the advice colin powell and shinseki and most of the uniformed military and john mccain as well and dick lugar and others or choose the advice of the vice president secretary of state the secretary of defense and others and he chose the wrong advice and this i think we need a fresh start to be able to gain any momentum on this war on terror and i dont think were going to see any change id feel a lot better if i knew that president bush was going to be elected and im not being solicitous if i knew he was going to start to listen to john mccain instead of the secretary of defense because they have totally different no i shouldnt say totally many have very different views of how to proceed and so i think youd see a difference in the way how you prosecute the war in iraq i think youd see a difference in how you dealt with homeland security and i think youd see a difference in terms of the cooperation with other nations in terms of getting the consensus on how to deal with controlling chemical biological nuclear weapons
8180070 and so ive believed for a long time a view shared by my republican colleague john mccain and many others as well that we need more force in iraq thats not a popular position to take but we need more force now in order to have less force later we need to gain control of security in iraq
8180071 you may end up going against a senate colleague perhaps mccain perhaps frist
8180072 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
8180073 sen joe biden of delaware a former presidential candidate and longtime senator he could help obama with perceived shortcomings on experience especially with foreign policy
8180074 what americans are looking for is not washington experience but do you have life experience that is gonna lead you to make good decisions
8180075 i do think that increasingly what americans are looking for is not washington experience but do you have life experience that is gonna lead you to make good decisions and are you in touch with whats happening on the ground
8180076 what i was drawing on in dealing with iraq was a set of experiences that come from a life of living overseas having family overseas being able to see the world through the eyes of people outside our borders
8180077 and i have to remind them when i hear this you know dick cheney and donald rumsfeld had two of the longest resumes in washington they did and led us into the worst foreign policy disaster in a generation so long resumes dont guarantee good judgment
8180078 obamas n h swing the clinton brand human rights growing up in a muslim country
8180079 the sort of general notion of experience based on longevity in washington i dont think is sufficient to make the case to the voters of iowa or the american people
8180080 you should keep on doing the same things with the same people over and over again and somehow expect a different outcome and thats the definition of madness
8180081 what washington is really telling you is that you should keep on doing the same things with the same people over and over again and somehow expect a different outcome and thats the definition of madness doing the same things over and over again and expecting something different
8180082 the idea is to maintain a unified iraq by decentralizing it and giving kurds shiites and sunnis their own regions the central government would be responsible for common interests like border security and the distribution of oil revenues it would require a regional non aggression pact overseen by the u n security council and it would allow us to responsibly withdraw most u s forces from iraq by the end of 2007
8180083 his broader proposal calls for a political solution that would provide regional autonomy for shiites sunnis and kurds and guarantees by the central government that sunnis would share in the countrys oil revenues
8180084 prince turki told a conference on washingtons relations with the arab world that dividing iraq into three regions reflecting its shiite sunni and kurdish populations would be a disaster
8180085 to envision that you can divide iraq into three parts is to envision ethnic cleansing on a massive scale sectarian killing on a massive scale and uprooting of families
8180086 many middle east experts are horrified by the difficulty of dividing the nation
8180087 you talk too much and you say things without thinking about them norman ornstein a friend and admirer told the senator as he was gearing up for his candidacy i know ive got to be more disciplined biden replied
8180088 he has a tendency to over explain that doesnt inure to his political benefit acknowledges larry rasky who will be communications director for bidens presidential campaign
8180089 a s a candidate for the 1988 democratic presidential nomination biden withdrew from the race in 1987 amid accusations that he had plagiarized passages in a campaign speech from former british labor party leader neil kinnock
8180090 kinnock told of ancestors who played football after long days underground in the mines who recited poetry and paved the way for him to become the first in his family to attend college when he saw a tape of kinnock in action biden said it was a connect i mean i could tell how that man felt thats how i feel so he used it changing the names but little else at a debate last month in iowa
8180091 bidens way with words now seems to be a liability
8180092 but instead of crediting kinnock he told the audience he thought of it on the way to the debate
8180093 bidens way with words now seems to be a liability
8180094 biden acknowledged kinnocks language didnt fit his family perfectly his father was in used car sales his grandfather was a mining engineer but he had been told and assumed that other relatives had worked in the mines and to make it clear members of his mothers family had indeed been to college
8180095 bidens way with words now seems to be a liability
8180096 now the exaggerated shadow of those mistakes has begun to obscure the essence of my candidacy and the essence of joe biden
8180097 democrat joe biden is a compelling orator but he developed a serious credibility problem after questions surfaced about plagiarism and possible falsifications of his academic record
8180098 b iden soon ran into trouble at syracuse law he was accused of plagiarism after lifting five pages from a law review article for a course paper but his pleading i implore you dont take my honor convinced the dean to let him stay in school take the course over and wipe the slate clean
8180099 bidens way with words now seems to be a liability
8180100 sen joseph r biden jr his democratic presidential campaign battered by charges of plagiarism in his campaign speeches and in a law school paper admitted yesterday that some of his boasts about his college academic achievements were untrue including the claim that he had finished in the top half of his class in law school
8180101 specializing in the sort of earmarks doled out by sen biden
8180102 university of delaware president david roselle turned to the lobbying firm of william oldaker a well connected washington insider who had served as a campaign adviser and fundraiser for sen joe biden just a year earlier bidens son hunter and oldaker co founded the law firm oldaker biden and belair in a downtown d c office just a block from lafayette park and the white house working out of the same suite as the law firm oldaker also helped launch the national group a lobbying affiliate specializing in the sort of earmarks doled out by sen biden and delawares two other members of congress sen tom carper and rep mike castle

8180105 ud gets earmarks with help of lobbyists connected to biden
8180106 with oldakers firm playing rainmaker the university of delawares earmarks climbed dramatically the university has secured another 68 million from the delaware delegation in the five years since the national groups lobbyists began working for ud
8180107 ud gets earmarks with help of lobbyists connected to biden
8180108 while ud increased its earmarks the national group expanded its portfolio in 2002 the lobbying firm signed 28 clients three years later 70 clients were paying 5 4 million for the influence of lobbyists like oldaker and hunter biden according to the center for responsive politics campaign finance tracking web site opensecrets org
8180109 ud gets earmarks with help of lobbyists connected to biden
8180110 sen bidens staffers usually get a phone call from the national group at the beginning of the appropriations cycle and one or two followup contacts later in the process according to bidens office
8180111 ud gets earmarks with help of lobbyists connected to biden
8180112 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8180113 as with his illinois state senate days the impression one gets from mr obamas brief tenure as a u s senator is that he is an unabashed liberal and one would be right
8180114 i think this is a last ditch effort to go out and rape the offshore continental shelf so that they own it and are able to use it as leverage in the future because they know if they dont get it in the last couple of months of this administration theyre not going to get it biden said
8180115 warner r va amendment no 1566 to the reid d nev substitute amendment no 1502 the warner amendment would authorize virginia to petition for the authority to conduct natural gas drilling and exploration in the states coastal zone
8180116 i see a role for nuclear but first youve got to deal with the security as well as the safety concerns id be spending a whole hell of a lot of money trying to figure out how to reconfigure the spent fuel into reusable fuel i would not invest in growing our nuclear power capacity in its current form but i would invest in sorting out the storage and waste problems
8180117 the resolution obama voted for would not have increased taxes on any single taxpayer making less than 41 500 per year in total income or any couple making less than 83 000 the 32 000 figure is approximately the taxable income of a single person making 41 500 per year after all deductions and exclusions

8180133 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile
8180134 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
8180135 i really cant pay too much attention to that kind of stuff
8180136 thats really not in my hands thats up to the coaching staff ive just got to go out there and keep competing at practice and show them im trying to get better and im still a growing player in this league
8180137 i wouldnt want to elaborate whether a player is safe from being cut or whether hes involved in discussions but certainly were evaluating all of our players for this final roster
8180138 if you werent seeing it it would be an easier decision
8180139 but youre seeing it youre seeing explosion youre seeing a guy break on the ball so thats a good thing
8180140 i am not disappointed at all with the path and the progress that these two young players have made
8180141 it takes time so if its not up to somebody elses standards i cant control that i am very happy with what i see
8180142 theyll continue to get better and thats the most important thing they need reps they need to play in games and thats why well try to get them as many opportunities as we possibly can this thursday against tennessee
8180143 i feel like ive had some pretty good days in practice some days where i felt like everything went well and everything came together and i felt really good about it
8180144 obviously the preseason games havent gone like i want them to and hopefully we can finish it off this week with a good one
8180145 its going to be tough because theyre obviously good theyve got some great players its going to be a big challenge for us but were going to have to go out there and its just going to make us execute that much better and be on point because if were not we may not have that much success
8180146 i want to get out there and prove to myself that im going to be able to play in this league
8180147 im just looking forward to it its going to be a lot of fun im going to try to take what ive done in camp so far practice and everything and translate that to the game field
8180148 i say matt hes more comfortable more laid back kind of nonchalant about everything brians the same way off the field but once he gets on the field hes kind of like he presses a little bit youve just got to let the game come to you and do what youve been doing to get to this point i think that if they do that theyll be fine
8180149 i think this game is going to give them a lot of opportunities to showcase what they have
8180150 were looking forward to it were excited for both of them because we know they both have a bright upside
8180151 thats why they formed this team because its not based off of one player so were extremely confident in whoevers out there on the field
8180152 you wouldnt believe it and thats what it is now
8180153 but its a good situation they did a good job of organizing the new stadium for us for students transportation will be easy because well have buses to take them up there therell be a student parking lot also so everything we want as far as getting the students there will be better than what we had before
8180154 we really didnt want to move in the end we had to
8180155 we have a wonderful opportunity and future ahead of us we want to do the best for our players and for our fans so were taking a giant step
8180156 i assumed i was going to be redshirted so thats why i wanted to play defense to have fun
8180157 i didnt know i would pick it up that well playing on the defensive side of the ball but it worked out well
8180158 im grateful for it its going to help me out later on in my career
8180159 i tried to tell him we really needed a fullback and we had a lot of defensive ends
8180160 he said i dont care i want to play defensive end in two weeks he was a starter at defensive end and hes been a starter for four straight years
8180161 he was asking to go over to the offense on goal line situations
8180162 he gets better every year hes gotten better bigger stronger faster
8180163 hes a tough opponent when the time comes hes definitely going to be able to perform hes going to cause a lot of havoc out there
8180164 hes just a laid back guy hes cool easy to get along with
8180165 i like to hang with him sometimes when i get a chance hes a good guy

8180201 customers with hundreds of trailers in their yards found that even with previous generation yard management systems and rf technology tracking and locating individual trailers for yard movements and audits was challenging especially when you consider the impact of the weather elements those without system support were even worse off but the ability of rfid technology to read all of the tags in a given area makes finding trailers and verifying movements a natural by product of proximity to fixed or mobile readers this makes yard management more accurate and efficient

8180275 the filipino people deserve more meaningful and relevant actions from the office of the ombudsman beyond press conferences and useless pageantry beyond pretentious numbers and ambitious posturing

8180315 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8180316 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8180317 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8180318 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8180319 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8180320 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8180321 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8180322 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8180323 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8180324 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8180325 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8180326 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8180327 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8180328 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play

8180351 dalam peraturan memang tak boleh ada iklan yang menunjukkan display atau batang rokok tetapi perusahaan rokok ini pinter dan pembuat iklan yang dibayar mahal itu juga pinter mereka berupaya bagaimana caranya agar masuk dalam persepsi masyarakat bahwa its oke untuk merokok jadi kemudian digunakanlah hal hal positif dan saya kira ini sangat berpengaruh besar
8180352 dalam suatu iklan rokok misalnya digambarkan bagaimana seseorang yang rame rame dengan temannya lalu ada pula yang kesusahan dibantu oleh teman teman lain kesannya merokok seakan akan dapat mengakrabkan dengan merokok seakan akan ada norma norma positif yang terbentuk
8180353 ketika seseorang telah melihat iklan maka ia diyakini telah memasukkan iklan itu sebagai informasi tambahan dalam ingatannya di masa mendatang ia berpotensi besar untuk bertindak dan mengambil keputusan atas dasar informasi tersebut

8180364 there are now so many almost daily occasions when we have to stand up and verify our identity
8180365 we also love the amenities package that brooks shorey destin florida throws in dolphin cruise round of golf movie rentals fishing for the kids and always make use of it and they throw in 2 beach chairs and an umbrella each day as well my husband and i are celebrating our 10th anniversary this summer and wed planned this grandiose trip to paris but we decided wed rather save our money and spend a week relaxing at the beach guess where were staying
8180366 i have three kids and the program made our vacation possible
8180367 my family has just returned from a week long vacation at the blue surf destin florida it was our first true family vacation with our two young children ages 2 and 3 the blue surf exceeded our expectations and provided the perfect environment for our young family as a side note the management company we used newman dailey provided a family fun pack with discounts and tickets including a free round of golf for each day free movie rentals tickets to the local amusement park and tickets for a dolphin cruise with a young family and a husband that golfs this was a huge bonus i think ive more than conveyed our satisfaction with the blue surf we are already looking forward to returning in the future
8180368 were very happy to get a five time brazilian jiu jitsu world champion in our organization
8180369 its going to solidify our 145 pound weight division bibiano is a true sportsman hes crowd entertaining and he carries himself very well so were proud to have him with us he is already recognized in the jiu jitsu community and now hes going to make a name for himself in mixed martial arts
8180370 if you look at the guys he has fought these are pretty big steps to start your mma career
8180371 give him time on the world scene and hes going to become a top mma fighter
8180372 he was a very tough guy he was very good
8180373 he trained a lot for the fight i tried but sometimes you cant submit the guy thats when you go to punching and kicking to win i like to fight if you punch me im going to punch you back two times this is my style i go with the flow of the fight if he gives me the armlock ill take it if he gives me the mount ill take it if he gives me a choke ill take it ill take whatever my opponent gives me
8180374 it gives good opportunities to fighters like myself and i love calgary the people are very friendly
8180375 whoever fights me now it doesnt matter because ive already fought the best my dream was to fight in mma now ive done that and im waiting for the belt to come

8180382 we have taken babies and children out of car seats kids out of seat belts dead because somebody didnt belt themselves in
8180383 in between the slope of certain seats and seat belts just the way they are made are they flexible are they on a rigid attachment you need to find a car seat that fits in your car
8180384 the five point harness system takes the force of a crash and spreads it evenly across the strongest point of the childs body and does it better than the three point system does
8180385 putting your weight into the car seat is what makes the difference as you are pushing it down into the seat of the car and it tightens it up
8180386 you cant take a child and put him in twisted straps and expect it to evenly distribute the weight during a crash the force of the crash you cant do it when it is twisted like that

8180394 obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8180395 i havent spent the last 35 years in the trenches to see another republican in the white house
8180396 i ask all of you who worked so hard for me and who contributed so much to work as hard for barack obama in the next few months
8180397 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8180398 we need barack obama and joe biden in the white house
8180399 proud supporter of barack obama ms clinton dismissed republican john mccain with a few choice words
8180400 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8180401 i know a little bit about how the white house works and with michelle obama we are going to have someone who can answer that phone
8180402 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8180403 walk on their own defend their own sovereignty and borders have the ability to repel the threats of the taliban that continue to plague this country and have the ability to work interoperably with nato forces which again will figure prominently in the training
8180404 all of this leads to the ability for afghanistan to establish that necessary security so we can get on with the important humanitarian and reconstruction work that will lead to a more prosperous and safe country
8180405 there is no question that this has been a tough season very difficult sledding for our forces as well as our allies
8180406 we are quite together confident that we are engaged in a just cause in a noble endeavour against an evil that is threatening the whole human civilization and nobody will be safe against these threats no matter what part of the planet they are situated
8180407 it is also our intention that we should not be a burden on our canadian friends and allies or the rest of the international community forever so with their help i think we will stand on our own feet and i think we will take on our physical security ourselves and gradually allow the reduction of the reduction of the forces of our friends and allies

8180422 the perfect solution is to just win a game here with those guys that would be great
8180423 i definitely get a lot of grief from my buddies most of them are oilers fans
8180424 when i signed here with calgary i had a few phone calls from good buddies up in northern alberta and they always grew up as oilers fans at the same time theyre still really behind me no matter where i play im still playing home here in alberta and thats a bonus for sure
8180425 i dont know i might convince a few but its probably going to be tough theyll still be cheering for us but when were playing against edmonton a few of my buddies might be on the other side thats fine well sort that out after the game
8180426 its mostly oilers fans up there but well see if we can get a few more red jerseys on up there when i was back home this summer i ran into a couple of kids who were big calgary fans now well have to get more guys

8180526 its clear for any unprejudiced person it was georgian side that started using force after many years of relative peace

8180634 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8180635 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8180636 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8180637 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8180638 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8180639 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8180640 all you need is 200 people in the crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8180641 jesse did a fantastic job and we had every opportunity to win the game with his leadership every time we would get inside the 20 yard line we would shoot ourselves in the foot
8180642 that was a last minute entry right there but it is one of those recruiting stories
8180643 virginia tech had over signed on some scholarships and couldnt take him we have a pretty good relationship with hokies head coach frank beamer we were able to talk to him and they released pressley to us
8180644 realistically if we can have him learn enough of the offense by then and we could use him in the conference games that would be outstanding
8180645 he gets some place to play right now as opposed to having to wait until january and we get a good player and virginia tech was first class enough to let him go instead of trying to browbeat him and hold him to a gray shirt year
8180646 weve had retired union members from uaw come out and walk the line with us
8180647 we put a good service out there and were continuing to do that the whole team of parta folks doing a good job
8180648 i dont think we are seeing that at this time and did not see improvements in 07
8180649 we are not seeing that the poverty level is going down were seeing more and more people in need of help
8180650 it just takes one thing to blow a persons budget for a month were seeing more of the working poor who do have a job but with rising costs just cant make ends meet
8180651 we are blessed to have a player like nathan he is the reason we are where we are
8180652 i have been putting better and chipping the ball well

8180655 ironic in the strict sense of the word mr davis makes photographs in his home state of california but shoots at night in marginal semi industrial areas creating images that are the opposite of sunny nevertheless there is a conventional beauty about his pictures that keeps them from being too deeply unsettling
8180656 working at night with a homemade large format view camera a bigger version of the boxy equipment that pioneering american photographers trundled through yosemite and the grand canyon davis records not scenic vistas but the empty lots and anonymous structures that dot the contemporary california landscape davis gives it a noir twist and serves it up in rich platinum prints that render even the deadest of dead ends a broad sandy highway shoulder crisscrossed with tire tracks weirdly seductive
8180657 davis has a sharp eye for inanimate drama and his black and white prints have a rich physicality in one shot raking headlights illuminate a sandy roadside giving crisscrossed tire tracks the hefty presence of fossils these lonely parked cars forlorn streetlights and darkened billboards capture a mundane noir the shadowy flip side of sunny paradise

8180718 i dont think lowering the drinking age is the appropriate response to address the binge drinking among youth
8180719 an 18 year old is allowed to vote get married enlist in the military and enroll in college because society accepts her or his ability to make decisions as an adult
8180720 if 18 year olds are old enough to serve our country they should be free to choose whether to have a beer or a glass of wine
8180721 if you bring it out into the open you can regulate it
8180722 its very difficult to say to the students we want you to drink responsibly but we are not going to let you do it until you are 21

8180727 earned for years of hard but ultimately successful efforts on behalf of texland that also benefited pec
8180728 following this payment we never received another payment from this account or from texland
8180729 this revelation is a continuing pattern of how fuelberg and burnett lined their own pockets by fleecing the pec membership
8180730 once the texland bank account was made known to the members fuelberg and burnett knew it was only a matter of time before this information was uncovered i want to know what else they are hiding from the members
8180731 i was not aware that texland was an active entity and certainly not aware there was a non interest bearing bank account in texlands name to find out payments were actually made from this account without board knowledge and approval is extremely disheartening
8180732 we will continue researching our own records and working with the lower colorado river authority and bluebonnet electric cooperative to inform our members and the public about all the confirmed details of this situation
8180733 at this juncture we have found no record of our board being informed of these payments prior to now and sitting members who were on the board at that time do not recall approving them
8180734 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8180735 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8180736 vision is that if you come play the lpga and can win a tournament then you ought to be able to give your acceptance speech in english and i totally agree
8180737 our fans want to relate and connect with the players and how better to relate than through conversation
8180738 if we were employed in any other business in another country theyd definitely want you to learn that nations language
8180739 its good for dealing with corporate sponsors and entertaining them
8180740 i dont think the ruling is necessarily a bad thing
8180741 the lpga gives them every opportunity to learn english we get free use of rosetta stone language software and other tools for it
8180742 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8180743 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8180744 lpga is seeking to make english par for the course
8180745 the decision will require us to make some extremely difficult decisions

8180747 what we didnt need to do was raise the white flag in a memo to every cps worker to simply protect cps rather than protect children
8180748 although the changes which are necessary are substantial and call for a rapid transition this in no way lessens our commitment to do what is in the best interest of each individual child in each individual circumstance
8180749 the whole reason we started the litigation was because we felt there were wrongs in the system

8180796 i know its difficult to implement in the middle of a season but the games are important in september i hope it works well
8180797 we play all year long and were trying to get somewhere and all we need is for somebody to miss a call like that

8180801 we spend a lot time working with our designers on the homepage
8180802 and once the home page is solid we use it as a template to create other pages on the website consistency and easy of use are absolutely paramount especially in our economic environmental development industry
8180803 and the old adage you have to spend money to make money applies dont go cheap on your websites checkout process or navigational menus instead save money by using simple content generation software and ready made blog software these steps will ensure quality at the right price
8180804 dont forget that economic environmental development affiliate programs are a great way to drive customers towards your site
8180805 you may have to pay up to 25 for an affiliate lead but in the long run youre making a hell of a lot more money than you would without affiliate traffic youll find that the top 20 of your affiliates count for nearly 80 of all your income so be sure to take care of your business partners

8180809 and some times a little luck and good old fashioned word of mouth advertising
8180810 fancy drop down menus and fast moving flash graphics are great for catching the users eye but when you want to get down to business make sure your site presents an easy navigation menu and map this will allow most economic environmental development users to get what they are after and at the same time be wowed by your graphical presentations

8180814 i saw him throw his finger toward the showers and i thought what are you talking about
8180815 youre going to throw me out and the games already over youre cool
8180816 somebody to get close enough to where i could touch them
8180817 there are a lot of reasons for it but ill talk about it at the end of the season
8180818 i joked around with coach that i really dont like to run the ball but in this offense im trying to adapt things pop open so i guess im kind of enjoying becoming a runner although i get yelled at every once in a while when i pitch the ball to the running back
8180819 ive seen no swelling in his knee he hasnt been hit yet but hes looked real good
8180820 i feel like i should be ready for anything else
8180821 we kind of like to work the field all over
8180822 i sat out spring ball and got to watch and get the feel of things from the sidelines
8180823 so im pretty excited about this season and the team that we have we have a really good defense that is going to carry us through a couple of games our offense will start coming along and with our defenses help well be in a position to win a lot of games
8180824 this is just one of those injuries that you have to take your time with
8180825 if you dont take your time with it youll have it the whole year
8180826 youve got greg youve got hank and we even worked jason avant in there a little bit this past game
8180827 i dont want to go out there and not be full speed
8180828 if im not full speed ill do what i have to do its strong and feeling good but its got a little ways to go
8180829 its kind of frustrating trying to pick up a position this late in the preseason
8180830 its like all right youve been doing this for a year and a half but now were going to try something different you have to start all over and get on the same page as guys who have been in there doing it so you know it is a little frustrating
8180831 he has to continue to take a step forward i need to see him be better than he was last week
8180832 im not going to say he was poor last week but i want to see improvement he is on his second week here so there should be marked improvement there
8180833 ive only been doing this for a week and a half it would be like me asking you how long it would take you to go be an astronaut
8180834 it was a lot similar to those games last year very much so
8180835 i think any time somebody pops off i think it catches some fire to it between the media and the fans and our players
8180836 i think our players hear that and they kind of take that to heart they get up and they get more determined and everything thats kind of like fighting words it kind of sets them off
8180837 if you notice we seem like we are in a more business frame of mind so that means we dont particularly want to associate with them i like that ive always liked that i think when we come to the ballpark when i put my uniform on were going to come out here and beat you i dont have any friends on the field when were playing weve got a couple guys like that and i really love that part about them
8180838 rodriguez said last month at the big ten media days in chicago
8180839 i mean what did i do i changed jobs thats all i did
8180840 after a while it was just stand in line and throw some more darts my way
8180841 im just anxious to coach football and let people judge me on that
8180842 i dont want to put a time frame to it other than sooner rather than later
8180843 but i will say this we want our guys to have a sense of urgency to be successful right away
8180844 our goal every year is to compete for a big ten championship i dont want to say ok well be able to do that in 2009 or 2010 we want to do that this year
8180845 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8180846 i liked the handle usually bats like that break easy this felt pretty durable
8180847 i clearly had the advantage because he couldnt walk me and he really couldnt risk it and throw me a slider
8180848 so i pretty much knew i was going to get fastballs to hit it certainly wasnt an easy situation but it was as easy a situation as a batter could be in as long as you recognize that and know that hes got to come with a fastball ultimately he did
8180849 you forget that you get paid to play the game it was almost like we felt like little kids
8180850 but i have my own system i get some hot tea and cold water
8180851 if you get a little tired you splash some on your face
8180852 you always have the challenge as a coach to make sure they dont get bored
8180853 a lot of times ill put new packages in just because of that but sometimes you have to give them a break during the meetings
8180854 yeah weve seen a few guys go to sleep especially the rookies
8180855 a lot of times rookies myself included think well be done by noon and have the rest of the day to hang out but its like a regular day at work youll see a coach call out a guy when hes sleeping hey you see this you see this guy and theyre still knocked out
8180856 i try to bring a little juice and creativity to the presentation
8180857 we dont have many problems at all except sometimes with a veteran who has heard that particular play for the 300th time
8180858 hell tell us to stand up but he pretty much understands he knows the meetings get long and its hard to stay awake hell joke about it sometimes
8180859 a lot of it is on his shoulders for wednesday on how the offense goes
8180860 i have the same mind set as the coaches going into the wednesday morning meeting
8180861 as were in the meeting ill highlight different things i think we should emphasize the main purpose of the meeting is for the offensive line and running backs to find out what running plays we want to attack them with and for the receivers to find out what depth they should run their routes and how the defense may play them im looking at how the cornerbacks play and trying to figure out their weaknesses and strengths
8180862 i usually go through the personnel of the opponent coming up and some of the key things we have to stop
8180863 then we talk about the game plan and i show them a little bit of film of the opponent its definitely one of the most important days
8180864 we have 16 to 20 plays in the walk through
8180865 those are all the new plays shifts formations and motions anything that is new
8180866 if your quarterback doesnt feel good about it you get rid of the play
8180867 you get 150 plays in your game plan and youre going to run 60 of those if our quarterback doesnt feel good about it its gone
8180868 they do a good job of reminding us of that
8180869 there have been times when we had a big win and we come back on wednesday and were looking like crap theyll let us know we might go with pads the next day just to send us a message
8180870 sometimes you have to have patience at the wednesday practice knowing that you put something new in and it might take them a day to learn it
8180871 by friday i want to make sure we have eliminated those mistakes were always putting a new pressure package in every week
8180872 thats the time for the position coaches to get with their players watch some film and get an idea of the guy theyre going against those meetings usually last about an hour
8180873 after the position meetings we come up and look at practice on film and then we start getting ready for the next days practice
8180874 usually im able to leave around 9 30 or 10 oclock a lot of times its a 16 hour day because you just want to make sure you cover everything
8180875 i dont want to fight i dont want to shout
8180876 i wish i could play normal matches and enjoy tennis
8180877 people are just going to have to get people out
8180878 you define your own role i dont define them well just have to keep doing it until we figure it out and we will
8180879 a lot of times we like to blame one group or another but this was a team effort
8180880 we didnt hold them and we didnt add on weve had some tough losses this year but the sun will come up tomorrow and well play again
8180881 its frustrating to lose when youre ahead by that much
8180882 but in this team with this stadium its not enough this bandbox here is a good place for them to play
8180883 it can do nothing or it can do a lot well find out the next couple games obviously thats not the way you want the game to end after you have a 7 0 lead but well see what were made of
8180884 this is not the first time weve seen this and not just in philadelphia
8180885 it happens all over the place you have to keep playing hard right through the 27th out

8180892 we probably should try to stay away from him tomorrow
8180893 were having trouble scoring runs and everybody probably goes up there squeezing the sawdust out of the bats
8180894 i dont think theres any magic formula other than keep going out there and fighting the frustration we seem to be experiencing
8180895 id rather have that any night than no balls hit to me it makes it fun they can hit to me every time thats what i think thats what youve got to think i take a lot of pride in my defense
8180896 we were not aware that jones was in the bay area
8180897 i love the game and im glad weve got him because i wouldnt want him on any other team i know hes going to give us a great opportunity to win games hes a special athlete and a great athlete
8180898 i cant rush back if i rush it that might be my whole season dealing with the hamstring injury week in and week out i dont want that
8180899 its getting better every day so i think if it continues to progress like it is now i should be ready for the first game
8180900 its not good that it happened but luckily it happened in the preseason where i have an opportunity to rehab and get strong and not feel like i have to play on a bum leg
8180901 the inside receiver is against a lot of safeties and the linebackers who come down here and try to guard you to me that is a mismatch im a lot faster just get the ball in my hands and i can make things happen i know theyre going to try to get in my face and jam me on the line of scrimmage ive been working real hard on that
8180902 hopefully when i come back theyll still want to give me the ball
8180903 the season hasnt started yet its still preseason and preseason is preseason it really doesnt count for anything
8180904 had a good spring practice and a really good preseason
8180905 so were going to go with clark and start him but i dont want him looking over his shoulder
8180906 theres a psychological element that goes into playing quarterback joes not saying ive tattooed this position on your back but a quarterback has to know that hes going to have some ups and downs and still have our confidence
8180907 i told clark and ill tell him again before he goes on the field and when we meet on friday hey just go in there and enjoy it
8180908 clark smiles i said to the other two kids you guys ok with that yeah lets go win that was it
8180909 pats a competitor and im sure hes looking at it that its not done yet
8180910 both of them can run the same offense but their strengths are different
8180911 pats been the guy more comfortable in the pocket and darylls more of a get him out of the pocket and let him make plays guy
8180912 i know people are going to say we picked daryll because hes the older guy
8180913 number one if we did that we would have picked paul a graduate student so that debunks that and number two thats not being fair to daryll
8180914 if i had to tilt one way or the other like an airplane id tilt that way
8180915 it would be safe to say that im leaning toward that
8180916 the most important thing to me is us getting ready as a group and getting ready for miami
8180917 the more work he does with our guys in the group the better
8180918 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8180919 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8180920 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8180921 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8180922 i think our organization was in favor of it i think its important to get those calls right
8180923 well go along with it im in favor of getting things right if it takes replay then i guess im for replay
8180924 what people dont understand is how it affects you sometimes
8180925 that definitely played a role in that game and then 2 nights later when the phillies lost again after a long rain delay that kind of buried us
8180926 at the same time weve had some go our way
8180927 its all about getting the call right i think thats what everybody wants
8180928 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8180929 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8180930 my opposition to unlimited replay is still very much in play
8180931 i really think the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8180932 i would limit this to in my personal view home runs fair or foul
8180933 i would not go beyond that i think its important to continue to have that human element of people making decisions on the field i think umpires should continue to be an important part of the game
8180934 thats what i want really my birthday present is to win today
8180935 i dont want to get too amped because then i leave the ball up if i get too hyper and thats not me
8180936 just kind of relax a little bit and narrow my focus all that is going to happen once you get on the mound once the game starts its fine
8180937 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8180938 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8180939 within the world of basketball within those trail blazers teams he was a jokester
8180940 he was a big loving teddy bear at times guys got frustrated because he didnt have a mean streak
8180941 weve had our couple of injuries here too thats all part of the game
8180942 we just have to get him healthy and get him out there
8180943 ive had a chance to look at him on film
8180944 i think hes playing well it doesnt look like he is any different than he was last year he is making great throws
8180945 college prepares you for the real world thats what my guidance counselors told me anyway
8180946 i thought a bachelor of arts degree was going to guarantee me a job with great benefits and a pension after i graduated from college in 1994 wrong
8180947 i decided to wrap every sandwich i prepared with my resume and include it with the order i sent out about 75 resumes that way over three days much to my surprise i got customer reactions some nice and some not so nice
8180948 i was aiming for any entry level job but all the calls i got were for sales and marketing positions the resume itself was pretty standard but i guess the delivery method was extraordinary and convinced employers that i knew something about marketing
8180949 a week before my start date a human resources manager called to say their company could not hire me because of budget cuts now i had to beg for my old job back again
8180950 she had a new job lead for me it was for a sales position at a company run by her husband
8180951 its a great way to win we pulled it out tonight
8180952 you forget that youre getting paid to play the game we almost felt like little kids with the excitement and kind of a playoff atmosphere
8180953 i havent made any decisions yet on what direction im going to go as far as playing time
8180954 we will just wait until we get to the game day and i will determine how long i want everybody to go
8180955 those things happen and thats all part of the game
8180956 ive played in a lot of games and i hope that works to my advantage
8180957 i feel like ive gotten better on defense but special teams is where im going to make an impact
8180958 i feel comfortable with my assignments ultimately its up to the coaches but i have no regrets on how ive worked and the progress ive made
8180959 do i want him to have more reps yes i would love to have him in there
8180960 but thats the way it is he has to catch up when he can
8180961 i wasnt sure clark was a good enough football player
8180962 but he was a good kid i thought maybe someday hed be a linebacker something like that i wasnt sure at all hed ever play quarterback for us
8180963 he was at kiski a week and he called me and said jay theres no girls here
8180964 we look at hundreds and hundreds of tapes and sometimes we cant figure out if we like someone or dont like him
8180965 and im talking about guys who have coached great players but i gotta say daryll clark surprised me
8180966 i just think that clark is a little bit ahead of the other two hes had a little bit more experience hes done everything weve asked of him i felt he was the best choice for our football team
8180967 jay was trying to get me to play clark more in 2007
8180968 i just didnt think it was right for morelli morelli was getting all kinds of hell from everybody and i didnt think it was fair i had a little loyalty to morelli
8180969 its sad because ive been a quarterback since i was 6 years old so i know what i can do
8180970 where you find out about somebody is when the games on the line 2 minutes to go youve got to drive the ball down the field to win it
8180971 our quarterbacks havent been in that situation yet itll be interesting to see how they react to it
8180972 i also want to be the guy whos there at the end when it counts
8180973 weve chatted with him but we thought it was most appropriate to kind of wait until the end of the season to move forward on anything
8180974 but he has expressed that he is pitching next year and beyond probably
8180975 but wed be crazy not to think that hed be able to help us next year but again that doesnt mean hes going to be back
8180976 superstitions there are stup erstitions stupid stuff you do that you think works that stuff doesnt work wear the same underwear make sure one is marked game and the other is marked bp make sure the socks are the same way all that stuff its crazy there are only 24 hours in a day
8180977 whenever you privatize something you lose some control especially controlling the sewer rates

8181012 nag show kami para sa ilang filipino communities doon yung producer namin ang bait bait sobra lahat yata ng gusto namin ibinigay niya kaya naman kami super ang pagbigay ng show as in ibang level na talaga

8181020 but at the same time thats a roster spot and guys have to go out there and go to war
8181021 i woke up this morning and wasnt as sore as i thought i would be
8181022 ill get some treatment and see how i feel tomorrow but as of right now i feel pretty good with me being able to go out and practice i figure that the ankle will get stronger it will get used to me running and jumping and cutting and things like that
8181023 i did some pretty good things but i didnt play as well as i wanted to all the time i figure that with me being able to go out and practice on a more consistent basis i wont have those peaks and valleys
8181024 i feel that im close i figure that with me being healthy as i am i can go out and practice day to day and be accountable and be dependable

8181032 the old days of online gaming economy warehousing and distribution woes are over
8181033 with the net we send everything from our central import point and save thousands weekly
8181034 ive seen companies with nearly everything perfect budget great it good distribution but a terrible working dynamic between the employees though the online gaming economy product makes it to store shelves the people working within the company feel miserable unappreciated and unmotivated
8181035 starting up any online gaming economy business is difficult in our case it took about 6 months of planning a year of fund raising and then another 6 months of building infrastructure before we made our first sale
8181036 i find that attending industry related social functions conferences and even my neighbors cocktail parties help me find new ways of growing my company
8181037 by asking the right people the right questions youll find that you can learn new things and different strategies for your online gaming economy firm that you may not have thought of before
8181038 many online gaming economy companies go pel mel spending money when there is a good cash flow while there is nothing wrong with wanting to expand it has to be done in accordance with accounting standards and detailed record keeping this is especially true for public companies private online gaming economy firms can sometimes let this aspect of the business slide alittle
8181039 in the case of our online gaming economy marketing venture we initially started out with a simple website and then slowly grew as sales increased
8181040 then the website expanded into a data warehouse essentially a store of all things related to our marketing campaigns which allowed us to study and refine subsequent efforts

8181084 the main goal of my work is to understand the brain mechanisms that underlie typical healthy social development but i still hope that once we better understand healthy development that we can use this knowledge to look into what might go awry in neurodevelopmental disorders
8181085 we are not claiming it could diagnose autism merely that it may prove a useful early warning signal
8181086 what we did not know before is which brain systems young infants use to process face to face communication and whether these brain systems and processes are similar to those employed by adults i e whether they specialise early in development

8181175 das wird ein ganz hartes spiel aber wir haben vertrauen in unsere f higkeiten
8181176 konzentration ist der entscheidende faktor wir m ssen unsere fehlerquote minimieren
8181177 die champions league ist f r uns eine gro e herausforderung

8181180 what else can i do i am not a pimp a coward to let these men get away with what they did i will sell all of my children if that is what it takes to get justice
8181181 i think that a similar effort to the police effort needs to be launched on a similar scope and scale to address the justice issues we have some real problems with corruption in the prisons here there are 10 links between arrest and putting someone in jail the police own the first four links in the process but if you fix the first four links without addressing the next six it wont work
8181182 if the taliban were still here that rapist would have already been executed by now it would have been a lesson for all

8181191 dat waren de redenen dat ik in de race was voor hetpresidentschap dat zijn de redenen dat ik nu barack obama steun en dat zijn de redenen dat jullie dat ook moeten doen
8181192 deze inschatting heeft zij op geen enkele manier gewijzigd miljoenen amerikanen blijven bezorgd over de vraag of barack obama klaar is om president te zijn

8181200 there are still a few things i need to make sure i freshen up on but i think playing wise im right where i want to be
8181201 physically missing those days kind of set me back a little bit but thats what happens when you have injuries
8181202 in todays nfl you want to make sure that you have a deep backfield
8181203 i think the thing about us is that we all bring something different to the table which gives the defense a different look
8181204 we have talked about a number of different things and a number of different options on this both with players and what is the most effective way for us to use it
8181205 the bottom line is the benefits have to outweigh the operation that is added into the whole defensive communication if it does then great and if it doesnt then it is really not worth it
8181206 i think there are some things to work through from deans standpoint from our standpoint
8181207 we really just havent had a lot of time to work on it so im sure well work again with it thursday
8181208 i thank the organization for giving me this award and i thank my teammates for supporting the work that we do with the military

8181210 but the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial which of course is kind of the point

8181225 were giving the fans ownership in how they help vote so when the guys come here theyre going to really feel special as the guys come in as the new guys come in ill be able to go and shake their hand and tell them welcome home
8181226 thats the whole experience that we want guys that are inducted into the patriots hall of fame to have that i feel like im back home now im in my spot this is where ive played and had a great career and were going to pay homage to that
8181227 all of us are going to have the re induction which is going to be very special but the goal is to give the players a little bit of what they do in canton and a little bit of a special taste of what they do from a new england standpoint i think were going to have it covered pretty well
8181228 were putting together an education curriculum and building lesson plans to get schools to come in on field trips
8181229 i used to get teammates friends people that i played against would call me and be like why are you here
8181230 thats not how i was raised from a family standpoint and from a football player standpoint you play play hard with what you have and who youre with and thats all i can do
8181231 but to see everything that is happening now and look back 26 years later its awesome it just goes to show that if you do the right things and you take care of business the right way then there is always an opportunity for you regardless of what it is

8181254 im pretty sure cloughie wouldnt like whats going on in the game now with fitness coaches taking over prozones weights dieticians pasta and bananas but he would be a success because he was a football genius
8181255 cloughie would have survived hed have adapted and made his mark at whatever club he was at because he knew his football the stuff he used to come up with at forest was so simple and i try to take that into what we do here
8181256 before i made my debut i ended up at his house in derby on the way to anfield
8181257 he gave me a pint of milk i said i dont like milk he said youd better drink it because im putting the bottles out trust me i drank it
8181258 the day after the game he asked me my name gave me a pair of his shoes and told me to polish them if i brought my shoes in for one of the players to polish im sure theyd throw them back at me but modern day players would put up with him if he was still around theyd love playing for him because he was different
8181259 once he made the whole forest first team squash into a five a side goal for no reason but it was brilliant just like a big game of twister

8181308 the upshot of less traffic is a drop in congestion levels meaning motorists can get from a to b quicker while travelling at lower and more economical speeds

8181312 what are symptoms of females that i can know about her satisfaction
8181313 can you get pregnant while you have a yeast infection
8181314 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8181315 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8181316 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8181317 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8181318 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8181319 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8181320 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8181321 but they are not effective against global warming and in order to ensure the long term survival of this rich marine community that is what we need to address
8181322 there are informations that tell us that 20 women aged between 15 to 20 years had departed for the forests in chechnya the exodus is going on we have obtained the data of the people who are leaving for the forest they are the people from saudi arabia belonging to a jamaah which are fighting for chechnya we know who are giving them foods if a while ago their strength was weakening so this year they are gaining a lot more followers the number of battles will be increasing
8181323 the jamaah have been active in daghestan and inghusetia the battles between us and the wahabis will increase the caucassus is an easy place for attacks in russia many want to blow it up in order to weaken russia
8181324 the economic health of galveston is pretty sturdy but we have a sense that people are more pinched by the cost of food and fuel
8181325 we want people to recognize what it has done in the past to touch the community
8181326 were convinced people will see these good things happening around them and be willing to come back this year to support the campaign
8181327 this may be a unique path toward potential drug development
8181328 if we are able to understand the genetic cues involved in rapid python heart muscle increases and decreases that to me says there is the potential to develop therapeutics for humans
8181329 pythons can eat up to 100 percent of their body weight at one sitting so they have to be able to respond metabolically in a dramatic way
8181330 we think several of the striking changes we see in python physiology may have significant potential for the pharmaceutical industry
8181331 there are some striking examples of extreme adaptations by animals in the wild and i think its a good idea from a biomedical standpoint to take a closer look at them
8181332 obvious customers for medical tourism are the uninsured who have to pay the entire cost of their care
8181333 g ood foreign facilities offer many common treatments at 15 of the u s price
8181334 the attraction is obvious and not just to patients without coverage
8181335 some u s employers who cover their workers now pay for treatments abroad
8181336 this is nothing less than the globalization of medical care
8181337 economists used to say that health care was the one thing that couldnt be outsourced
8181338 it means they had better get cracking on supporting a national health care system that insures everyone and controls costs
8181339 c learly they no longer have a monopoly hold on the u s consumer
8181340 the medical interests are already lobbying their elected officials to make it harder for americans to seek medical care in other lands for the good of patient safety of course
8181341 weve already seen the drugmakers try to stop americans from getting cheaper prescriptions from canada and mexico this doesnt work when the price differentials are enormous
8181342 the wiser path is to offer american consumers a better deal and let the cost of travel give domestic providers a competitive advantage
8181343 most patients would rather have medical treatment close to home anyway
8181344 particularly intriguing are the unusual categories of vocalizations and the more frequent loud harmonics evident in the btbr t tf j btbr mouse model of autism that may resemble the atypical vocalizations seen in some autistic infants
8181345 we hypothesize that ultrasonic vocalizations may be a measure of social communication in mice delayed reduced or unusual ultrasonic vocalizations in mice could offer a useful assay with reasonable face validity to the second diagnostic symptom of autism impaired communication
8181346 indicates that early palauans were of normal size and that their physical characteristics are well within the variation seen in modern human populations
8181347 if a group of small bodied humans was to evolve in an island environment it would likely require the population to be isolated for tens of thousands of years which was not the case in palau
8181348 a religious objection to any health service no matter how central to the job or health of the woman
8181349 aware that certain medical specialty groups were adopting requirements which potentially violate a physicians right to choose whether he or she performs an abortion
8181350 if hhs issues a regulation on this matter it will aim at one thing protecting the right of conscience of those who practice medicine
8181351 if that took place there wouldnt be anything you could do about it
8181352 makes it clear that its goal is to undermine state laws such as those requiring pharmacists and pharmacies to dispense emergency contraception to rape survivors and health insurance plans to cover contraception
8181353 is very supportive of secretary leavitt and the need for the new regulation
8181354 our members think the laws on the books are not comprehensive and not consistent from state to state
8181355 is unnecessary and misses a critical element respect for abortion rights
8181356 broad wording in the rule changes can be interpreted to extend to oral contraceptives and emergency contraception
8181357 s uch a broad interpretation would jeopardize funding for medicaid and title x
8181358 proposed changes must include explicit assurances they will not be used to block access to birth control and family planning
8181359 o therwise there is no choice but to see the rules as an attack on womens reproductive health rights
8181360 last year was when we found out about the epas plan to consolidate toxic waste very close to longbrook park
8181361 we already told the epa what we dont want and thats a toxic waste dump in a residential neighborhood

8181366 worldwide avian flu control efforts have been mostly successful but like seasonal influenza avian flu changes year to year creating new subtypes and strains that could easily and quickly spread among humans
8181367 vlps may be advantageous over other vaccine strategies because they are easy to develop produce and manufacture
8181368 using recombinant technologies within ten weeks we could generate a vaccine most effective towards the current circulating strain of virus making it a cost effective counter measure to the threat of an avian influenza pandemic
8181369 turning the house upside down adding weight to it and shaking it
8181370 if there is a real commitment to protect all children then supporting families and children before they reach the point of being abused and neglected should be a priority
8181371 we already know many of the risk factors for child abuse and neglect and in many cases we could identify many children who are most vulnerable before theyre even born
8181372 the current approach does little to prevent abuse but focuses on intervening once much of the harm has already been done an approach that in my view is both unethical and inhumane
8181373 while urgent action is needed to protect children being abused and neglected we need to broaden adult focussed services such as alcohol and drug treatment mental health corrections homelessness family violence etc so that they can enhance the parenting of their clients
8181374 we also need to use health promotion campaigns with messages such as alcohol and children dont mix given that one in eight australian children now lives in a household with at least one adult who is regularly binge drinking
8181375 child abuse and neglect needs to be attacked in the same comprehensive way we have tackled other serious health issues such as smoking or coronary heart disease that is to identify the risk factors promote a range of interventions and change community attitudes
8181376 if we keep the current approach with its heavy emphasis on the crisis end of the scale then we will never see these rates reduce while we must look after the children who have been abused we must do much more to stop it happening to others

8181384 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8181385 explains why he wants to give another 4 billion tax break to oil companies
8181386 at a time when america should be working harder than ever to develop new clean sources john mccain wants more of the same and has taken more than a million dollars in campaign donations from the oil and gas industry now he wants to give the oil companies another 4 billion in tax breaks four billion in tax breaks for big oil

8181392 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8181393 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8181394 we dont need four more years of the last eight years more economic stagnation more war and less diplomacy

8181396 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8181397 anyone who saw michelles speech last night knows she will be a great first lady for america
8181398 as i recall we did it before with president clinton and if we do our part well do it again with president obama
8181399 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8181400 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8181401 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8181402 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground

8181404 the russian move into georgia has begun a tectonic shift in the mideast region
8181405 it has emboldened syria hezbollah and iran to push harder against israel and the u s
8181406 russia is never after a new sanctions resolution we hope constant contacts between iran and the iaea the u n nuclear agency will lead to a realistic solution guaranteeing that iran is not after nuclear weapons technology
8181407 syrias bad negotiating position with israel is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel
8181408 ready to cooperate with russia in any way that can strengthen its security
8181409 its all adding up and one of these days were going to pay the bill for it
8181410 as a judge he always expected the best from the lawyers who appeared before him he asked them to be prepared and to respect each other and the court
8181411 he was a big proponent of my appointment he believed it was time his encouragement of me and other women to seek opportunities in the judiciary is important to the way the bench looks today
8181412 hell try to tell you that he didnt do that much for our team or that we did most of the hard work ourselves
8181413 he can find just the most amazing things with a handful of dirt and some seeds and stuff he can spin a real tale by just looking at whats there
8181414 what really sets him apart is an intense passion for what he does and a phenomenal expertise
8181415 when someone points out one part of a tapestry you can talk about the rest of it

8181418 the grand jury did not plead or prove any reasonable need for the statement to rogers breckenridge wrote she said police had interviewed the older son in 2003
8181419 continue the nut role and doing crazy things so they will think hes crazy
8181420 no matter how you spin it were not recovering to the levels we were six years ago
8181421 never before on record has poverty been higher and median income for working age households lower at the end of a multiyear economic expansion than at the beginning
8181422 more and more of our wages are going to meet just the minimum standards the food the gas our utilities
8181423 just dont have that extra money to pay for those increased expenses
8181424 in typical blagojevich fashion its all about rod he was trying in some desperate way to make himself seem somewhat relevant
8181425 it hurts sen obama to have the governor here i think if he really cared about getting sen obama elected hed stay away
8181426 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8181427 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners

8181465 its very premature to read this as a national housing recovery stabilization period
8181466 there are some regions that are doing better but housing is still struggling
8181467 when you dig down into the home sales numbers home sales rising would particularly be a good number
8181468 except that a lot of those sales are probably foreclosures and thats why you get this interesting combination of higher sales

8181473 indigenous resources are becoming more important for security of supply
8181474 but if we find oil its quick and easy to put in small low key production facilities and then tanker the oil out to refineries
8181475 its a prolonged process developing the ideas applying for the licenses and finding partners the first three or four years we were quite resource constrained
8181476 we can operate at 30 to 35 a barrel of crude offshore only the biggest companies could operate at that level
8181477 the era of cheap energy is well and truly dead and therefore britain would do well to get its energy from sensible places and think imaginatively about where those places might be
8181478 there is a huge global grab for energy going on weve got to make sure that britain is protected that we have the energy we need
8181479 its very quiet full of wildlife when you walk along the footpaths youll often come a across a deer
8181480 drilling for oil isnt compatible with a place that should be for quiet contemplation and getting away from urban life
8181481 it is our opinion that 100 million barrels of oil or even more is recoverable from the uk south of england alone possibly more
8181482 this would be advantageous to the country not just for the creation of jobs in the haulage and service maintenance sector for example but also in adding a large amount to the chancellors purse and reducing the uks energy deficit

8181526 i dont think senator obama has had a conversation with senator clinton about the vice presidency either about her or about seeking her counsel about who it should be
8181527 theres no doubt that some people are going to view this as she is not being accorded respect
8181528 she was not asked for a single piece of paper she and senator obama have never had a single conversation about it how would he know if shed take it
8181529 absolutely exhaustive research was done on her over the course of the 16 month primary she was researched more closely than any candidate in history
8181530 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
8181531 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8181532 and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8181533 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor
8181534 if we wait for the iraq danger to become clear it could be too late
8181535 we were searching for what their common ground would be
8181536 i was like man ive been healthy through training camp this is not what i need right now
8181537 ive had a few drops that i dont want to carry into the season
8181538 i just have to do what i can do and not try to compare myself to a guy thats going to be in the hall of fame
8181539 ive just got to be me and play my game
8181540 but its turned around a lot as soon as i can get my lateral movement back im fine
8181541 any time its low its just a matter of rehabbing it and getting the swelling down
8181542 just to try to get more done at rams park in a short week
8181543 its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regime after some years of neglect
8181544 as you know in the recent budget we put considerably more inspectors and resources into this
8181545 obviously we want to make sure that the companies maintain their responsibilities and that we fully review all the facts here to understand what went wrong and how we can prevent it in the future
8181546 it is proven to be effective but people dont like using it
8181547 weve shown it gets transferred to the next 100 slices or more about 90 per cent of the transfer occurred in the first 10 slices
8181548 we dont swab for listeria any more the industry does all that themselves
8181549 they just document all this stuff we read their reports if their reports say they do everything fine then they do everything fine
8181550 its like in aviation we cant look under each jet engine of an airline but we can make sure the maintenance service works
8181551 all i can say is that with the new system that has been set up theres always an adjustment phase
8181552 we expect the companies to be responsible and not just go through the motions to placate the inspectors
8181553 by the time they finish doing the paperwork theyve got very little time to actually look at anything and it bothers them
8181554 the fact is listeria needs a very high dose how did such meat products get contaminated with such a high level of listeria in order to cause so much illness it needs over a billion cells to actually cause illness
8181555 if such and such is art and such and such is art then art must mean anything created by humans which is emotionally evocative
8181556 art must mean a painting or a song or a book or a movie
8181557 well sit down at the end of the season at the appropriate time and talk about our list
8181558 i havent thought about it to be honest were just worrying about now
8181559 i dont know much about it im not involved in it
8181560 i dont get tested so i dont know how many times players do or dont get tested
8181561 the opposition has decided to stand up for lower taxes on luxury cars rather than for lower interest rates for working families
8181562 on the assumption that there was bipartisan support for taxing luxury cars in this country which was the position for 30 years
8181563 amazingly this ubiquitous phenomenon does not seem to have been noticed by herdsmen ranchers or hunters
8181564 because wind and light conditions could be excluded as a common denominator determining the body axis orientation magnetic alignment is the most parsimonious explanation
8181565 the accused has no alibi whatsoever for the night of the 7th of june when caroline byrne went off the cliff
8181566 mystical supernatural voice telling him where to go and look for her
8181567 he knew exactly where the car was he knew exactly where the body was because he had thrown it there
8181568 is of the view that a satisfactory conclusion will be reached
8181569 the matter as far as were considered is closed and well move on
8181570 today was just an ordinary board meeting and there was nothing contentious to mention
8181571 and anyway board meetings are board meetings behind closed doors and anyone that talks out of board meetings should not be on a board
8181572 i think what happens in board meetings thats where they stay but it was just an ordinary monthly meeting that we have every month
8181573 since jasons had the injury every week that hes played hes either hurt it or dislocated it and thats not going to change
8181574 if he plays on the weekend i reckon you can guarantee it will get dislocated again
8181575 it could happen with jason just putting his hand up in the air
8181576 it can happen anywhere it could happen running out the race lets hope not but it could happen
8181577 its more about the capacity for jason to one get the shoulder back in which we think we can and two his capacity to perform with it
8181578 he showed you against sydney when he kicked five goals that hes clearly capable of doing that
8181579 its hard to comprehend sometimes what it would be like going into a game believing or knowing that theres a real chance of you dislocating your shoulder especially when youre going for the ball each time
8181580 thats a really difficult thing for him to go through and it says something about his strength as an individual that hes been able to do it and still perform so well for us

8181593 non possibile che abbiano visto il mio pene troppo piccolo
8181594 sono orgogliosa di essere qua come madre come democratica come senatrice di new york come americana e sono unorgogliosa supporter di barack obama
8181595 non conta se avete votato per me o per barack
8181596 ora il momento di essere uniti come un solo partito con un unico scopo non avete lavorato cos duramente negli ultimi diciotto mesi o resistito negli ultimi otto anni per soffrire con altre leadership fallimentari
8181597 al di fuori del diritto internazionale e non si tratta soltanto dellopinione dellunione europea
8181598 non possiamo accettare simili violazioni di tutte le norme internazionali degli accordi sulla sicurezza e la cooperazione in europa delle risoluzioni delle nazioni unite e per la prima volta dopo molto tempo loccupazione di territorio in un paese vicino da parte di un esercito straniero
8181599 one or 2 is always pretty much the same thing
8181600 the change i feel is fans are really supporting me and telling me im still no 1 and still the best
8181601 i never saw my opponent before that was the tricky part
8181602 i think i have a great appeal to many fans around the world
8181603 maybe because i speak so many different languages and im so international i have a bit of an advantage im not sure
8181604 i thought the other guy played good for the pressure he was under
8181605 i went on a great roll the only thing i look back on that was a little bit unfortunate was that i was not able to stay ahead with the break in the third set
8181606 i have to start from the bottom but thats ok
8181607 i dont know whats happened there with the selection of these two players
8181608 i think the two players are going to be best served remaining with us and we will let john toshack know that
8181609 if he doesnt make saturday then obviously weve got the international break
8181610 i dont think its a question of letting him with wales its a question of being sensible because hes been out for four weeks
8181611 i dont know if hell be playing on saturday hes so fit as a person so well have to see how he gets on this week
8181612 james collins has been out for nigh on six months and is nowhere near available

8181626 we believe the z750 is such a compelling offer because not only will it be one of the best looking clamshells on the market but it also provides the tools or applications which really let you get the most from these broadband speeds
8181627 sony ericsson is continuing to deliver on the promise of the marriage of sony and ericsson with iconic products such as the z750 says najmi jarwala president sony ericsson mobile communications usa inc there is no question that hsdpa is critical for north american gsm operators and we believe products like the z750 will entice the mass market to tap into everything these faster networks enable consumers to do while on the move

8181647 child rights advocates are very concerned about the current situation and our protests have got nowhere
8181648 at least 20 needles were found and this is really worrying because they were there for a few weeks
8181649 the needles were reported to the council so that they could be cleared away and its very scary to know that this is happening
8181650 its a busy area where children play and its worrying because peoples safety is being put at risk by these needles
8181651 we know that the area has a problem and residents are very concerned about the situation
8181652 its not fair that members of the wardleworth community are having to live with needles on their streets and something needs to be done to reassure them
8181653 we have no recent records of complaints about ball street and west street but when contacted by the observer we sent a team out straight away to remove the items

8181679 purtroppo cipollone e i sostenitori dellipotesi due anni di ritardo sono ottimisti sostiene de mauro il sud conosce punte di eccellenza certo ma questo non centra dove gli allievi non raggiungono lo standard il ritardo non e misurabile in anni e epocale

8181690 premiums reflect claims and the fact is the main driver for premiums in recent years has been the increase in the cost of personal injury awards which have been rising significantly
8181691 motor insurance always has been and remains a very competitive market and people can and should shop around to get the best rates
8181692 there remains plenty of companies out there willing to provide competitive insurance but at the end of the day the costs of insurance across the board is going to be affected by the cost of claims

8181697 people know that i can give the kind of speech that i gave four years ago
8181698 theyre more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives so in that sense i think this is going to be a more workmanlike speech im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families
8181699 the better off this campaign is going to be because i think i can make the case im the right choice for them thats what i want to spend my time doing

8181706 the payloads involved are enormous in quantity and range and are mutated constantly
8181707 oh sure you might get an alert from your av when visiting an exploit because it peeks into your internet cache folder and manages to recognize part of the payload or an intermediate downloader file or the original exploit itself
8181708 by that point its far too late either your browser wasnt vulnerable and the av has valiantly protected you from nothing at all or the suspect code has already been run downloading a whole bunch of other bad stuff even if it did miraculously catch all of those and the odds arent looking good how could you possibly know for sure you were still clean there are some very hard to spot rootkits out there that your average pc using clod hasnt the faintest hope of detecting

8181711 i think overall the trend of the market is bearish right now but the hurricane premium as well as the russia nato premium is whats keeping the market from dropping further

8181730 we are delighted to have won this award and very pleased that the nations favourite broadband comparison website has named us as a winner
8181731 we have always worked hard to provide contracts to suit everyone and we believe that our short term contracts are particularly useful for those who want to try broadband or who do not know their long term plans
8181732 aol broadband prove that you dont have to pay over the odds for flexibility in your broadband package whether youre in temporary accommodation a student or not the biggest fan of commitment then aol broadbands short contract wireless flexi packages are the best on the market
8181733 im puzzled as to why some retailers have multiple entrances to its online store especially when one of them performs so badly you have to ask how many customers get fed up waiting for the main site to load and go to a competitors site instead
8181734 a recent report from imrg shows that online sales grew 38 year on year in the first six months of this year downtime and inconsistency doesnt just prevent purchasing they can ruin customer experiences and create lasting harm making sure your website is tuned to give your customers the best online experience is simply drop dead obvious
8181735 after researching the market asrs system jumped out as being most suitable for our needs as it provides the level of flexibility and functionality we require asr was also able to recommend suitable payroll software and can integrate its hr system into this software which was a key requirement importantly asr demonstrated an excellent understanding of comic relief and our needs as a charity which reassured us of the companys charity sector experience
8181736 we will be able to automatically generate hr documents such as letters and contracts and will have access to reports within seconds with the net workflow module paper based approvals will be replaced with electronic authorisations and information will get automatically routed to the relevant people across the organisation
8181737 the advanced functionality of our new asr hr system will provide us with greater knowledge and understanding of staff and both improve efficiency and free up staff time it will also cut costs and allow us to keep costs in check especially with automated processes saving us from having to recruit additional administration support as the organisation grows our ultimate goal is to replace all manual hr processes with electronic procedures to further improve efficiency asrs technology will prove key to achieving this

8181745 these three individuals were seen at the front gate of 8 croydon road very close to the time that xi zhou arrived home from work on 7 august
8181746 it is important for us to trace these three and speak to them as they may have important information
8181747 it would take a hell of an offer to let him go but ive not heard anything from anyone and i dont envisage anything happening at this late stage
8181748 i have seen camara play against my teams in the past and score against us
8181749 i didnt even know what was happening with him in the summer but hes now here for another year and im sure hes got a part to play
8181750 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8181751 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains
8181752 in future i would like to test myself in another top league
8181753 i remember the last time we went there i only played half a team because we had a monday league game against newcastle

8181757 all of us share an interest in sustaining constructive relations between our campus police and the broader harvard community in order to provide a safe and welcoming environment for all faculty students staff and visitors
8181758 i am confident that this groups efforts will help the university address this important set of issues in a constructive spirit and forthright manner
8181759 ive been hosting moderating and mediating meetings between harvards black students and university police for much of the last 20 years and it always stems from an individual incident when african americans appear to be the subject of racial profiling by the police department
8181760 the problem is a persistent one because theres still this unfortunate assumption that equates the color of a persons skin with involvement in criminality
8181761 we look forward to any recommendations generated by the process that will help ensure the hupd remains as effective as possible
8181762 if you talk to any student in the black community theyll talk about being targeted
8181763 i hope this committee will be able to initiate a thoughtful conversation that we have not been able to accomplish to date
8181764 this is really an effort to identify what the university police do well as well as what the areas of improvement potentially are were going to go at it as objectively as possible
8181765 what scraps of credibility abdullah had left after march 8 are gone
8181766 she never liked the mayor and the mayor was lukewarm toward her
8181767 were delighted the governor has seen the situation as we do and as needing to be resolved by a public hearing
8181768 we intend to present evidence that proves the mayor did not misuse public funds for personal gain and that there was no failure to appropriately inform city council about the facts of the court ordered settlement
8181769 then they seem to have come together to work together
8181770 the relationship was professional they both wanted to be able to obtain certain things for the success of both the city and the state
8181771 the mayor has defended his city the governor has defended the state
8181772 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty

8181794 older folks are skeptical of making purchases online fearing identity theft or unscrupulous retailers
8181795 but when they see others buying things with no problems they quickly opt to try it the newfangled way online
8181796 because i have a student credit card that allows me to make internet purchases without it id be paying double or triple for my books at the school bookstore whereas online i can find books second hand for a third of the price
8181797 e business by 2014 believes that eventually there will be a form of
8181798 movement towards a personal cash card not credit card is starting to begin when that day arrives payment processing for those looking to buy gaming website design stuff will be extremely easy reliable and very fast
8181799 im excited to be starting up this new e wallet
8181800 because weve noted a huge demand for gaming website design transactions online in order to meet this demand were going to need high end it and fresh programming platforms with these two elements teamed together we believe we can provide payment solutions for gaming website design companies and many others
8181801 weve got three players all vying for the same market search buy and process google and microsoft have the software and search technology while paypal boasts the most friendly payment processing online all the same google would probably prefer to vertically consolidate this process under their control while hopefully avoiding anti trust and or monopoly issues
8181802 weve slowly moved away from check processing to credit card sales
8181803 mostly because check processing takes days and credit cards are almost instant further if the check bounces and weve sold a gaming website design product it can take a month to track down the delinquent account holder and get our money back with credit cards its up to the respective bank to come up with the money
8181804 essentially we want fast processing but also very secure processing customer confidence is extremely important in the gaming website design industry and we aim to be one of the top businesses in this market in order to do that business transactions must be clean
8181805 and are also practically built into the internet its second nature to them unlike those in older demographics who have more money to purchase gaming website design items but choose to do offline
8181806 when he was running for the senate last fall he was for this measure

8181851 we believe that heinekens first half results are not as bad as feared given a strong top line the outlook for 2008 is very cautious though but provides room to over deliver
8181852 these results are more or less in line with expectations although i think the outlook for volumes is somewhat disappointing
8181853 this is a good first half performance demonstrating our competitiveness against a background of weaker economies and increased input costs we have maintained the momentum of our top line growth and again ensured that the heineken brand outperforms the market and increases its share of the international premium segment

8181875 i am excited that we have built this collaboration in order to reach the smaller drug research groups who dont want to build assets to store handle and plate compounds but just want to receive ready to screen assays from a high quality collection in exactly the format that they need to perform their drug discovery work
8181876 this represents an exciting new technology that allows a much broader base of researchers to access the world of diverse compounds in a cost effective manner
8181877 the assayready4u tm products will be offered via an innovative web based one stop shopping storefront the researchers will effortlessly select compounds assay test concentration plate format plate manufacturer and controls with a few clicks of a mouse thus optimizing their valuable time for research

8181888 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8181889 i think it could well be said that nothing has so become her campaign as the way she has ended it here tonight
8181890 sen clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment
8181891 nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8181892 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8181893 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8181894 there is not a liberal america and a conservative america there is the united states of america there is not a black america and a white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
8181895 its a very powerful speech hes going to come out of this convention the way barack obama came out of the last convention as the rock star as the next guy
8181896 it was an important speech because if this election is about experience and strength mccain wins but if this elections about the past versus the future republicans have a much tougher job
8181897 success of the propaganda campaign known as negotiations with the palestinians which convinces many that the status quo is temporary
8181898 olmerts proposal for a land swap introduces a new stage in the arrangement israel would immediately receive the settlement blocs but the land to be transferred to the palestinians and the free passage between gaza and the west bank would only be delivered after the pa retakes control of the gaza strip
8181899 over the past few months olmert has approved construction of thousands of housing units in these settlement blocs mostly around jerusalem and some are intended for the voluntary evacuees
8181900 any left wing meretz faction member could have signed on to olmerts proposal
8181901 israel also presented the palestinians with a detailed model of new security arrangements under the proposed agreement
8181902 the palestinians oppose any israeli military presence in the territory of a future palestinian state
8181903 for its part israel would like to supervise border crossings maintain a limited deployment in the jordan valley continue overflights of the palestinian territory maintain early warning stations on mountain ridges and hold emergency response units in palestinian areas
8181904 brooke informed me two days ago that very soon wed be producing our own version of two and a half men

8181906 we couldnt be more excited to add to our already big and happy family
8181907 were offering carpets and helping with legal fees and stamp duty were also using shared equity schemes although not in a massive way and helping first time buyers by matching their deposits
8181908 if you announce something and then let it drift for several weeks you can actually create a gap in the market we are looking for some progress on this
8181909 i think the main question is do you want to have something already in place in advance of a proposal or do you want to wait until you get a proposal
8181910 without having standards in place people might be concerned upset or unsure
8181911 its not an easy issue but theres got to be a fix out there
8181912 would be a taking and we would have to pay

8181945 if we became birds if we became one with the wind would our dreams come true
8181946 if we hold hands together wed make a pair of wings right
8181947 cant take eyes off from the line shown on swimwear
8181948 cant take eyes off from the line shown on her swimwear
8181949 boobs and butt they arent the ones im satisfied if i can see your shining smile
8181950 first you will see the beauty of the pictures from the title or the introduction of the story you know that the images of this game is the sky and the sea those two images were made by a group really famous for writing backgrounds
8181951 cant take eyes off from the line shown on swimwear
8181952 far from r2 its like getting to r 15 karen san plays such an outrageous active part
8181953 he says it was a tough decision to make based on his
8181954 im here tonight as a proud mother as a proud democrat as a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8181955 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8181956 my champions my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits you never gave in you never gave up and together we made history
8181957 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8181958 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8181959 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all
8181960 candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver
8181961 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8181962 if we were to do 10 ballots id support her on every one
8181963 barack obama is a charming and fine person has a lovely family but hes not ready to be president of the united states of america
8181964 his experience has not provided for him the kind of judgment and gravitas thats necessary to face the challenges in the world at large and more directly today the challenges at home
8181965 the most important national security question facing this country which is iran joe biden has been wrong
8181966 weve got a serious problem and there is a serious question as to judgment in that pick
8181967 his record is not one that is necessarily reflective of the center right
8181968 if you look at joe bidens career he really gets what the middle class is going through
8181969 barack obama and joe biden are prepared to take on the challenges facing middle class families
8181970 i believe from the bottom of my heart that with the right vision and the right leadership and the energy and creativity of the american people there is no nation that we cant outhustle or out compete
8181971 we need barack obama as the next president of the united states
8181972 ive done all the prep work now can i stick the landing
8181973 some politicians are totally caught up in the old styled politics
8181974 there are still a lot of folks who have got to get to know him
8181975 we need barack obama as the next president of the united states
8181976 the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas
8181977 when we put solutions over stalemates and when hope replaces fear
8181978 no one can speak more cogently about the challenges american families are facing
8181979 when i became governor this is what virginia faced a massive budget shortfall an economy that wasnt moving gridlock in the capital sound familiar
8181980 working together a democratic governor with a two to one republican legislature we closed the budget gap and virginia was named the best managed state in the nation
8181981 with the right leadership we can once again achieve a standard of living that is improved not diminished in each generation
8181982 almost as daunting as delivering the keynote address four years after barack obama or speaking before hillary clinton
8181983 two wars a warming planet an energy policy that says lets borrow money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us
8181984 it was also a call for consensus to reach across the aisle
8181985 what scraps of credibility abdullah had left after march 8 are gone
8181986 ive been kind of quiet and into myself about it
8181987 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
8181988 ive got nothing for you on the vice presidential front
8181989 but as a republican i hope its someone who improves our chances
8181990 someday were going to have a negro president after that were going to do something for that other minority and elect a woman
8181991 obviously you have to give credit to people involved in both of those so called minority groups blacks and women for writing lobbying and trying to bring about change
8181992 they just worked at it consistently over quite a number of years and their work has paid off in the form of statutes and supreme court decisions and so forth
8181993 came to see that what the agitators were trying to accomplish made sense so the elites went along with the people who were advocating for change
8181994 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8181995 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
8181996 what i dislike about the mccain campaign now is the karl rove strategy which is brutally simple and simply brutal

8182272 at our last members evening we were treated to a one act play the bridegroom rose early directed by our own adrian kettle who throughout the performance took on the air of an expectant father with a sofa a screen a coffee table and a few lamp bulbs removed we were very quickly transferred to a bachelor apartment so polished were the performances of the cast that even though it was not a books down performance we did not notice each member of the cast without exception portrayed their characters with such conviction that you were left wondering whether that was their true persona while at the start of the play you may have thought this a dated script we were soon transformed into the swing of it and heard a script full of wit and nuances which had us laughing having a subtle giggle or just plain smiling at each line well done to the director adrian and cast jennifer moss kim harris ruth allsopp greg tinney and ashley robbins on a cold winters evening we were treated to gluhwein and hearty soup i secretly think there was a little competition going on by the preparers of the soup and gluhwein as to whose was the best but thank you to pams mum elza lynne alison and wendy for the provisions they were all great
8182273 claremont dramatic society and wendy goddard put on neil simons barefoot in the park in august and i think that everyone involved with it had a lot of fun yes it was very hard work as plays usually are but it was all so worth it in the end the team on stage behind stage in the lighting box and our dangerous director she was always armed during the final rehearsals all pulled together to make the show the success that it was there were a few sighs of sadness on the last day knowing that this was the last time we would run the piece and that we would not be doing it again the next day everyone worked incredibly hard building the set building the characters learning the lines and ensuring that all the correct props were wrapped and ready and dealing with the odd gremlin that reared its head we learnt so much from each other the newbies from the more experienced again on stage as well as off stage and all of us from wendy thanks for all your patience time and guidance the laughter of the audience have you noticed how every audience is different in their reactions the comments of the critics and the feedback from family amp friends the feeling of satisfaction all reminded us why we do this
8182274 barefoot in the park was not without its accidents firstly while cutting beading for the front door on my table saw i ignored the rules and sliced off a fair portion of the fleshy part of my thumb what i found even more annoying was that when fitting the beading which was cut to the nearest millimetre i discovered that the door was two centimetres wider at the top than at the bottom not to be outdone by her mother wendy then ignored the rules regarding the ratchet on the winch backstage which was not properly in place in showing off her snow effect she allowed the traverse bar to fall freely and in order to save it from falling on the set put out her arm to stop it hence one broken arm after which she continued with the dress rehearsal and is now in plaster for six weeks with simons finger scotts finger celias finger adrians hand jills thumb and wendys arm we all seem to be out on a limb or maybe a hit parade ed oh and p s simons just had a hernia op but that didnt stop him from helping to build the set what we do for art
8182275 i have been house sitting and dog sitting my sons house in farnham for 2 weeks and i start another job at maidstone tomorrow for 2 weeks after that i return to haslemere for 17 days and then i return to folkstone for 2 weeks then another 2 weeks somewhere before i return to cape town on 30th september the weather has been pretty good and i have been enjoying swimming here in the outdoor heated swimming pool just about every day the labrador dog has enjoyed it too love to all
8182276 its no great secret that the proposal will involve galway coming into leinster
8182277 ill put it to you this way the request came from ourselves from central level the hdc hurling development committee were given a remit to look at how the thing could be improved
8182278 im well on record as saying that the scenario this year with antrim in particular the way they were accommodated in the championship just wasnt acceptable
8182279 now the scenario will be that well have the munster championship well have the leinster championship which will hopefully incorporate galway and antrim and well be asking the leinster council to facilitate that structure
8182280 if that happens it means its a level playing field for everybody they play in their respective munster and leinster championships then those who are knocked out at the earlier stages come into pool one and those who lose at semi final stage go into pool two so at least we can get a continuity of games at all stages through the summer
8182281 i think it will mean a level playing field for everybody while maintaining the integrity of the provincial championships it also means the galways and antrims of this world will have less reason to be concerned with their set up from here on in
8182282 that will be put before congress in early october im not certain if its going to be the only proposal but that will certainly be the key proposal
8182283 i think were saying this now for the sake of hurling ever since i became involved at central level over 10 years ago ive probably had an involvement every year over some restructuring of hurling or other
8182284 we need to stop chopping and changing we need to give it a chance to bed in and i think it will be the final chance well have to put a decent structure on it
8182285 its not easy munster want to have their competition we have to try and accommodate galways wishes about not being in a province antrim want to retain some involvement in ulster we have to try and give two games to everybody so before you start looking at any system youre working with at least one hand tied behind your back
8182286 its not easy to come up with a system that suits everybody but on this occasion probably for the first time were putting in a system thats coming from central level where were saying this is what we want the hurling championship to be its unlike in the past where we sat down with everybody and tried to rejig to suit their needs
8182287 i do not know why we are always under pressure to buy 30 million or 40 million players
8182288 we can buy a robinho but we have not to look at chelsea or manchester united or liverpool we have to look at ourselves
8182289 we have no complex with the names the names dont impress me what is impressive for me is the attitude and the quality and all the rest is the media
8182290 i am under pressure to buy good players and good players are not always necessarily linked with the price of a player there is still a market to buy the right players we are struggling to find them but we will find them dont worry
8182291 we have the required squad and i believe in the players i have instead of always looking at who might be coming in
8182292 we lost only three games last year and why should we not be capable of repeating that
8182293 thaksin is happy to sell off a chunk but wants to retain the majority
8182294 but they potential investors want all of it everybody wants all of it they all want a football club
8182295 i have had representatives of companies from dubai saudi arabia and kuwait on to me
8182296 some of them have phoned the supporters club because they couldnt find the club number so i get the supporters club asking me if the club is for sale so ive got to deal with all that
8182297 we tell them that the club isnt for sale we are looking for new investment it might not be the selling of a stake and weve got five or six options
8182298 we consider bojan our player he feels spanish he is a tremendous kid and we count on him

8182319 as reported last week we had concerns about a possible infestation of fleas from urban foxes living under the building
8182320 the building has already been treated and some maintenance work carried out to prevent animals getting under the building but we want to do everything possible to prevent a repeat
8182321 so for the safety and comfort of patients and staff we will be undertaking further repair and prevention work and taking the opportunity to have a deep clean during the closed period we apologise for any inconvenience to patients
8182322 i am surprised that our walk in centre and dental access centre are closed again
8182323 it is clear that the flea infestation has not been dealt with properly and that is a cause for great concern this smacks of incompetence and i am afraid it is simply not good enough
8182324 i will be writing to trevor purt chief executive of our pct asking for a reassurance that the health of the people of rochdale has not been compromised as result of this infestation
8182325 this is our personal contribution towards the rochdale observers can you spare a minute campaign
8182326 we will be serving up breakfast and there will be music and a raffle
8182327 hopefully if its a nice morning we can eat it out on the patio

8182334 if differences are intrinsic then anyone can see them if there is an objective reality then any impartial observer can make judgments unaffected and untainted by his or her own perspective or experience once rules are selected regardless of disputes over the rules themselves a distinct aspiration is that they will be applied evenhandedly this aspiration to impartiality however is just that an aspiration rather than a description because it may suppress the inevitability of the existence of a perspective and thus make it harder for the observer or anyone else to challenge the absence of objectivity what interests us given who we are and where we stand affects our ability to perceive philosophers such as a j ayer and w v quine note that although we can alter the theory we use to frame our perceptions of the world we cannot see the world unclouded by preconceptions the impact of the observer s perspective may be crudely oppressive yet we continue to believe in neutrality

8182344 its absolutely disgraceful and i believe it will be dangerous for patients it will be putting their lives at risk
8182345 what will happen to patients with a bleed or who need a major operation even a minor operation carries risks and if something went wrong it could have devastating consequences
8182346 four pints of blood will not save anyones life by the time a taxi has been sent to collect more blood the person could be dead
8182347 this decision could mean that a lot of procedures will have to stop i think it signals the end for the infirmary they shouldnt be doing this
8182348 we are starting discussions with scientists and clinical staff about the possibility of running a trial service for urgent blood transfusions as we believe this could bring benefits for both urgent and non urgent work
8182349 if adopted emergency blood would still be available at the infirmary currently there are two emergency stock fridges with four units of o negative each which can be used for any patient each unit is 250ml this would remain the same
8182350 in addition there would be an emergency stock of probably around 20 units of o positive the precise stock level would still have to be decided on as part of the discussions with clinicians ahead of the trial
8182351 as discussions among clinicians are only starting on this we do not have final details or a proposed start date but we will let people know if that is finalised
8182352 most of the pathology functions have already been transferred from rochdale to our other labs if the trial was successful the staff would transfer and all routine analysis would be done at other labs
8182353 this relocation of staff would strengthen the overall service and enable us to provide higher quality there is certainly no imminent transfer planned and any move would take place in line with our normal processes
8182354 people in the area tried for seven weeks to get the council to empty the bins but nothing happened
8182355 i would like to say a huge thank you to councillor ashworth for helping to sort this out for me within a day of contacting her the waste had been removed

8182555 infosys acquisition of axon for ukp 407 million is not only little expensive from a valuation stand point the timing of it too is probably little wrong as we expect the pound and euro to depreciate against the usd which would mean the rupee could end up appreciating against the two in the near future the resultant acquisition is not going to lead to any boost in earnings and the company would end up report an earnings of rs 102 for fy09 and rs 130 for fy10 the conundrum the company is facing whether to forego revenues for margins or margins for revenues
8182556 till yesterday the company did not buck to the pressure but now with the acquisition there is a feeling the company wants to chase revenues and not defend margins that is the massive change in the strategy however i continue with my positive rating as the revenue base and client base has increased though the jury is out on the margins we maintain with our buy rating with a price target of rs 2250 as we believe there is no threat to our earnings and the cash is made to productive use

8182575 that said theres some pretty good news on the horizon regarding adjunctive medications medications that supplement other forms of therapy to produce a greater yield in terms of recovery from alcoholism
8182576 what that probably reflects kirk is the fact that there are multiple different alcoholisms and different people who are in stages of alcoholism its not just one disease or one process
8182577 its a great new field thats coming out lot of new medications will be coming soon but it doesnt replace treatment but it can sure make treatment a lot more effective
8182578 yes in fact theyve done testing on the drugs alone and they found they failed but they found when they did testing it with treatment it greatly improved treatment you just cant replace theres a lot more to stopping drinking than just stopping drinking

8182591 what will bring closure is for my brother to get well not so much the arrests i mean we want them to be arrested of course but thats not our focus yeah that would be nice so they dont do it again but its for my brother to be completely healed recovered and out of the hospital and back with us again

8182605 he has been killed police have recovered his body and are trying to bring it down from the top of the mountain
8182606 its the worst thing that could possibly happen its what we hoped would never happen
8182607 we must not waste itos efforts i believe we should continue our activities
8182608 if we are moving in the direction of a new cold war it will be harder to find a joint solution to problems such as the nuclear conflict with iran
8182609 of course cooperation on the iran issue could fall victim to the current confrontation between the united states and russia but this does not have to be the case
8182610 in past months the u s has moved away from unilateralism on this question and moved towards more multilateralism
8182611 it makes the enforcement of already ratified sanctions against tehran more challenging and significantly reduces the chances of consensus for the imposition of a fourth round of punitive sanctions against our nation
8182612 the downward spiral in relations between russia and the west will make it harder to work together on anything and iran policy heads the list of areas that are going to suffer
8182613 finding consensus on additional security council sanctions was hard to begin with
8182614 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
8182615 does not see an action against iran as the right thing to do at the moment
8182616 it will not become easier to lead a third war in the middle east just because one now also faces a conflict with russia
8182617 its no use denying theres a huge amount of tension in the relationship following the georgia intervention but there will be a lot of determination to keep the iran show on the road
8182618 everyone believes russia will no longer join u s pressure on iran
8182619 hostility to the war at home in the middle east and elsewhere in the world has had negative effects on the u s image and ability to galvanise the international community on any issue be it the iranian threat or even support for georgia
8182620 tensions are mounting in the nuba mountains region development plans are overshadowed by the danger of a return to open conflict
8182621 the area is highly militarized with both parties to the conflict actively violating the cpa by recruiting members of armed groups
8182622 definitely theres trouble ahead you just have to look at the frustration

8182625 im here tonight as a proud mother as a proud democrat as a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8182626 most of all i ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years those are the reasons i ran for president and those are the reasons i support barack obama for president
8182627 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8182628 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region

8182636 weve always watched them as we watch all the other groups

8182650 weve always watched them as we watch all the other groups
8182651 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out
8182652 they are better than flip flops which i also frequently wear and i cant wear tennis shoes every day
8182653 its against my law i am a mom in red high heels
8182654 i always hated japan and ive come to hate it more these days
8182655 i explode with anger whenever they say its their territory
8182656 japans past wrongdoing and its colonial rule are condensed in these tiny islets
8182657 japan is of the view that both sides should respond calmly to this issue recognizing the differences in positions between our countries as differences in positions
8182658 we found the abducted japanese man minutes ago he has been shot several times
8182659 but we are waiting to see in person to make 100 percent sure it is him
8182660 was a male body that appears to be of a japanese national
8182661 police closed the circle on abductors that is why they left him there bleeding
8182662 i do not foresee any improvement in these issues for at least a year
8182663 declared him fit to run for political office and free of any symptoms
8182664 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8182665 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8182666 will consider soon a step to restore the nuclear facilities in yongbyon to their original state
8182667 will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8182668 weve been very clear with north korea that there will be action for action
8182669 and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks
8182670 driving toward the base and before it got to the gate it blew up
8182671 i would say some people thought we were going to die the woman sitting in the seat in front of us was whimpering
8182672 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible
8182673 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8182674 i was scared i think everyone was scared ive got three kids and my wife on the flight and i just sat there helplessly thinking it might be the end
8182675 i would say the crew didnt know what to do they didnt inform us for about 20 minutes which i think was wrong a little information would have calmed everyone down
8182676 my wifes oxygen bag inflated and so did my sons mine stayed flat all around me people kept tugging and saying its not working properly
8182677 the first thing we do in these situations is take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8182678 they usually inflate when passengers exhale its a trickle of pure oxygen you dont feel a rush of gas all its doing is enriching the low pressure air
8182679 the pilot is having to navigate having to communicate with air traffic control and having to avoid hitting other aeroplanes his priority is to keep the aeroplane safe
8182680 they satisfy every single safety level but it is the minimum
8182681 the negotiations between the libyan negotiator and the hijacker have started
8182682 india has no reason to clamp down on peaceful protests
8182683 all around peshawar on every side the situation is volatile because of the people coming from bajaur bara dera adam khel and the people from swat and waziristan
8182684 all of this is impacting the infrastructure in peshawar the schools the health system everything is overloaded
8182685 we had no idea it was going to happen the government didnt tell us anything and we didnt see them anywhere
8182686 we are doing what we can to support the people here

8182690 what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
8182691 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
8182692 but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given
8182693 nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
8182694 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
8182695 killing people seeing people be killed and nearly being killed
8182696 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
8182697 i dont have any definite answers but it is a great opportunity to promote olympic sports
8182698 we won three medals in beijing but that also gives us a lot of responsibility to keep this momentum going
8182699 weve to give our athletes the best opportunity to perform well at london 2012
8182700 we need to have a goal how we want to do going ahead if we are to replicate our performance
8182701 they say a man is never satisfied and im not
8182702 next time i will try to get a gold medal in london
8182703 i must say the moldovan had the best defence among all the boxers in beijing he never dropped his guard during the bout
8182704 on the other hand akhil is a very fearless boxer and he plays with his guards down but thats his style technically there was no problem
8182705 he is a very emotional person and was really affected by the quarterfinal loss but put up a brave face to keep the spirits up in the camp he said so what if i have lost jitender and vijender have to accomplish the task and he kept himself upbeat for them
8182706 he always had the confidence and he now has the required experience and that made all the difference in 2012 he can definitely go for the gold
8182707 things are looking upward for the indian boxers as you can see the way jitender 51 kg fought it is one of the best olympics for any boxer
8182708 earlier we were seventh in the asian rankings and now we are fourth and if we had not missed these two bronze we would have been on top india has massive talent pool in boxing
8182709 thats the plan so far lets see how things go from here
8182710 its been a hectic four months now and i want to go home
8182711 they were always at par with other boxers in the world in technique but they lacked confidence psychology was the difference between the athens and the beijing lot
8182712 it is an exciting team on paper and steve harmison coming out of retirement has been a real boost
8182713 we have had roughly the same players for the last 18 months but the roles are changing slightly it looks a side with depth in bowling and batting as well as fielding so we must not let up
8182714 we can only apologise for what was a poor performance
8182715 a defeat like this can be demoralising but we have come back before
8182716 it was a massive victory because we have qualified to play in the asian cup the biggest tournament in asian football
8182717 it changes things for us because now you get to play with the biggest teams
8182718 ive worked with so many coaches but he is a complete manager from technical training to managing players
8182719 it is up to us the system to give good players
8182720 players have to be absolutely intelligent and not look at the finance alone as they sometimes do
8182721 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories
8182722 of the 2 519 batsmen who have taken the crease in 131 years of test cricket bradman stands alone and untouched
8182723 i am no aware of any other sport which has one competitor so far above any other performer
8182724 players with very little experience at the top level are criticising someone whose contribution to indian tennis is legendary leander had a talk with me he didnt want to go through that embarrassment once again and decided to step down
8182725 there was a time when the amritrajs and the krishnans did not see eye to eye as the then india coach i saw it from close quarters but they didnt make the spat public
8182726 see our resource is limited we didnt have a big pool to choose from still the aita had given the players an ultimatum but leander chose to quit in the interest of indian tennis
8182727 lots of people were interested for the post some very big names we have given him the job to avoid controversy romania would be a very tough proposition on clay whoever is the captain
8182728 in any case leander will play only in the doubles knowing him his intensity wont drop
8182729 i dont know exactly what happened between leander and the other players but in davis cup its always better to have a non playing captain it would be a sacrilege to deny his contribution but he and mahesh are not getting younger its time now to move on and shift focus to the youngsters prakash amritraj and somdev dev burman they are the future of indian tennis
8182730 as the it and telecom requirements of the enterprises are increasing we aim to become a one stop shop for all their requirements be it voice data application security or any other such need
8182731 as a part of the mns we are also in the process of introducing global audio conferencing to our subscribers
8182732 there are two ways to think about this existence we have one of them is that its wednesday and its three fifteen and were talking here in my home and at four oclock i have to leave for another meeting now thats a reality but theres another reality were in the solar system of a second rate star three quarters of the way out on a spiral arm of an average galaxy in a thing called the local group and ours is only one of billions of galaxies each of which has billions of stars some star systems are binary and there could be a planet that revolves around a center of gravity between two binary stars so youd have two sunrises and two sunsets every day one could be a red giant the other a white dwarf two different sized shaped and colored suns in the sky and there might be other planets and comets in other words fuck wednesday fuck three fifteen fuck four oclock fuck the united states fuck the earth its all temporal bullshit i like thinking about being out there and not thinking about the corporate structure not worrying about freedom and not worrying about guns i chose a life of ideas that entertains me that nourishes me
8182733 is just a word used by people to medicalize fat
8182734 tease out who is engaging in compulsive overeating or bingeing versus who is fat for reasons that arent what youd describe as psychologically unhealthy but that end up being aesthetically vile
8182735 we dont seem to care about compulsive overeating as long as the body looks a certain way so its not really about the practice its about the aesthetics
8182736 in general terms what we are still saying is your value lies in the way you look
8182737 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8182738 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8182739 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8182740 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8182741 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8182742 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8182743 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8182744 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8182745 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8182746 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8182747 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8182748 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8182749 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8182750 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8182751 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8182752 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8182753 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8182754 marketers are starting to personalize in store promotions based on products the consumer recently picked off a shelf or purchased and in the near future based on what the shopper looks like
8182755 so that when a customer pulls the product off the shelf a digital screen at eye level changes its message
8182756 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8182757 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8182758 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8182759 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8182760 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8182761 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8182762 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8182763 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8182764 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8182765 who are open to doing something on the production side
8182766 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8182767 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8182768 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8182769 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8182770 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8182771 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8182772 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8182773 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8182774 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8182775 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8182776 co o por lo menos que le pongan subt tulos
8182777 am very interested to also learn how to stop my chihuahuas from running up down the stairs i have tried to walk up the stairs first blocking them on every third step or so sometimes it works other times the three little brats run past me and believe it or not these brats do not respond to treats
8182778 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8182779 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8182780 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8182781 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8182782 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8182783 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8182784 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8182785 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8182786 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8182787 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8182788 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8182789 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8182790 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8182794 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8182795 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8182796 this is a significant step for me to get back out on the practice field
8182797 if things go well as we expect they will then i hope to be full go next week and ready for the season opener
8182798 if i had to tilt one way or the other like an airplane id tilt that way
8182799 i would assume that hell probably say no and if thats the case so be it
8182800 some of the expenses claimed by defendant clearly should have been deleted by the court
8182801 i am very happy to be back healthy playing well and winning the first round is always great fun
8182802 it was a good match to start off with i never saw my opponent before and that was the tricky part i thought the other guy played good for the pressure he was under
8182803 i wish i could play normal matches and enjoy tennis sometimes
8182804 i dont get that release as a message dont get me wrong its hard to see a good buddy like that go i come in and i hope others dont need something like that to let you know our jobs are not promised you our contracts are not guaranteed for a reason
8182805 for two years 2000 01 i sat on the couch with a knee injury so i know what it feels like not to have a job when i come in whether its 03 04 or 08 my mentality is i worry about kenny wheaton and his family back home in the sense that ive got to figure out a way to feed them and house them
8182806 its my job to put as good a group of players as we can on the football field at all times its always a surprise because i dont think that people believe theyre going to get cut any player strikes back we as a society think thats a good thing because we have to report whats negative ive been fired before and all i did was go clean my desk out and leave people react different ways to different situations do i think we treated anybody unfairly no
8182807 we assume this position when we become professional football players
8182808 in our line of work our contracts are not guaranteed and its a part of the business guys move on guys move in its hard to deal with but thats how it is it is what it is hes gone weve got to deal with it were grown men weve got to go out there and win football games with orlondo he just felt like he was disrespected being a co captain and a guy that was a captain for four years
8182809 if i owned maple leaf meats today im probably in a desperate situation but i dont think the argonauts are
8182810 we only do things to win im not in this business to build character my way of living life is based on the number of wins i get it has nothing to do with anything else in the sports world if youre a maple leafs fan its all built around the number of wins you get thats why theres a revolving door here
8182811 if it doesnt work then you go do something different the definition of stupidity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result we had to change
8182812 its been an up and down career so far and this is one of the ups
8182813 i think that in a couple of years well be a team to watch for
8182814 i think thats the most overrated part of my game
8182815 i think that when i do fight i do well but thats not what i try to go out and do
8182816 if a guy is going to challenge me or take liberties with my teammates then ill do it the game i want to play is to be a skilled power forward i want to be able to bang and crash but not too much so that it takes away from my skill level
8182817 here you cant go five or 10 games without a point without anyone noticing and there the u s you can go under the radar a little bit
8182818 thats one thing that i think is going to benefit not just myself but this team i think you are under the gun here and under the pressure of having to perform
8182819 obviously im well aware i wasnt the most popular pickup in calgary flames history but at the same time i think youve got to give it a little time and give me a chance
8182820 i cant lie to you its not the jersey i thought i was going to wear but at the same time i played enough games here to know what kind of fan base and what kind of team they are
8182821 in anaheim i thought it was going to be a good opportunity but i just didnt fit into the mode there with ice time playing 10 to 12 minutes a game its kind of hard to perform
8182822 we were over there and they were taking pictures and the only time ive seen this was in l a when we got on a red carpet once in a while not at the rink
8182823 ill definitely be living off that moment for a while its going to take me a year to come down off that
8182824 serena and i we did talk because we love the olympics so much we were saying oh wow we just want to play this forever
8182825 so we talked about playing the 2016 olympics who knows maybe by then well have a life and not be chasing a ball maybe well have kids
8182826 if not even if so maybe well still try to play
8182827 yeah this is definitely going in the right direction edwards said
8182828 i feel like im getting close to 100 per cent and the sooner i get there the better

8182832 there is no change in the itinerary bangalore will host the first test
8182833 the atp board can confirm that it has regrettably accepted a petition from the bangalore open to suspend the 2008 event due to the local promoters security concerns
8182834 the total event prize money of 400 000 dollars will now be paid into the atp player pension fund

8182836 vernon was just starting to get hot when he got hurt with his hamstring in mid july
8182837 hes just kind of picked up where he left off
8182838 i guess ive pretty much gone through three spring trainings
8182839 getting that fourth run in the seventh was real nice
8182840 if you stay in this world you will never learn another one
8182841 this is not the time for excuses we have been outplayed england are playing with huge motivation and huge aggression
8182842 we have got to find out what the problem is we have got a lot of experience and we have got to tap into a bit of that
8182843 we have had times on this tour when we have had to look at each other honestly and find out what mistakes we are making our rhythm and confidence is not right i dont think reading the riot act is going to help
8182844 outside of world cup semi finals this is right down there in terms of lows we did not assess conditions well enough
8182845 we have got to look at ourselves and match the england team in the way we have matched in the time that i have been involved all of us need to get together
8182846 it was not a 280 wicket and that affected how we played there was a bit of bounce but if we could have got 230 we could have put them under a pressure but when you are only chasing 80 you play with freedom
8182847 i am trying to get into him that it is really great to be on a wave but you have got to get to a level where you are cool and calm and deliver
8182848 it has a certain quiet elegance to it that is timeless and never quite goes out of style
8182849 on my first record i didnt have a direction i just wanted to make a record
8182850 i feel pass it along is the best body of work ive done this is where i am now and where ive come from

8182855 weve been passing out the rights for 50 years and theyre capitalised in the land
8182856 in some regions if you get land that has access to water its probably worth 5000 to 25 000 hectare extra
8182857 this is nothing new the slope has been pretty slippery for the past 150 years
8182858 this is heading down the track of privatisation of water and creating ownership rights so it can be traded
8182859 the government would not support such a move as we believe water is owned by all new zealanders
8182860 it could overshadow the rights of ordinary people to have a say for example about rivers and streams they wish to swim or fish in and drink from

8182862 roadshow dilakukan sekitar oktober tetapi saya tidak bisa mengatakan saat ini destinasinya kemana saja
8182863 kalau kita lihat kemarin itu asingnya ada sedikit total cuma 12 kalau kita lihat obligasi negara reguler itu asing kan bisa sampai 60 bahkan pernah sampai 80 jadi itu berarti sisanya asing akan masuk ke global sukuk jadi kita tidak khawatir
8182864 kalau kita lihat dari duit yang masuk mereka bank syariah itu memang sedikit ya wajar karena kapasitasnya lebih kecil dibanding bank konvensional tapi ke depan dengan kebijakan khusus kita akan memperbesar porsi kepemilikan sukuk oleh institusi keuangan syariah dan kita akan merancang berbagai macam sukuk dengan struktur yang cocok dengan kebutuhan masing masing investor

8182870 kami juga belum menghitung nilai kerugian dari produksi yang tidak berjalan mulus situasinya sudah gawat dan menimbulkan kerugian yang tidak terhingga khususnya di kalangan masyarakat
8182871 kalau terus begini yang rugi masyarakat riau juga investor mana yang mau menanamkan investasinya di riau kalau infrastruktur listriknya saja terbatas masalah krisis listrik ini semestinya menjadi perhatian penting buat pemerintah daerah
8182872 harus segera diantisipasi karena semua aspek terimbas kondisi ini mestinya pemerintah daerah memiliki konsep kelistrikan yang memadai bullshit saja kalau pemerintah daerah gembar gembor bicara kemajuan pembangunan dan kesejahteraan bagi masyarakatannya kalau urusan listrik saja tidak bisa mereka atasi

8182911 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come

8182925 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8182926 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

8182929 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8182930 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

8182934 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8182935 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8182936 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

8182938 its a war for identity i am a kashmiri muslim and my dress and look have got nothing to do with what i am shouting for
8182939 this is the generation that was born in the bloody 1990s and grew up in the machiavellian 2000s they have lived and outsmarted violence they enjoy the consumerist goodies but have an anger latent in their hearts and minds
8182940 this generation symbolises the future of kashmir and is politically more aware than their previous generations
8182941 we no longer trust any leaders not even the mirwaizs and the geelanis chairmen of their respective factions of the separatist hurriyat conference not to talk of the abdullahs and the muftis mainstream politicians of the world
8182942 i wish someone was in the driving seat to channel and steer our energy and enthusiasm but all politicians are busy in petty politics
8182943 it was a lull before the storm the uprising we see now is the hidden anger it typifies the failure of efforts by india to win the hearts and minds of muslim kashmiris

8182949 we are stalled out here weve got to address how we get the next 30 percent of those students particularly in the elementary and middle grades
8182950 we have a lot of turmoil around mathematics right now were in a transition
8182951 i think it was very telling that our fourth graders and seventh graders have again gone down in math and reading
8182952 i have a big concern were headed in the wrong direction
8182953 educators still have concerns about the way the wasl is being used as a high stakes test we may be proposing additional changes during the legislative season to the way the wasl is used
8182954 the obvious next step is to identify those students and determine the interventions needed to support them
8182955 the trend in auburn has been a leveling off over the last three years
8182956 what it means for us is we have got to do something different
8182957 in particular we are happy with the gains for all subjects in fifth sixth and eighth grades
8182958 while we did see gains in scores for the 2008 school year in many cases the gains were not enough to meet school and district goals
8182959 as a result we will need to continue our focused efforts to support bethel students that are still not meeting standard
8182960 our 10th grade scores in writing are above the state standard so that is a big celebration for us
8182961 there is some good news in reading and writing at the comprehensive high schools with 85 to 90 percent of students meeting standards
8182962 we continue to work hard on math at all levels and that is one of our key priorities in the district
8182963 i believe our teachers are always trying to look at students one student at a time to try to meet their needs
8182964 we are proud of the work of our staff and students we are most pleased with the performance of the students in our recent graduating class
8182965 like many districts we continue to see some schools and grade levels where scores are increasing or decreasing by two or three points from year to year
8182966 these fluctuations reflect the academic performance of one group of students to another and are to be expected over time
8182967 last year several of our elementary schools put additional focus on mathematics and their student performance in math increased while reading and writing scores declined slightly
8182968 we must learn to improve achievement in all areas without losing past gains
8182969 its hard work but were focused on our long term goal of getting all students to 100 percent
8182970 our staff continues to rise to every new bar thats set for them
8182971 i think we have a plan for the first time
8182972 he told me get a plan and let me see what i can do
8182973 if we can close it one day and start replacing the cables the next id be all for it
8182974 its about access to the other side that the bridge can provide
8182975 i dont want us taking ownership of the bridge yet
8182976 i dont know how we could get a better more fair contract than this if we waited
8182977 its unclear to me why any county would sign with the current corporate representatives when we know theyre in the middle of a sale
8182978 its short sighted for the county to sign the contract and tie the hands not only of this generation but the next
8182979 i thought the idea to site the landfill at 304th was a mistake but i dont have control over that
8182980 the question is does pierce county control what goes into it
8182981 we were saying how you could smell the air and evergreens
8182982 it was a very hard 15 months there was something missing
8182983 i think this country is about to stand for itself
8182984 i wish it were three to nine months like the marines and air force
8182985 tel aviv court yesterday has rejected taros contention that sun pharma should have conducted a special tender offer under israeli law
8182986 the court stated that the directors should have studied the agreements prior to their being signed and should have confirmed then that they were in the companys best interest
8182987 it is clear based on yesterdays ruling that the lawsuit by taros independent directors was part of a calculated effort by barry levitt to avoid living up to his obligations under the optio n agreement

8182990 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8182991 gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8182992 because the iphone doesnt support flash or java you couldnt really see the internet in its full glory
8182993 they made a very general claim that you can see the internet in its entirety and actually thats not quite true so weve upheld
8182994 adeona is the first open source system for tracking the location of your lost or stolen laptop that does not rely on a proprietary central service
8182995 he suffered a head wound against cheltenham and it re opened last saturday we just keep stitching him up bandaging him up and putting him out there
8182996 he is still not 100 per cent as he is coming to terms with having a steel rod taken out of his leg in the summer but is making progress
8182997 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8182998 and youve got a lot of concern and i think its very warranted about other forms of debt coming due and youre seeing delinquency rates on credit cards for example going up to levels you havent seen in a long time
8182999 to pursue profit oriented growth strategies in a protected market that is far less penetrated than the u s
8183000 then there are some other less hard nosed things like the prevalence of 90 a month all you can eat plans in the u s market from some of the value competitors
8183001 we havent seen the same degree of really aggressive pricing from canadian competitors yet there are some plans out there but we havent seen a real proliferation of them
8183002 weve got a new opportunity with the inauguration to turn the page get a new relationship with a new administration
8183003 weve got to really have a sophisticated full court press on canadas issues with the united states of america and thats certainly what the prime minister is interested in
8183004 if the only way to produce those resources would be at a significant penalty to climate change then we dont believe that those resources are going to play a growing role in the long term future
8183005 we can have that conversation with clean hands with the americans and say look were doing our bit to cap emissions
8183006 we would like to know what their plan is say to them if youre not going to endorse kyoto were not doing it either we understand that but now what is the plan
8183007 if the u s didnt want the oil itll go into the oil market anyway so they have to be very careful about looking at the whole picture
8183008 our point is going to be what we need first in canada and the united states is an energy policy which we dont have right now
8183009 we need leadership from the governments of both canada and the united states to say heres our plan and then go out and sell it and support it instead of running and hiding every time a protester comes and says well we dont want you to do this any more
8183010 the impact of the deterioration in the u s housing market has affected our results and while uncertainty exists we are confident in the earnings capacity of the core franchise said president and chief executive bill downe
8183011 consumers are getting hurt on the way up and hurt on the way down
8183012 our purpose is to shed light on what is obviously going to be a growing concern you cant simply write off what happened between january and july
8183013 ive never seen this kind of thing before weve always had a slight advantage over montreal
8183014 why arent we seeing 1 15 i dont know why
8183015 i kind of thought myself it would be coming down a bit more
8183016 its a myriad of factors that go into pump prices so that makes it difficult to explain
8183017 that strong dollar really kept our prices low for a long period of time
8183018 but the wind has gone out of the sails of the canadian dollar
8183019 thats a lot when youre selling 65 billion litres of the product every year
8183020 these margins need explanation and nobody has come forth and given me any
8183021 we are routinely held to the highest prices because we have no competition
8183022 we dont try to protect our data amp come up with new formats only for marketing reasons we use existing standards as much as possible and allow fl studio to be used as a plugin in other hosts
8183023 the role for the ceo is very limited and early in the process
8183024 if the ceo messes up theres no one left to go in and fix it but if a high level operations person gets into trouble the ceo can go in and save the day
8183025 as public relations people we shouldnt be speaking for a company not our own
8183026 you need to provide the facilities to manage a 24 7 situation
8183027 dont lay blame and try to be defensive not owning up to the situation
8183028 if the truth is that youre responsible you have to acknowledge that
8183029 recent data suggest that the canadian gross domestic product growth in the second quarter was likely somewhat weaker than the 0 8 per cent growth expected
8183030 theres at least a 50 per cent chance of having a negative number the canadian export numbers are truly awful
8183031 we have a canadiana image that bodes well for international appeal our doughnut is fun delicious and indulgent the type of thing you look forward to enjoying on your day off this resonates with people all over the world
8183032 food is food but the people are the ingredients that make the business successful
8183033 franchising is not a guaranteed income but it is a guaranteed opportunity
8183034 start to identify what type of business you are interested in and do your research in a thorough manner due diligence is important you are going into a long term business relationship and have to treat it that way
8183035 i am back in moscow and i will not play in kiev and i can confirm i am going to tottenham
8183036 i am waiting for a visa and as soon as it is granted i am ready to go to england and sign
8183037 juande ramos i have not yet met it seems like he will call me but i know for sure he is very interested in my services
8183038 weve been waiting for this for over two years it is a victory for thousands bringing overwhelming relief to desperate people across the country
8183039 finally the torment faced by elderly people forced to either spend their life savings on private treatment or go blind is over
8183040 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 10 000 for each eye treated but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings
8183041 it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 8 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period
8183042 our guidance means that patients who are suitable for this treatment will have the same access to it irrespective of where they live
8183043 im so happy i have been fighting to get treatment for over a year and a half so this is the best news ive had since i started to lose my sight
8183044 what i now need is for wandsworth pct to contact me with my first appointment ill then be able to look forward to the future
8183045 we are delighted that nice have confirmed final guidance for amd
8183046 lucentis is a treatment for a key unmet medical need and it has the potential to save many peoples sight
8183047 its certainly a headline grabber because its such a significant drop
8183048 its turned out to be a very different market this year than it was last year
8183049 the big question is what is happening to the economy particularly in the u s if they sink deeper than where they are right now we will have further problems
8183050 while large pools of capital continue to be available in canada to qualified buyers of commercial real estate investments lenders today are much more stringent in their lending requirements than they were in the past
8183051 if you had 10 buyers for the same property last year you might be down to five this year
8183052 a strong second half is unlikely to occur this year because what began as a subprime credit crisis in the u s has become a de leveraging of all global asset classes
8183053 we expect the investment market as a whole to be 40 per cent lower possibly even more
8183054 transaction volumes and capital values plummeted as the commercial property market suffered under financial liquidity constraints
8183055 on the whole we are pleased to announce that the results are encouraging and we believe that the data collected and analyzed would go along way to inform policy formulation and the institution of best practices in ghanas procurement
8183056 to non profit organisations savings in procurement means more resources are available to undertake additional infrastructural projects for sustainable development
8183057 effective and efficient monitoring and evaluation of public procurement for sustainable national development
8183058 in spite of the distance exports from peru to turkey increase dramatically as a result of the 25 million tourists visiting the country every year
8183059 in 2004 ghana exported over 70 000 metric tonnes but last year only 40 000 tonnes worth 12 million were exported
8183060 we believe that the suspects who bought the car with the forged currency could not have used all their money to purchase it and suspect they still have more hidden somewhere
8183061 strong message can be sent to the people of kashmir as well as the international community

8183073 we have continued our surveillance efforts this year for these diseases and will enhance local efforts as needed through state sponsored mosquito trapping
8183074 i am hopeful that this wnv eee season will be short and that we will have an early frost but people should continue to be vigilant with prevention measures such as wearing mosquito repellent until that time there are several effective mosquito repellents available and people are encouraged to choose the one that works best for them and use it consistently
8183075 the trip was special memorable and a lot of hard work
8183076 when i came home and watched the olympics it was unreal because i had been on those streets and been to those places
8183077 you see those places on t v all the time
8183078 but to see them in person was completely different just incredible
8183079 you could tell by looking at a person that they held such pride in hosting the olympic games
8183080 there were a lot of candidates for that offensive coordinator job
8183081 a lot of people call here when we have openings
8183082 were constantly making sure we have players in the right position academically to graduate and graduate early we take great pride here in the academic progress and academic success of our players
8183083 thats one of the most difficult things about this job
8183084 with the way the rules are we are not allowed to spend time with our guys during the summer
8183085 being a good coordinator has to do with people skills and your ability to get your players to play at a high level
8183086 hes embraced all the quarterbacks and made us comfortable with what he is teaching
8183087 a lot of people and programs are being affected so were hoping one will follow the other and roll right along
8183088 the idea is to get the north gym where its more user friendly and easier to find people
8183089 its really going to help the athletics department run better
8183090 the thomas building will be renovated to help us add much needed office space for programs that will benefit from being in the center of campus and allow us to improve services for students
8183091 on the very first day of school you can look them up and find them
8183092 i really hope not but i think it might cause problems
8183093 we want to provide better space and make the move as seamless as we can
8183094 we get to be a part of it throughout the entire life cycle of the intellectual property
8183095 i want students to come in and tell me what games they want
8183096 if they had more games i would always be here
8183097 air conditioning and a comfy couch that pretty much does it for me
8183098 i discovered this myself about two weeks ago as well and was kind of wondering when i should break the news i wish i had an explanation but i dont theres not all that much more i can say about it theres one other bit of bad news that i discovered at the same time and that is there is no custom controller configuration anymore again i dont really have an explanation
8183099 the main goal is to get better every single day
8183100 they have a goal of giving a 100 percent effort daily
8183101 its been very positive the team has been terrific their learning curve has been quick
8183102 theyre just responding to everything we give them its been a fun thing to have
8183103 chemistry is different we were a little off last year but this year we are close
8183104 i feel like the girls are giving more energy and effort
8183105 with a year like last year everybody wants to turn around
8183106 we knew we were going to be a different team
8183107 we were a little nervous but we adapted to her quickly
8183108 when you have a coach like lauren she expects the best but at the same time tells it how it is
8183109 she doesnt sugarcoat anything and tells us how good we are but where we need to improve
8183110 buchanan is a big campus but this is bigger plus this is college
8183111 its a little intimidating as a freshman coming into a program like this but im willing to step up
8183112 my individual goals this year are to work really hard and learn the new footwork they have here
8183113 not having seniors on the team is probably our biggest challenge
8183114 its a struggle for us having a team thats been together for a couple of years for the most part and not having senior leadership
8183115 as much as i want to improve myself more i have to look at the whole team because this is a team sport
8183116 im not going to win myself im going to win with five girls behind me
8183117 im teaching them to just enjoy the journey and take one step at a time
8183118 they have dealt with a lot of adversity together they just dont want to lose anymore
8183119 its true in london and in the big cities of the north it is connected to the new poverty
8183120 england is one of the richest countries in the world the people im talking about have enormous televisions a lot bigger than my own the latest in mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend their poverty shows in the way they feed themselves
8183121 i felt like the dutch boy at the dyke then an rnli crew arrived after an hour to seal the hole and thankfully the only damage was a swollen finger
8183122 it might not sound big but any hole in a hull will take on a huge amount of water and the boat could have been swamped in minutes so i had no choice but to stick my finger in and work out what the hell to do next luckily i could just about reach my radio to explain my predicament to the coastguard and say i really didnt want to spend the rest of my life there
8183123 sterling remains vulnerable because of perceived imbalances in the economy both in terms of trade and because of consumer debt at a time when credit conditions are tightening and disposable income is falling
8183124 despair is the horrible blankness that settles over us when nothing is seen as precious anymore and there is no capacity to feel it anyway as great as our tragedy may be if we feel it to the full it is a sign that the weapons
8183125 these new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurements because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8183126 the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8183127 we wanted to revitalize it and make it an area people really enjoy coming to
8183128 we really see this as necessary in helping bring the peace garden back to the communitys awareness
8183129 before it was just a lawn with statues in it
8183130 i hope itll have more of a garden y feel to it
8183131 our goal is to give those mounds as much shade as possible

8183133 our job going into tuesday nights game was to try and get within four games of the red sox and get closer to chicago now were six back of the red sox were definitely digging ourselves a big trench to climb out of
8183134 we know we need to play better down the stretch
8183135 we were hoping the last 32 games wed have to play very well and win 22 games now we have 31 games left and have to win 22 still maybe even 23 we have to be really good down the stretch
8183136 a bunch of these teams were playing have given us problems this year
8183137 weve got five more with the red sox six more with
8183138 weve been very good at recovering and coming back the next day
8183139 its sore i got this in 2006 and i couldnt squat this time i can squat
8183140 you play every day and youre going to get your ass kicked sometimes
8183141 it was actually pretty similar the way he held it there are little things that he showed me that kind of helped me out the things he showed me with his grip the way he released it
8183142 its possible we just have to see how he feels after tomorrows bullpen session
8183143 if he comes out all right thats what you talk about with the next step that he needs to see some hitters
8183144 there is time if we feel thats the right thing to do
8183145 the ball skipped up off the grass and i couldnt get a handle on it to throw it
8183146 i couldnt tell what timmons said so i went back to the umpire i didnt know if he called him safe or out
8183147 i knew crisp was flying because i saw him out of the corner of my eye so i just tried to stay back to make sure i could catch it i handled it it was just deep in my glove and i couldnt get it out thats why i was hoping he called him out
8183148 i saw the ball hit to third base and that it was deep and rodriguez was going to throw it over there i thought he might be out but i just kept going
8183149 poutine was long considered junk food but now people are reinterpreting it in new ways its being taken more seriously
8183150 the people of drummondville can try to claim the title of inventors of poutine we wont sue them
8183151 i wish them good luck i dont want to go to war over poutine
8183152 but you have to do unto caesar what is caesars poutine is a very good dish that was created in warwick in 1957
8183153 its not a symbol everyone is proud of its a dish that isnt elegant or chic and is has zero health content
8183154 but its an icon of junk food cuisine quebecs answer to the hot dog

8183184 mujeres asesinas is a first of a kind hd soap opera that was heavily publicized in all types of media across mexico so it was vital that we were able to launch the hd program with the tools we needed to monitor hd video quality effectively and with reliability
8183185 we were thrilled with the performance of wohlers rm 3270w hd monitor which provided an extraordinarily clear picture and on screen level meters that were exceptionally helpful in maintaining the quality of the hd broadcast
8183186 its exciting for us to see companies such as pctv entrust premier hd programming such as mujeres asesinas to our rm series monitoring systems
8183187 the rm 3270w hd and other products in the rm series are a perfect fit for this type of monitoring application as they offer everyday performance convenience and functionality rarely found in similarly priced hd monitoring systems

8183260 relic sees rts on console as a very interesting proposition but so far it hasnt been a good fit for the games we have made
8183261 we dont see porting a traditional pc rts to console as a very good strategy because the controls by definition are incompatible with the game design to do rts on console right you have to develop from the ground up and rethink what it means to have real time strategy gameplay
8183262 dawn of war ii isnt a traditional rts and i think it would make a much better candidate for porting to console than any of our previous games but there are no such plans right now

8183289 i think all of us and obviously i include my own family in this we expect that when we shop that the things we buy or that we eat are going to be safe
8183290 its part of their belief system that this is not the right thing to do

8183300 at the end of the day though these medical emergencies end up causing a large number of delays in total 2 983 minutes of delays annually
8183301 if you think of the yonge line which carries 35 000 people between 7 45 and 8 45 a m running a train every two minutes an eight minute delay is the equivalent of four trains passing by each train carrying somewhere between 1 300 and 1 400 people

8183309 tel aviv court yesterday has rejected taros contention that sun pharma should have conducted a special tender offer under israeli law
8183310 the court stated that the directors should have studied the agreements prior to their being signed and should have confirmed then that they were in the companys best interest
8183311 the court stated that the directors cannot claim now that they suddenly decided a special tender offer is necessary
8183312 it is clear based on yesterdays ruling that the lawsuit by taros independent directors was part of a calculated effort by barry levitt to avoid living up to his obligations under the option agreement
8183313 the trend is certainly good for exporters who at the present level are in a competitive position

8183326 orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
8183327 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
8183328 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out

8183338 i never saw my opponent before that was the tricky part
8183339 i think i have a great appeal to many fans around the world

8183372 vigorous expression of the freedoms that make our society great
8183373 and each generation needs to explore the history of the past to understand fully the context in which these polar extremes come into clashes with one another
8183374 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8183375 and whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8183376 it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8183377 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8183378 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8183379 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever because he thinks americans overall are better off thanks to president bush
8183380 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home
8183381 well in john mccains version theres no place like home and a home and home and home
8183382 over the last eight years your lives are less secure those are the facts and john mccain is not promising to do anything different than george bush did
8183383 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8183384 weve got to start smacking back in short understandable bites
8183385 everybody is nervous as all get out everybody says we ought to be ahead by 10 15 points what the heck is going on
8183386 not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8183387 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8183388 and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8183389 not ready 08 a mile high and an inch deep
8183390 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president of the united states of america
8183391 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all
8183392 candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8183393 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8183394 is being treated as a criminal investigation avalon is aggressively and immediately pursuing answers
8183395 we want to find out whos responsible for this act
8183396 authorities were fortunate to get some clues early in the investigation
8183397 but this wont take them to a specific office or individual like dr jones office in atlantic city
8183398 we cant comment on the source right now thats what were investigating
8183399 i think mayor pagliughi is probably right somebody came by and wanted to get rid of it medical waste
8183400 they knew it was illegal i cant imagine it was a mistake
8183401 i think it was done intentionally and when they find them i hope they stick it to them with a couple of their own needles throw the book at them
8183402 every shore community feels for avalon because someone might want to do it along their shore avalon is a great place with clean beaches
8183403 it could have fallen off a barge but it wouldve had to be really close to the shoreline barges are usually five to seven miles out
8183404 it would have to remain in a container or bag until broken apart by the wave action on the beach
8183405 someone could have taken a hike along the beach and gotten rid of the stuff in the middle of the night
8183406 we are carefully and continually monitoring the avalon beaches during this unfortunate event and will do everything we can to keep the beaches safe and open
8183407 we saw the lights right when we were about to crash
8183408 but there was nothing we could hear the sirens werent on
8183409 everything indicates he was operating in an emergency mode which would mean lights and sirens im not going to say the witness was wrong but at this time i dont have information that refutes it in any way

8183418 they can jerk us around downtown but were not going to let them steal our hope
8183419 my directive is youre going to take one at a time
8183420 lets get this done right before we start to worry about another community id like to claim this success before we move on to the next one
8183421 whats hard to communicate is the hope we got after doing this plan for a year it drives your spirit
8183422 every year that they come in and say were doing this redevelopment plan and then they disappear and never come back again that harms the trust in the neighborhood
8183423 and the problems of bergen square the crime rate and the poverty index will continue to rise
8183424 its a direct result of the judge not understanding how redevelopment works
8183425 its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities

8183432 while the numbers team is crunching data my team and i are focusing on important gaming in indonesia human behavioral patterns and psychological trends including buying patterns the impact of economic recession or boom and governnment mandates
8183433 our gaming in indonesia research division has been able to harness the power of data mining and databasing to better understand to best way forward
8183434 and as a result finding key gaming in indonesia market trends can be easily made through simple algorithms
8183435 this just goes to show that proper research balanced with strict budgeting and investment practices will result in higher profits and corporate growth were excited and our investors are pleased many of them long time gaming in indonesia shareholders have been able to retire on the profits from our stock growth alone
8183436 i think its a win win situation for everyone involved
8183437 and consumers stand to benefit greatly as well in the long run competition will only drive prices down and produce higher quality products
8183438 this is an investment in our future and as such will not yield immediate results we need to look for the return 10 even 15 years down the road
8183439 weve been working on this gaming in indonesia project for 8 months now
8183440 and we have yet to see daylight the finance team is getting ansy because we have spent much more than we have gained
8183441 its not really a race to see who finishes first as much as it is a general goal that we should all get to at some point in the future
8183442 many university scholars are joining the gaming in indonesia bandwagon which has even caught the attention of eura stallones a fortune 500 executive and chief operating officer

8183462 they said they will blow a whistle and the government must go there are five of them along with one adviser
8183463 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again they told the government to go this is impossible

8183499 two wars a warming planet an energy policy that says lets borrow money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us
8183500 how many people look at these things and wonder what the future holds for them their children their country how many
8183501 people always ask me whats your biggest criticism of president bush im sure you all have your own heres mine its not just the policy differences its the fact that this president never tapped into our greatest resources the character and resolve of the american people he never asked us to step up
8183502 think about it after september 11 if there was a call from the president to get us off foreign oil to stop funding the very terrorists who had just attacked us every american would have said how can i do my part
8183503 at a time when american families are struggling to keep their gas tanks full john mccain voted 25 times against renewable energy biofuels solar energy he even voted against wind energy
8183504 a a time when americans should be working even harder on new sources of energy john mccain wants more of the same
8183505 he as taken more than a million from the oil and gas industries he wants to give those oil companies another 4 billion in tax breaks
8183506 four billion in tax breaks thats a lot change but not the change we need
8183507 if you drilled everywhere if you drilled in all john mccains backyards even the ones he doesnt know he has
8183508 there just isnt enough oil in america on land or offshore to meet americas energy needs barack obama understands that the most important barrel of oil is the one you dont use

8183526 i have had representatives of companies from dubai saudi arabia and kuwait on to me
8183527 some of them have phoned the supporters club because they couldnt find the club number so i get the supporters club asking me if the club is for sale so ive got to deal with all that
8183528 we tell them that the club isnt for sale we are looking for new investment it might not be the selling of a stake and weve got five or six options
8183529 i would love to be on the team no matter what but to be on it with a win under my belt would be fantastic
8183530 im ready to win and hopefully it will be this week

8183534 its no great secret that the proposal will involve galway coming into leinster
8183535 ill put it to you this way the request came from ourselves from central level the hdc hurling development committee were given a remit to look at how the thing could be improved
8183536 im well on record as saying that the scenario this year with antrim in particular the way they were accommodated in the championship just wasnt acceptable
8183537 now the scenario will be that well have the munster championship well have the leinster championship which will hopefully incorporate galway and antrim and well be asking the leinster council to facilitate that structure
8183538 if that happens it means its a level playing field for everybody they play in their respective munster and leinster championships then those who are knocked out at the earlier stages come into pool one and those who lose at semi final stage go into pool two so at least we can get a continuity of games at all stages through the summer
8183539 i think it will mean a level playing field for everybody while maintaining the integrity of the provincial championships it also means the galways and antrims of this world will have less reason to be concerned with their set up from here on in
8183540 that will be put before congress in early october im not certain if its going to be the only proposal but that will certainly be the key proposal
8183541 i think were saying this now for the sake of hurling ever since i became involved at central level over 10 years ago ive probably had an involvement every year over some restructuring of hurling or other
8183542 we need to stop chopping and changing we need to give it a chance to bed in and i think it will be the final chance well have to put a decent structure on it
8183543 its not easy munster want to have their competition we have to try and accommodate galways wishes about not being in a province antrim want to retain some involvement in ulster we have to try and give two games to everybody so before you start looking at any system youre working with at least one hand tied behind your back
8183544 its not easy to come up with a system that suits everybody but on this occasion probably for the first time were putting in a system thats coming from central level where were saying this is what we want the hurling championship to be its unlike in the past where we sat down with everybody and tried to rejig to suit their needs

8183557 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain
8183558 as i recall we did it before with president clinton and the democrats
8183559 and president obama and the democrats will do it again
8183560 john mccain promises more of the past america has never been afraid of the future and we shouldnt start now

8183577 its a real different election than it has been in many years i think people see an opportunity to go there and be in power
8183578 i really feel at the end of the day the majority of folks voting will vote for the republican candidate because they best follow their beliefs
8183579 theres never been a time when all the stars are aligned and every race from president to congress to the legislature are all in play weve never seen this before in our history and its very exciting to be a part of
8183580 its unusual and inconsistent for him to be in this area we want someone to tell us what he was doing
8183581 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty if its not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8183582 well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in the space of a few weeks
8183583 what is his agenda nobody has any idea of what is his agenda and he wants me to agree with it on the phone this is a joke
8183584 its clear hes trying to create any reason to rush to an election to hide how much he is ill prepared to face the difficulties of the country this prime minister is panicking inventing reasons to try and trigger an election and breaking his word because he has as you know a fixed election date law to respect
8183585 the public will have to make a judgment on which direction for the country they want to take and who they believe is best equipped to lead the country at this particular time in history with the challenges that are before us
8183586 its not a matter of polls as you know the polls arent particularly wonderful its a matter of my responsibility as prime minister to make a decision on whether i think the fall session of parliament can be productive
8183587 if i dont think it can be productive then obviously its my responsibility to make sure the people of canada can elect a parliament that can proceed
8183588 certainly spending weeks and weeks playing telephone tag with guys to set up the meetings with opposition leaders doesnt help me confirm that things are going to be very productive

8183601 all we know it was a confirmed case of listeriosis that is for the powers at be to find that out
8183602 you dont expect something like that to hit so quickly
8183603 one day she is fine then two days later she is gone this bacteria is just very cruel
8183604 between the telephone calls to our various offices and the people who have contacted us by way of the internet weve already heard from about 500 people
8183605 i wish the number was smaller its an unbelievable tragedy and it should have been avoided
8183606 i wasnt sure why i was sick and then i heard about the outbreak
8183607 and then i went into a panic because in 1981 i had lost my son because of the same bacteria
8183608 we all feel tremendously for all those who have been affected by this terrible development i want to express my condolences to those families that have been affected
8183609 i think all of us and obviously i include my own family in this we expect that when we shop that the things we buy or that we eat are going to be safe
8183610 its all so amazing because a few years ago i was just some opinionated guy who got agitated at dinner parties
8183611 now ive got a floor pass and i find it rather shocking
8183612 we use journalistic tools but we have a definite point of view id say blogs are a hybrid of journalism editorial writing and talk shows
8183613 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches to see another republican in the white house
8183614 if the president isnt exactly on our side call michelle obama and were going to have someone who answers that phone
8183615 hillary is the spark that started the forest fire and were the forest fire
8183616 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8183617 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8183618 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8183619 to my supporters my champions my sisterhood of the travelling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart thank you
8183620 you never gave in you never gave up and together we made history
8183621 she will do what she has to do for the party she is a graceful lady
8183622 as i recall president clinton and the democrats have done it before
8183623 i cant wait to watch barack obama sign a health care plan into law that covers every single american she said
8183624 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y
8183625 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8183626 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8183627 mein erster eindruck beim ersten abmarschieren war dass der kurs gro e hnlichkeit mit dem stra enkurs von montreal hat valencia bot aber unerwartet gro e auslaufzonen und machte insgesamt einen ger umigeren eindruck als montreal
8183628 mit zunehmender rundenzahl w chst auch der datenbestand und die fahrer gewinnen zunehmend an streckenerfahrung
8183629 aus dieser sicht hatten wir einen hervorragenden start ins rennwochenende und konnten beide trainingssitzungen ohne anzeichen f r irgendwelche probleme abwickeln und obwohl wir nach dem ende des vormittagstrainings unser setup noch nicht eingegeben hatten war die balance von timos wagen bereits alles andere als schlecht
8183630 insbesondere tendierte das auto jetzt zu einem leichten bersteuern und das bremsgef hl war nicht so wie jarno es sich gew nscht hatte
8183631 da wir bei timo schon die richtigen einstellungen gefunden hatten beschlossen wir nach der session noch einmal die daten durchzugehen und timos setup auch auf das auto von jarno zu bertragen ber jarnos rang in den zeitenlisten machten wir uns in diesem stadium also keine besonderen gedanken
8183632 auf einer der angriffsrunden verhielt sich sein auto beim heftigen abbremsen in kurve acht kurz vor der br cke nicht wie erwartet und auf einer anderen gab es schwierigkeiten bei ebenfalls starkem bremsen in kurve zw lf nach der langen geraden
8183633 ich bin mir sicher dass wir es in die letzte qualifyingphase geschafft h tten wenn wenigstens eine der beiden schnellen runden problemlos verlaufen w re
8183634 nach ber cksichtigung der relevanten faktoren riefen wir ihn in die garage zur ck bevor er alle qualifying runden beendet hatte um so wenigstens kraftstoff zu sparen
8183635 auf unserer besprechung nach dem qualifying hatten wir eine sehr lebhafte diskussion dar ber welche boxenstrategie zu w hlen w re um in rennen weiter nach vorn zu kommen
8183636 timo wand sich geschickt durch den konfusen verkehr der ersten runde und machte drei positionen gut
8183637 kombination aus jarnos entschlossenheit timos speed und der richtigen teamstrategie
8183638 timo wand sich geschickt durch den konfusen verkehr der ersten runde und machte drei positionen gut bevor er wieder die kontrolllinie erreichte was uns eine reihe neuer strategischer m glichkeiten an die hand gab wir hatten timo mit gen gend sprit f r eine ein stopp strategie ins rennen geschickt waren aber darauf vorbereitet je nach reifenzustand erforderlichenfalls auch einen zweiten boxenstopp durchzuziehen
8183639 jarno hielt seine position beim start und nahm dann den vor ihm liegenden toro rosso von vettel ins visier den er m helos versetzen konnte weil er aus dem qualifying sprit f r zwei runden mehr als die zwei stopp konkurrenten im tank hatte
8183640 dies war das dritte mal in dieser saison dass wir mit beiden autos punkten konnten ich muss aber sagen dass der zweifache punktegewinn auf dem gro en preis von europa wohl in erster linie das resultat einer geschlossenen anstrengung des ganzen teams gewesen ist

8183734 what would really be interesting for people to see is how beautiful things grow out of shit because nobody ever believes that everybody thinks that beethoven had his string quartets completely in his head that it somehow appeared formed in his head and all he had to do was write them down but what would really be a lesson that everyone could learn is that things come out of nothing the tiniest seed in the right situation turns into the most beautiful forest

8183776 a fair return for the public on research funded with taxpayers money
8183777 peer reviewed journals play an irreplaceable role in authenticating articles through registration certification dissemination and editorial improvement
8183778 for our member publishers making access to research articles free at any point after or even upon publication presupposes a means of recovering revenues that allow the journal to exist
8183779 the embargo periods foreseen in the context of the commissions open access pilot six to 12 months after initial publication provide a safeguard for the investment made by scientific publishers
8183780 this approach assumes that an article has little value after its embargo period for the vast majority of journals this is a dangerous and fallacious assumption

8183811 andrew what do you want to be when you grow up
8183812 this week man i would like to be a truly great blogger
8183813 unsere konkurrenz versucht t glich unter verweis auf die nachrichtenlage uns kunden abspenstig zu machen
8183814 ich mache ihnen klar dass das alles blo e spekulationen sind
8183815 wir haben beschlossen dass wir nicht in eine bieterschlacht eintreten
8183816 das sollte der gfk aktie helfen die heftig unter einem m glicherweise zu hohen preis f r tns gelitten hatte
8183817 die entscheidung kommt zwar berraschend aber sie d rfte der aktie helfen die zuletzt durch die ganze diskussion und das gegenangebot von wpp f r tns deutlich unter druck kam
8183818 aus strategischer sicht w re ein zusammenschluss allerdings schon sinnvoll gewesen jetzt k nnten die n rnberger versuchen eine reihe kleinerer wettbewerber zu bernehmen um eine entsprechende gr e zu erreichen
8183819 der markt atmet nun auf derzeit w re auch nicht das umfeld f r gr ere akquisitionen und den aufbau hoher finanzschulden
8183820 zudem ist die aktie im vergleich zu denen von wettbewerbern g nstig bewertet
8183821 es ist nicht sicher ob sich wpp den konkurrenten nun wirklich schnappt wahrscheinlich sollte mit dem gegengebot nur verhindert werden dass sich jemand anderes tns einverleibt
8183822 vielleicht nimmt die gfk in einigen 05 08 2008 aktie im fokus qiagen vorb rslich sehr fest quartalszahlen positiv
8183823 ich gehe davon aus dass die rzte auch an einer l sung interessiert sind auch die krankenkassen
8183824 wir gehen an den verhandlungstisch mit der klaren erwartungshaltung vom neutralen schlichter ein deutlich verbessertes angebot vorgelegt zu bekommen
8183825 im zweiten halbjahr werden wir unsere entwicklung weiter fortsetzen und von unserer bevorzugten stellung einsparungen bei kosten sowie st rkeren position im markt profitieren
8183826 im sure if it was for some kind of independent brand that wasnt as iconic as calvin klein i dont think i would have done it because thats too much of a risk
8183827 but when its calvin klein and its fashion photographer steve meisel shooting you and you get to be a part of this amazing iconic brand and their legacy you just kind of go for it
8183828 i love comfort and ease i think you aussies are great at that
8183829 i like to walk by the store and have something catch my eye and then go in but i dont like to do the whole hour long im not a girl girl in that way
8183830 no va a pagar con la misma moneda al gobierno
8183831 finden sie einen optiker der g nstiger ist als fielmann
8183832 el paciente dirigi entonces su atenci n al enfermero al que propin de manera inmediata varias patadas
8183833 al parecer el mismo paciente ha sido protagonista de anteriores episodios violentos en el centro sanitario
8183834 notasd madre de dios este blog trabaja tanto diariamente que me pierdo 3 4 partes de sus posts nos dirigen a una web d nde nos disponen pdfs con una serie de reglas m tricas imprimibles esto va de perlas pues m s de una vez me he visto llorando por no tener una regla y no poder medir 1 cm pues mira por d nde ya no me ocurrir mas baguette como esta para nuestro teclado y doloridas mu ecas adg fad y tv3 estan desarrollando conjuntamente una nueva plataforma llamada broad cat de referencia para el dise o audiovisual de iberoam rica el portal contar con diversas secciones relacionadas con la disciplina y funcionar como punto de encuentro para los creativos de diferentes pa ses e intereses afines por ahora no tengo aun muy clara su funcionalidad pero ya me he registrado a su mailing pu s tengo curiosidad es una especie de concurso de posters con tam ticas de los grandes problemas sociales la muerte infantil las victimas de guerra y otros 5 otros temas tenemos ademas las 7 galerias para poderlas ver con sus respectivas creaciones growing graphics
8183835 weve unwound all gains since january so after such a fierce move i think technically it suggests the aussie may be due for a bit of consolidation
8183836 theres a long way to go on the us housing correction theres still a huge overhang of inventory and the sales that we are seeing are being generated on much lower prices
8183837 the interest rate differentials are certainly when you look in the big scheme of things are not going to move in the aussies favour any time soon
8183838 the baby is healthy he is breathing on his own mum is jetlagged but stable
8183839 i was wishing to see my wife at the time but all that happened you know very well
8183840 i got the operative end one got the comforting end the breathe breathe breathe end and the other got the looking after the baby end
8183841 she was fortunate enough to have doctors on board the flight
8183842 dad is over the moon and he has rung grandparents back in india to tell them the news

8183849 i have nothing to do with this overturning term limits
8183850 with regard to pakistan presidency that is really very much an internal pakistani matter the pakistani people will have to determine who their next president will be
8183851 the relationship between the united states and pakistan is very important we are engaged in very serious efforts to battle extremism in both pakistan and afghanistan and we look forward to continuing our cooperation with the current government in battling extremism
8183852 has many contacts in the south asian region and the middle east as well he talks to various leaders the secretary and president respect his counsel and you know these are not unusual conversations to have with other leaders
8183853 no our message to pakistan is very clear that they are an important ally we need to work together on a wide range of issues most notably war against extremism
8183854 i was the biggest supporter of the olympics i thought it would calm russia down but the fact they got it emboldened them
8183855 this guy putin thinks that statements dont mean anything and that the west will always blink first but they the russian elite have all their money in the west they get very depressed if they are mistreated in the french ski resort of courchevel
8183856 cameron was very good he really got the value side of it very well
8183857 they want to get rid of this government and undermine georgian independence their aim is to get a normal government subordinate to them it would send a very powerful message
8183858 they the russians have fought a war by proxy with nato its about great russia coming back and confronting the horrible west that humiliated russia
8183859 i never had any personal hatred towards him apparently he did towards me

8183863 he has trouble breathing so he is on a ventilator at the moment and he has a little bleeding from his stomach which is giving us some concern
8183864 but on the other hand considering the ordeal he went through there are no internal injuries and there are no broken bones
8183865 and dont talk about yourself too much thats not sexy
8183866 it marks the 45th anniversary of washington it will be televised and dont worry whenever i speak its prime time
8183867 obama is not a civil rights leader hes a politician
8183868 but weve always had different traditions in our community weve never had one lane
8183869 we only have accidents when people switch lanes without giving the signal if everybody will just stay in their lane we wont have no accidents barack we all stay in our lanes and well meet at the tollbooth
8183870 it would have to be a rather pathetic celebrity who was ticked off because they didnt get a photo with obama
8183871 but her video went way beyond the pale it invites the kind of mccain attacks nobody wants
8183872 my father was a drive in theater manager he had seven kids and barely made a living many actors are from working class families unlike mccain i can count the number of homes one
8183873 the mccain people find the strength and cut it down

8183968 tutto quello che capitato nei giorni passati va nella parte opposta
8183969 tutti ormai in occidente si pongono il problema di mettersi nei panni della russia
8183970 la ragione di stato ci ha reso complici nel dimenticare la cecenia
8183971 oggi la russia torna in una condizione di forza soprattutto per il suo profilo energetico
8183972 partnership interesse anche della russia e che nessuno vuole tornare alla guerra fredda
8183973 costruire una seria e nuova politica di partnership dal punto di vista occidentale con gli usa in primo luogo nella relazione con la russia
8183974 il primo impegno della futura amministrazione americana devessere quello di un lavoro comune
8183975 mettiamoci nei panni russi conclude casini ma anche nei nostri
8183976 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8183977 una scelta non facile ma lunica possibilit per salvare le vite delle persone
8183978 mediatore e pacificatore per il regolamento politico partendo dal riconoscimento dell integrit territoriale della georgia mentre la sua leadership ha scelto unaltra strada
8183979 si tratta di una evidente annessione di quei territori che sono parte della georgia
8183980 una balcanizzazione su base etnica del caucaso un pericolo serio per tutti
8183981 si cambia il criterio della cittadinanza con la base etnica e ci ci deve seriamente preoccupare tutti
8183982 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8183983 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8183984 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8184006 the whole state rallies around nebraska and they take it pretty seriously its really exciting for us
8184007 scoring more points than they do thats what im concerned with
8184008 theyre fairly big and physical up front and theyre well coached so well have our hands full
8184009 theyve got to be level headed and concentrate on the fundamentals
8184010 i thought that was the fastest team ive ever seen even back to those old florida state teams
8184011 this is different because itll be one of the first teams that goes out and just tries to ram it down your throat
8184012 nebraska is one of the great football programs of all time it will be a great experience for us to go down there
8184013 i dont think we will be intimidated because we have a lot of seniors
8184014 the rally has been cancelled based on the request of the authorities in view of infiltration of militants and their attacks on outskirts of the city in which some people were killed
8184015 tv was the natural progression for me after theatre but any actor worth his salt will tell you that theatre is better because you only get one chance every night to get it right
8184016 i did my first production in high school one of christopher van wyks plays flat
8184017 you know i loved that production because it was unusual for us to be allowed to give our input into how we felt the characters should act
8184018 it doesnt mean we added lines it means we were allowed to play a role in the development of the characters
8184019 that production remains my second best your first is always your favourite
8184020 i believe that children need their fathers and in my talks i say that men should start taking their place in the home
8184021 single parent homes make up 42 of south african households and most of those are headed by women

8184023 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8184024 now i missed a few years of the cold war as a guest of one of our adversaries but as i recall the world was deeply divided during the cold war between the side of freedom and the side of tyranny
8184025 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8184026 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8184027 if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright
8184028 its 3 a m and your children are safe and asleep who do you want answering the phone
8184029 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8184030 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
8184031 hillary clinton was right john mccain has no plan to protect our homes or create jobs and that spells even more pain for american families
8184032 they are not going to disperse the crowd we are trying to negotiate
8184033 police will seek the warrants for our arrest today dont panic if we have been arrested others will carry on
8184034 if you want to arrest us come here and arrest us here it is the government who must go
8184035 the pads highly provocative action yesterday was completely uncalled for
8184036 they the pad want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8184037 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
8184038 we cannot revive the nic with a racial tag to operate in a non racial society
8184039 i would feel more at home with a progressive organisation taking up the interests of the people than all of us belonging to the anc we need to have a pressure group to work with the anc not against it
8184040 the pressure group could be similar to other groups that are currently alliance partners of the anc
8184041 this is a matter of grave concern to the united nations
8184042 it is vital that the international and afghan military forces thoroughly review the conduct of this operation in order to prevent a repeat of this tragic incident
8184043 made its choice in the early hours of august 8
8184044 saakashvili chose genocide for resolving his political problems saakashvili has thus killed every hope for peaceful coexistence of ossetians abkhazians and georgians within one country
8184045 this contradicts the basic principles of territorial integrity and is therefore absolutely unacceptable
8184046 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job of hiding it tonight i promise you that
8184047 were going to have to speed all the way home

8184077 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8184078 the united states condemns the decision by the russian president to recognize as independent states the georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
8184079 the territorial integrity and borders of georgia must be respected just as those of russia or any other country russias action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations
8184080 it will also not work it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed it further inflames an already tense situation in the region
8184081 direct violation of numerous u n security council resolutions regarding georgias territorial integrity
8184082 it is internationally recognized that if a people based on all these u n provisions express their will to have an independent existence any other state in the world has the right to recognize this independence whether you like it or not
8184083 my appeal to the free world is to condemn and reject russias dangerous and irrational decision not only for georgias sake but for the sake of preserving the fundamental basis of international law and order
8184084 should be a matter of peaceful negotiations and discussions among the parties
8184085 after the dust settled of the whole budget process were off on a positive optimistic step
8184086 this will be a year well learn a lot but we should be in stable shape
8184087 we have things that we want to work on but we also have to be smart about protecting our players were going to need them for the opener
8184088 you have to be smart but you also have to make sure that you have enough guys to finish the game if a few get banged up
8184089 its a fine edged sword when it comes to getting players ready
8184090 you want to get them in game shape but a sprained ankle here or there and a guy is out for three weeks you have to find the right mix
8184091 theres no question that i dont want to play danny the whole way
8184092 we dont need to just try to run the ball we need to see who can actually do it
8184093 there are going to be guys in there competing for jobs
8184094 we have to make sure that we know who we can trust
8184095 i dont want to sound presumptuous but i think its our tournament to have
8184096 im not saying were going to walk over any team i know all the area teams are getting better
8184097 i think the talent level and the level of play at harper creek has increased
8184098 i dont think lakeview has dropped off at all but i think harper creek has closed the gap a little bit each year
8184099 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8184100 you only get a brief glimpse of sunlight before its cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains
8184101 i would like to test myself in another top league spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8184102 its not only the weather in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel joy
8184103 throughout the week they work hard they only talk to people at lunch then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8184104 the only time to meet friends is at weekends but for football players its the busiest time it was much easier for me to adapt to russia than england in england i had no one to talk to the first month was hard i lived alone in a hotel which i left only for training i thought i would go crazy inside those four walls
8184105 we cannot accept these violations of international law of accords for security and cooperation in and the taking of a territory by the army of a neighboring country
8184106 i hope that didnt happen overnight but there has already been evidence that the armies are pushing away the ossetians who favored georgia and in a certain way yes an ethnic cleansing is taking place
8184107 this is going to get worse and its an extremely dangerous situation

8184125 india s home textile exports are expected to reach us 5 billion by 2010 quality products at competitive prices are among the reasons more buyers are sourcing from india suppliers
8184126 as our buyers look for new quality suppliers from india private sourcing events provide an ideal platform connecting them with a range of pre screened suppliers able to meet their specific standards
8184127 as we increase our sourcing from india we are working with many suppliers for the first time and that increases our risk as suppliers we will meet at private sourcing events have been pre screened this helps us greatly reduce our risk and find quality suppliers with more sourcing options in less time
8184128 we are eager to expand to new markets and we are now focused on producing high end products private sourcing events give us the opportunity to meet the international buyers who are looking for our quality products this is an incredible opportunity for us

8184162 i ts exciting that there are strong centre right leaders across europe now sarkozy merkel who are making the running on things like the environment and economic growth and some of the social policies weve talked about to have a french president who wants to integrate into nato whos pro american who thinks that iran is a problem rather than a country to do business with regardless these are huge breakthroughs but at the same time you have always got to respect the fact that there really are some genuine differences over our attitude towards european defence over our attitude towards the reform of the common agricultural policy
8184163 i think there are certain areas where there are difficult decisions to be made over georgia and ukraine and whether or not they should be full members of nato i think it would be better if we were clear and straightforward and said yes obviously there is still a set of problems in the balkans with serbia very unhappy about the greater independence of kosovo again i think we have to be absolutely clear kosovo could not simply remain part of serbia in the light of everything that has happened that was just not possible the people of kosovo are entitled to independence but that must not mean borders elsewhere in the balkans are reopened
8184164 there is a very strong case for a bigger army and this will sound like a fudge but it isnt meant to be what we need is a defence review based on our national security not on treasury guidelines and that will tell us either that we need to reduce the commitments that we have or we need to increase spending
8184165 ive always described myself as a liberal conservative liberal because we do support the spread of human rights and democracy around the world but conservative because before intervening i think you have to demonstrate a practicality and a scepticism and ask all the difficult questions about the consequences of your involvement blair was too eager to get involved
8184166 a neo con would say to hell with that lets just drop the democracy in from the backm of a plane at 40 000 feet but democracy without the rule of law and without human rights and without a strong civil society doesnt really work the problem in zimbabwe is not that they dont have elections its that all the other bits of civil society have been destroyed
8184167 i ts right that our troops will be there for some time to come indeed for quite a long time if you look at some of the original intentions in afghanistan getting rid of the taliban was obviously the right thing to do
8184168 an increasing trend is bringing cocaine by aircraft instead of by boat into west africa
8184169 then it is taken on by land or ship to europe across some dangerous and difficult terrain

8184174 with communication and cell phones this is where it is difficult to cheat in elections now you are announced at the district level and cell phones go wild so by the time you go to the capital if you have changed the figures they will know and you will be caught out
8184175 internet provides groups in society with means to communicate organize and obtain good information which is not controlled by government but only a tiny percentage of african populations have access to internet
8184176 during the 2006 local government elections in senegal radio sud used reporters and correspondents with cell phones to call in what they saw i remember hearing one reporter describing how a local party boss was illegally taking a ballot box on his truck from the polling station this was reported live as it was happening
8184177 parallel reporting was important in zimbabwe it kept them from coming straight out and reporting a false result
8184178 all of this technology is very important and gives a powerful new tool that cuts the ability for cheating
8184179 the more transparency and the more information that can be circulated outside the hands of government is a good thing but the other side of that is that a lot of misinformation can get out that way also
8184180 it doesnt mean anything unless you have all of the means of verifying the results if you have a ruling authoritarian regime which is determined to cheat they will do it
8184181 africans have been able to organize without technology freedom of association the right to organize autonomous organizations and function freely is more important than access to new technology in fostering democracy
8184182 that said new technology can be a powerful tool in improving communications between citizens and governments between civil society organizations and the public informed citizens are essential to good functioning of democracies
8184183 authoritarian regimes want to control and monopolize the flow of information african authoritarian regimes dont have the power and resources to completely control information disseminated through traditional means as oral communications are still the main means of disseminating information
8184184 new technology is not a panacea but it can speed up processes of democratization and should be encouraged

8184189 currently in jamaica while voice telephony has achieved practical universal access there is relatively low demand for access to data and data related services due to the relatively low level of education this is a major hurdle to the creation of a knowledge based society critical to global competitiveness the ministry of industry technology energy and commerce mitec is collaborating with the ministry of education and youth to implementing the e learning project in grades 7 11 in all approx 165 high schools in jamaica and utilizing information and communication technologies ict to enhance the teaching and learning processes and improve the level of passes in the school leaving examinations

8184211 to face challenges of web 2 0 we need to come up with development 2 0
8184212 web 2 0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move to the internet as platform and an attempt to understand the rules for success on that new platform
8184213 our data capturers receive extensive training from the south african police service
8184214 we see ourselves as an independent conduit between the public and the authorities so that the public can have the greater confidence that they can participate in the fight against crime without any reprisals or disruptions to their daily lives
8184215 if you have any information about criminals be they murderers rapists robbers hijackers burglars drug dealers gangsters child abusers fraudsters smash and grabbers or petty criminals let us know and we will get the police to act
8184216 this is not a forum to whinge about crime or make hoax calls it is aimed at helping the authorities catch criminals
8184217 our campaign breaks the barriers by giving people the opportunity to provide information without directly speaking to the police
8184218 we managed to win the scottburgh to brighton without ever training together
8184219 hank is such a laid back kind of guy and we really get on well which is important in any combination

8184221 paddlers always make mistakes at the low weirs on the first day but you just have aim to keep yourself in your boat

8184224 canon got involved with the breede marathon because paddling is not only a competitive sport but a recreation activity combining exploration adventure wilderness encounter and comradeship
8184225 the breede marathon is the biggest k2 event in the cape with loads of potential and we would want to see the breeder become one of the top three k2 events in south africa

8184228 t echnology now is infused with the ability to speak as a society we are apparently ready to concede what many have feared for more than a decade that entertainment technology has power beyond our control power to nurture or reinforce normative social behaviours power to tell us what to think and do power to shift how neighbours interact with neighbours or mothers care for and protect their children
8184229 we must extend our knowledge to include arenas that had been off limits or at least of limited interest to communication for development practitioners previously gaming social networking personal blogging or text messaging for example if such technology is now interactive moving into the realm of dialogue and debates then why arent we using it more often to do good
8184230 when we need to influence or just understand why people within a defined community do what they do can technology be used to catalyse public and private dialogue

8184247 the tactics come after says the new coach of the nerazzurro which is especially true for the cup
8184248 definitely the most important are the tactics i once said barcelona could not be champion of england and chelsea could not be in spain clearly no
8184249 systems with a few lines of play are more difficult with the triangle every player has a rational occupation of the space and it is easier to handle ball possession
8184250 after three years i admit that the tactical ideas coming out at chelsea is not my true philosophy
8184251 italy is more tactical than elsewhere when i arrived in london chelsea was the only team training to use the 4 3 3 players between the lines wings that change their position during the game today also arsenal and manchester play this way ball possession and working methods have changed regarding the application at lnter well i like to think of using the game with bands to create spaces to seek the depth there it is not said that two wingers must be purchased i like the players that are employed
8184252 often we coaches are not important and usually we play the game first when we take to the field to prepare and after when the ball has stopped

8184297 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8184298 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8184299 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8184300 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8184301 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8184302 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8184303 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8184304 anyone with a bgp router isps large corporations or anyone with space at a carrier hotel could intercept data headed to a target ip address or group of addresses the attack intercepts only traffic headed to target addresses not from them and it cant always vacuum in traffic within a network say from one at amp t customer to another
8184305 kapela said eavesdropping could be thwarted if isps aggressively filtered to allow only authorized peers to draw traffic from their routers and only for specific ip prefixes but filtering is labor intensive
8184306 i always had him in the back of my mind as far as just when id get down and worried about myself id think about what he was doing
8184307 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8184308 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8184309 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8184310 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8184311 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8184312 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8184313 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8184314 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8184315 no one works for someone we all just work together
8184316 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8184317 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8184318 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8184319 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8184320 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8184321 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8184322 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8184323 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8184324 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8184325 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8184326 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8184327 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8184328 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8184329 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8184330 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8184331 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8184332 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8184333 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8184334 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8184335 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8184336 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8184337 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8184338 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8184339 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8184340 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8184341 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8184342 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8184343 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8184344 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8184345 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8184346 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8184347 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8184348 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8184349 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8184350 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8184351 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8184352 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8184353 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8184354 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8184355 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8184356 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8184357 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8184358 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8184359 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8184360 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8184361 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8184362 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8184363 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8184364 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8184365 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8184366 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8184367 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8184368 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8184369 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8184370 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8184371 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8184372 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8184373 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8184374 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8184375 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8184376 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8184377 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8184378 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8184379 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8184380 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8184381 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8184382 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8184383 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

8184388 the law recognizes a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
8184389 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth
8184390 if youre talking about a true threat there has to be some evidence theyre not just talking about it or thinking about it especially in a drug induced state
8184391 i think that its something that at times the media tried to make more of
8184392 weve always watched them as we watch all the other groups
8184393 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out
8184394 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiat nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8184395 a nascondino di che si tratta un gioco spieg la pazzia in cui io mi copro gli occhi e mi metto a contare fino a 1000000 mentre voi vi nascondete quando avr terminato di contare il primo di voi che scopro prender il mio posto per continuare il gioco
8184396 advertising trends have continued to deteriorate over the course of the year and future performance will inevitably be linked to the economies of the uk and to a lesser extent that of the republic of ireland
8184397 in response to the current challenging circumstances we continue to actively manage our cost base to achieve productivity gains and in a manner which will protect the long term prospects of the group we expect to deliver a result reflective of these initiatives and the difficult market conditions
8184398 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8184399 lo so bella credimi lo so come se ti fossi portata via met di me stesso
8184400 no non mi quadrava pi niente pi che altro si trattava di stupidaggini e poi
8184401 non ti importa se sono un mostro se non sono umano
8184402 resta con me per sempre prendi qualunque forma fammi impazzire ma non lasciarmi in questo abisso dove non posso trovarti
8184403 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8184404 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8184405 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8184406 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
8184407 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
8184408 mortgage activity appears to be stabilising although the paltry level of activity is not supportive of a near term pick up in house prices
8184409 few crumbs of comfort can be taken from recent signs that mortgage activity may have finally found a floor amid a backdrop of a stalling economy and expected rises in unemployment
8184410 the shortage of mortgage funding has limited activity across the mortgage market including the buy to let sector which has a significant number of lenders that rely on wholesale funding
8184411 these figures show the extent of uncertainty in the housing market which alistair darling made worse by sending out confused signals over a stamp duty holiday
8184412 many people are putting their lives on hold as a result of labours economic incompetence the chancellor should adopt the conservatives plan to abolish stamp duty for nine out of 10 first time buyers

8184507 students need to give investigating officers the correct information because if they leave out crucial information then we are unable to continue with the investigations
8184508 investigations into the students death will not be taken any further since the post mortem results indicate that the deceased died of natural causes and there was no sign of police involvement in the matter
8184509 nobody has bothered to tell us the cause of my brothers death and we have heard rumours that his heart and liver were swollen
8184510 i find it very strange that my brother suddenly developed breathing problems during the day of the protest and died just as the police were dispersing protesting students there are so many questions that have not been answered

8184516 die argumentation mit fehlenden empfangsger ten ist absurd zum start des farbfernsehens gab es auch kaum entsprechende fernsehger te und in den 90er jahren sind viele sender ins digitale fernsehen eingestiegen obwohl es nur wenige digital receiver gab

8184665 from a open health perspective a population wide perspective the prizewinning move is to vaccinate girls and women before they initiate sexed activity
8184666 you crapper then protect individuals preceding to their existence exposed since the vaccine doesnt have some effect after infection has happened
8184667 for women who have initiated sexed activity cervical cancer display is belike a meliorate clogging measure than vaccination
8184668 however we detected presently after the initial licensure of the gardasil vaccine that there was tremendous fault both in the clinical and the lay community regarding the use of this vaccine among women who were already infected
8184669 each of us has conventional communicative reports of doctors thinking that you crapper goodness an infected woman by vaccinating her
8184670 our results fortify the idea that this vaccine is meant to protect against infections when they occur but it isnt effective at helping country the infection erst it has established itself
8184671 if you are sexually active there is no way for you to know for sure whether or not you have been exposed to these portion carcinogenic strains
8184672 are very common and typically exposure happens fairly presently after the initiation of sexed activity
8184673 thats why the prizewinning contract is to try and get the vaccine administered preceding to sexed debut
8184674 we today have a meliorate understanding of how the treatment entireness by increasing the ratio of tumor killing to immune system suppressing cells
8184675 this suggests techniques for further focusing the immune system to move the cancer with less fallout for connatural tissue
8184676 using a vaccine to make a stronger immune salutation to cancer may enable us to use lower levels of ctla 4 blockers which could turn the rigor of their lateral effects

8184695 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8184696 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8184697 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8184698 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8184699 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

8184702 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8184703 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

8184705 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8184706 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8184707 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8184708 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8184709 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8184710 when a lot of cyclists happen to be in the same place at the same time and decide to cycle the same way together for a while
8184711 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8184712 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8184713 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8184714 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8184715 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8184716 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8184717 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8184718 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8184719 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8184720 when a lot of cyclists happen to be in the same place at the same time and decide to cycle the same way together for a while
8184721 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8184722 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8184723 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8184724 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8184725 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8184726 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8184727 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8184728 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8184729 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8184730 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8184731 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8184732 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8184733 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8184734 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8184735 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8184736 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8184737 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8184738 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8184739 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8184740 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8184741 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8184742 why does your belief that he went to a muslim school have more influence over your vote than the issues
8184743 im not a muslim not that theres anything wrong with that
8184744 anyway if possible you should burn your computer after watching this that is all
8184745 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8184746 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8184747 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8184748 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8184749 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8184750 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8184751 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8184752 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8184753 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8184758 judaism is a religion that assumes people have to keep studying and keep learning
8184759 theres a sense that an ignoramus cant be truly pious
8184760 in new york you dont have to do much you just feel jewish
8184761 if im telling him religion is important i should learn about it
8184762 the sense of being in ever larger groups of people who are jewish and interested in jewish learning is so stimulating

8184767 the male pilot was on his own and we believe under some form of instruction
8184768 the other plane involved was occupied by two males who we believe were also under some form of instruction
8184769 he was on his first solo flight and came quite close to a collision and was forced to do a spiral dive
8184770 he would have been doing circuits which means you are not more than 1 000 feet high and couldnt have had time to do it safely
8184771 i watched the plane fly over and thought it was coming very close to another plane then i saw a third plane and that was the one that it hit the right wing tip hit the tail of the plane that crashed
8184772 i think the attention of the pilot would have been on the first plane that he was getting really close to
8184773 i saw them hit each other it crashed down and went out of sight i heard a bang and smoke went up

8184777 getting involved in other things lets the celebrity show people that they can do more than just say the lines of a movie and it gives them the chance to take pride in having another creative outlet
8184778 why must they be segmented into just one type of art it makes sense that someone who is a singer also knows how to dance
8184779 brad is one of those people with tons of interests who figures why not touch everybody with everything that he does his jewelry his architecture
8184780 celebrities know that when their name and face are attached to something it makes an impact on people when a celebrity has a restaurant for instance even if he has nothing to do with the menu people want to go in anyway so they can say they ate the celebritys food
8184781 these are the spider webs that bind and contain the seat of the soul and your womb is the seed of the universe
8184782 its very concerning that we wager such a large equilibrium of women with ovarian cancer not existence treated up to what we would study a minimal standard for surgery
8184783 people in preceding studies have looked at this on a state by state basis what this study rattling did was look crossways a panoptic geographic atlantic of the u s it gave us a good significance of what is happening in our country
8184784 minorities women who live in low income areas elderly women over 70 and those who live in agricultural areas are significantly less likely to get broad tending compared to those women who dont meet those criteria
8184785 those doctors who did 2 to 10 ovarian cancer surgeries were significantly meliorate than those who did exclusive one
8184786 this is a clear victory for people who want to improve source www
8184787 i have never been digit to give up when an impediment is settled in front of me i am in the fight of my life and im lucky to have the support of my husband ian and many friends and family members
8184788 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8184789 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8184790 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8184791 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

8184796 we are aware that the congressional clock is ticking and we are consulting with other governments particularly governments in the nuclear suppliers group to try to move this process forward as quickly as we can

8184811 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8184812 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8184813 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8184814 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8184815 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8184816 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8184817 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8184818 we expect the government to pull all stops with an expansionary populist budget designed to yield maximum political mileage during this critical period for the government
8184819 the twin overriding objective would be to placate public unhappiness over soaring inflation as well as keep the bn ruling coalition component parties happy and minimise the possibility of further defections to the opposition coalition
8184820 this the budget would also aim to shore up support for the government following the huge fuel price hike in june and the electoral setback earlier this year
8184821 the fiscal deficit was brought down from 5 3 percent of gdp in 2002 to 3 2 percent of gdp in 2007 but it is projected to widen to 3 5 4 0 percent in 2008 09 reflecting largely higher operating and development expenditure
8184822 malaysia is going to tolerate for a couple more years deficit budget spending which has been the case since 1998

8184840 hes very excited to have lacey schwimmer as a partner
8184841 presents a great opportunity for audiences to see gay people included in pop culture in a matter of fact kind of way
8184842 could it be great to see two gay dancers paired on a show like this absolutely we know that there are many competitive gay and lesbian dance pairs out there and that might be something abc and other networks dance shows would want to consider including in the future
8184843 i personally think if you got two hot guys together dancing people will watch
8184844 sometimes you have the odd couple and those can work too

8184894 when there are lots of competing males trying to fertilise the eggs of females males produce larger more competitive sperm that live for longer
8184895 similarly when females detect that there are too many males competing for her eggs too many sperms can kill the eggs of some organisms the females play hard to get producing smaller eggs that are harder for searching sperm to find
8184896 these changes make sense if youre stuck to a rock like sea squirts are if you cant run away from a highly competitive environment you must therefore make your gametes more competitive in order to get a higher chance of successfully reproducing
8184897 we manipulated adult densities in the field by placing either one low density or 15 high density sea squirts in a cage for one month
8184898 this research tells us a little as to how sex evolved in the first place
8184899 specifically it gives us some insight into why sperm are so tiny and males make millions of them whereas female eggs are much larger and are produced in fewer numbers

8184957 deep down in our non violent creed there is a conviction there are some things so dear somethings so precious and some things so entirely try true they are worth dieing for and if a man happens to be 36 years old as i happen to be some great truth stands before the door of his life some great opportunity to stand up for that which is right hes afraid his home will get bombed or hes afraid hell loose his job or he afraid he will get shot if hes bound by state troupers he may go on to live until hes 80 hes just as dead at 36 as he would be at 80 and suasion of freezing in his life is merely the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit he dies a man dies when he refuses to stand up for what is right a man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice a man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is truth but we are gonna stand up right here i dont mind like anybody i would like to live a long life longevity has its place but i m not concerned about that now i just want to do gods will and hes allowed me to go up to the mt and ive looked over and ive seen the promised land i may not get there with you but i want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land so im happy tonight im not worried about anything im not fearing any man mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord

8184963 i refer to the latest ac neilsen global consumer confidence index which found the collapse in consumer confidence in australia has been twice as severe as that in the rest of the world
8184964 when will the prime minister take any responsibility for this dramatic decline in consumer confidence
8184965 why are australians worse off since the election of the rudd government and does the prime minister take any responsibility for it
8184966 i would again challenge those opposite as they contemplate their mission of economic vandalism in the senate to instead join with the government in a strategy of responsible economic management to make sure that we through fiscal policy maintain the integrity of the budget surplus in order to provide australia with a decent economic buffer in the uncertain global economic times that we face
8184967 i would call on the opposition to abandon its short term sniping and mindless populist politics
8184968 it would also perhaps look at the 10 million paid to five brethren schools around australia in january this year those schools have a population combined of just 2 000 students

8185039 if we consider mankind as a whole and substitute it for a single individual we discover that it too has developed delusions which are inaccessible to logical criticism and which contradict reality if in spite of this they the delusions are able to exert an extraordinary power over men investigation leads us to the same explanation as in the case of the single individual they owe their power to the element of historical truth which they have brought up from the repression of the forgotten and primeval past

8185143 recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of eukaryotic genes are mispredicted at the transcript level as the mispred routines are able to detect many of these errors and may aid in their correction we suggest that it may significantly improve the quality of protein sequence data based on gene predictions
8185144 some secreted proteins may truly lack secretory signal peptides since they are subject to leaderless protein secretion similarly it cannot be excluded at present that transchromosomal chimeras can be formed and may have normal physiological functions nevertheless the fact that mispred analyses of protein sequences of the swiss prot database identified very few such exceptions indicates that the rules of mispred are generally valid
8185145 interestingly even the manually curated uniprotkb swiss prot dataset is contaminated with mispredicted or abnormal proteins although to a much lesser extent than uniprotkb trembl or the ensembl or gnomon predicted entries

8185182 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed
8185183 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8185184 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8185185 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8185186 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed
8185187 we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8185188 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations
8185189 the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8185190 our study shows that these views are incorrect and illustrate the potential for the human brain to rapidly and dynamically reorganize itself
8185191 we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight and we believe that these principles may also apply to other sensory loss such as deafness or loss of function following brain injury

8185238 jeg ledsagede sufier og modtog tre typer viden fra dem hvordan man skal tale hvordan man behandler folk med eftergivenhed og et bl dt hjerte og de retledede mig i sufismens veje
8185239 o min s n du skal side med sufismens folk for de er som en kilde til viden og de bevarer ihukommelsen af all h i deres hjerter det er asketer og de har mest af den ndelige kraft
8185240 jeg vidste sandelig at sufier er s gende i all hs vej og deres opf rsel er den bedste opf rsel og deres vej er den bedste vej og deres manerer er de mest helliggjorte de har renset deres hjerter fra andet end all h og de har gjort dem til stier hvor ad floder kan l be modtagende viden om den guddommelige tilstedev relse
8185241 m den hvorp sufier s ger viden er ved at frakoble sig selv fra dette verdslige liv duny og de holder sig travle med dhikrull h ihukommelse af all h hele tiden i alle deres handlinger og i deres opf rsel

8185267 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8185268 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8185269 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8185270 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8185271 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8185272 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8185273 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

8185283 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8185284 exigimos de la autoridad un alto a la represi n
8185285 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8185286 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8185287 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8185319 die entscheidung kommt zwar berraschend aber sie d rfte der aktie helfen die zuletzt durch die ganze diskussion und das gegenangebot von wpp f r tns deutlich unter druck kam
8185320 aus strategischer sicht w re ein zusammenschluss allerdings schon sinnvoll gewesen jetzt k nnten die n rnberger versuchen eine reihe kleinerer wettbewerber zu bernehmen um eine entsprechende gr e zu erreichen
8185321 der markt atmet nun auf derzeit w re auch nicht das umfeld f r gr ere akquisitionen und den aufbau hoher finanzschulden
8185322 zudem ist die aktie im vergleich zu denen von wettbewerbern g nstig bewertet
8185323 es ist nicht sicher ob sich wpp den konkurrenten nun wirklich schnappt wahrscheinlich sollte mit dem gegengebot nur verhindert werden dass sich jemand anderes tns einverleibt

8185347 recorded the concerns and facts on the minds of the shack dwellers when faced with the conduct of the unit
8185348 it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8185349 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8185350 this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together no way no how no mccain
8185351 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8185352 hillary was being a very good party person and shes always been a leader and if this is what she feels and what we need to do that is what well do
8185353 i ran at the state level as a party leader and elected official and i got elected and got the highest number of votes and they were close to 500 plus voters and all these people have asked me if i am going to be representing them i gave them my word
8185354 so in the first ballot i will definitely vote for hillary in spite of the fact that she is going to be releasing us and once obama is our candidate i am going to work on that ticket obama biden all the way
8185355 i agree with hillary that the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8185356 the media always talks about how many new people senator obama brought into the fold this year
8185357 i worked on the campaign i was regional field director and i know how many new people hillary brought into this campaign so both of them need to be given due credit and there are women who have said this is the first time they even got involved and they say mona and monisha brought us into the system and its ironic that me mona i was not even born here
8185358 some of them are changing in the sense that they realize whats at stake
8185359 i am a life long democrat and i have gone through this every single election we have a candidate and then maybe another candidate becomes your nominee but once we have a nominee i am behind the ticket 110 percent

8185379 and president obama and the democrats will do it again
8185380 john mccain promises more of the past america has never been afraid of the future and we shouldnt start now
8185381 we simply cant drill our way to energy independence even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards including the ones he cant even remember
8185382 the biggest blessing in disguise i ever could have wished for
8185383 we wanted to design the perfect basic the new staple for every womans wardrobe
8185384 you have in the two people running for president interestingly two people who represent very different views of how to solve the challenges we face
8185385 on one side with barack obama you have an individual who i believe is a very charming and charismatic celebrity and senator a nominee for the democratic position to become president
8185386 as you stand back and look at joe biden you see someone who has spent 30 years dealing with foreign policy but has usually been wrong
8185387 despite the fact that we differed on issues in every debate i pointed out my respect for him

8185432 for us africa still has a huge amount of promise
8185433 there are still things we want to do with the african setting and i think its safe to say well continue to explore it
8185434 that said we might find something new and compelling about the antarctic setting that wants us to make the next game there but honestly were still at the preliminary stages
8185435 if we wanted to make the next game set in the forest of south america we could do it
8185436 but i think to save time for us one of the reasons we chose to use the african setting is because we felt that in order to retain the far cry brand value of an exotic dangerous environment a place that maybe people havent had a chance to see themselves or have seen extensively in film television and other games we wanted to choose africa

8185446 if we are moving in the direction of a new cold war it will be harder to find a joint solution to problems such as the nuclear conflict with iran
8185447 of course cooperation on the iran issue could fall victim to the current confrontation between the united states and russia but this does not have to be the case
8185448 in past months the u s has moved away from unilateralism on this question and moved towards more multilateralism
8185449 it makes the enforcement of already ratified sanctions against tehran more challenging and significantly reduces the chances of consensus for the imposition of a fourth round of punitive sanctions against our nation
8185450 the downward spiral in relations between russia and the west will make it harder to work together on anything and iran policy heads the list of areas that are going to suffer
8185451 finding consensus on additional security council sanctions was hard to begin with
8185452 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
8185453 does not see an action against iran as the right thing to do at the moment
8185454 it will not become easier to lead a third war in the middle east just because one now also faces a conflict with russia
8185455 its no use denying theres a huge amount of tension in the relationship following the georgia intervention but there will be a lot of determination to keep the iran show on the road
8185456 everyone believes russia will no longer join u s pressure on iran
8185457 hostility to the war at home in the middle east and elsewhere in the world has had negative effects on the u s image and ability to galvanize the international community on any issue be it the iranian threat or even support for georgia
8185458 russia now has fewer reasons to cooperate with washington regarding irans nuclear program

8185535 he very effectively utilized the internet to get his name in front of mass
8185536 candidates are using all of these new technologies whether it be throwing videos on the internet or text messages to get messages out very quickly so we are seeing a campaign that is different than any other campaign in americas history
8185537 he very effectively utilized the internet to get his name in front of massive amounts of people which again in the presidential race is what you need to do

8185663 it was great good waves and different open race course nice to get a shifty race course we took a few boats on the first run of the first race and ross did some nice work on the second beat and in the second race we managed to come away with a third so we are pleased with that it was shifty and pretty puffy and so it was really nice racing and the forecast is for even more tomorrow and so it might even be a bit like marseille one of the things today was there was opportunities on both sides of the race course and then the nice thing is when you do get a bit of an opportunity to mix it up it works it was really good for us we are slowly getting more and more out of this boat but we are certainly not as quick as the newer boats in that breeze our speed is ok but not as good as the newer boats
8185664 it was a disappointing first race we had a great work up the first beat and rounded the top mark in the lead we set our spinnaker and then the spinnaker sheet got wrapped around the coaming in the back of the boat and started sawing through the back of the boat a little bit of a worry our eight or nine boat length lead went down to zero and from there we were passed by all but again the guys did some great work on the last run and we got back into fifth in the second race we got the end of the line we wanted but i didnt do such a good last wrap up but if today is anything to go by it is going to be full on this week and some awesome racing expected its a good feeling to get started again the race committee did some great work out there holding the marks because these conditions are pretty tough on everybody
8185665 nobody is used to these kinds of conditions you get the feeling you are in the middle of the sea rather than in a bay or gulf or some kind of protected area like in marseille cagliari or palma the shape of the coastline coupled with a north easterly wind on a race course set quite far from the shore means that you have a more open water effect and with big seas the wind does its own thing which leaves tactics wide open what most impressed me today was coming back from a 12th on the first beat to a 3rd on the following run after choosing the right downwind along with ono and cxg which put the three of us in the lead at the gate there are a lot more options than in a normal bay and that makes the competition fantastic
8185666 it was a good start to the week since we didnt sail brilliantly and made quite a lot of mistakes and even then got some decent results it has been a while since we sailed with this kind of wind and there were a few errors as well as my starts not being too good either i am going to have to read the manuals again but if we can get it all straightened we will be feeling confident
8185667 the boat is going well and we still have quite a few new sails both for here and portimao we have run our programme well so we still have some good material to use the race course is tough and the depth and shifts makes it very hard for the committee to lay the marks something we have to keep an eye on especially at the start as they move around quite a lot
8185668 it was very tricky out there big wind and waves and although the breeze was up it was very shifty normally when the wind is up it doesnt move around so much but with the two winds and big mountains inland it makes it very hard to fathom out we felt quite confused at times but we have come away with a couple of good results so as an opener thats not bad
8185669 thierry peponnet and i are a new partnership i havent worked with him before but im really enjoying it of course every one works in a different way and that takes some time to fit in individually it is an on going battle to keep in the top three and look at results overall and not just this regatta

8185671 the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8185672 it was a u s proposal for the date which is 2015 and an iraqi one which is 2010 then we agreed to make it 2011 iraq has the right if necessary to extend the presence of these troops
8185673 this is the kind of music that we want to be associated with
8185674 fond memory of the 80s that soothes our current state of musical confusion
8185675 okay weve gotta play the game do you put your foot on the line here or there
8185676 you know what were not gonna let this thing come out until its right until we know that its good and were proud of it
8185677 i did what i was supposed to do and i followed what was in my heart and my gut
8185678 wow this doesnt sound as good as it used to because i had a disappointing experience with meeting someone
8185679 holey moley thats what theyre doing when they play and thats the way they look with the way they articulate
8185680 we realise that it takes a cold blooded pragmatic and realist viewpoint to enact the changes which will be necessary to achieve our goals
8185681 more than ever the sat reflects the face of education in this country
8185682 you only had the best of the best taking the test
8185683 it is a victory for thousands bringing overwhelming relief to desperate people across the country finally the torment faced by elderly people forced to either spend their life savings on private treatment or go blind is over
8185684 that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings
8185685 amd results in reduced quality of life and increased risks of
8185686 in the face of this inevitable withdrawal what can we do to foster political reconciliation in
8185687 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
8185688 the us may be reaping some of the consequences of exaggerating the real progress in iraqi security forces

8185695 mit der integration der fernseh flatrate in die alice produkte entspricht alice den bed rfnissen des kunden und wird so ma geblich an dem wachstum dieses marktes partizipieren
8185696 damit schaffen wir ein weiteres starkes verkaufsargument f r alice und seine produkte mehr leistung zum gleichen preis
8185697 ich gehe davon aus dass die rzte auch an einer l sung interessiert sind auch die krankenkassen

8185703 wir haben beschlossen dass wir nicht in eine bieterschlacht eintreten
8185704 das sollte der gfk aktie helfen die heftig unter einem m glicherweise zu hohen preis f r tns gelitten hatte
8185705 die entscheidung kommt zwar berraschend aber sie d rfte der aktie helfen die zuletzt durch die ganze diskussion und das gegenangebot von wpp f r tns deutlich unter druck kam
8185706 aus strategischer sicht w re ein zusammenschluss allerdings schon sinnvoll gewesen jetzt k nnten die n rnberger versuchen eine reihe kleinerer wettbewerber zu bernehmen um eine entsprechende gr e zu erreichen
8185707 der markt atmet nun auf derzeit w re auch nicht das umfeld f r gr ere akquisitionen und den aufbau hoher finanzschulden
8185708 zudem ist die aktie im vergleich zu denen von wettbewerbern g nstig bewertet
8185709 es ist nicht sicher ob sich wpp den konkurrenten nun wirklich schnappt wahrscheinlich sollte mit dem gegengebot nur verhindert werden dass sich jemand anderes tns einverleibt
8185710 vielleicht nimmt die gfk in einigen jahren nochmal einen anlauf die beiden unternehmen w rden schon gut zusammenpassen

8185721 youre asking an awful lot of high school guidance counselors because the parents arent there to help students
8185722 when language is a factor it becomes extra challenging to meet the high standards
8185723 we really want to be culturally responsive in our teaching
8185724 they are not going to disperse the crowd we are trying to negotiate
8185725 if you want to arrest us come here and arrest us here it is the government who must go
8185726 they the pad want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8185727 they have broken the law and it could be a serious setback for them
8185728 the government has a lot of options they have time on their side
8185729 it is just one year but it does suggest that womens efforts to get more education and to be even more committed to employment may be paying off
8185730 in silicon valley youve got that technology aspect but its still a male dominated field
8185731 its changing but its going to take time there are more women graduates now but they are young women and they are just entering the workforce i think within five years things will be very different
8185732 were concerned that the data were seeing today reflect a high water mark
8185733 the indicators for 2008 suggest that a year from now the income and poverty data will be much grimmer for california
8185734 people earning low amounts for doing housekeeping or landscaping or for busing dishes they might not live in the city of san jose because its a high cost area
8185735 we know the economy has continued to grow with jobs at the top and at the bottom
8185736 where were weak is in the middle thats one reason why were excited about the opportunity with tesla
8185737 whats closing the gap is mens relatively flat earnings over time and womens rising earnings
8185738 mens earnings now are really no different than they were in the early 70s in real terms
8185739 listening to her i thought she could be president of the united states
8185740 it was like saying goodbye to her someday id like to thank her in person
8185741 is a role model for all women they can do whatever they want to do
8185742 it was a u s proposal for the date which is 2015 and an iraqi one which is 2010 then we agreed to make it 2011 iraq has the right if necessary to extend the presence of these troops
8185743 one or 2 is always pretty much the same thing
8185744 the change i feel is fans are really supporting me and telling me im still no 1 and still the best
8185745 i never saw my opponent before that was the tricky part
8185746 i think i have a great appeal to many fans around the world
8185747 maybe because i speak so many different languages and im so international i have a bit of an advantage im not sure
8185748 i thought the other guy played good for the pressure he was under
8185749 i went on a great roll the only thing i look back on that was a little bit unfortunate was that i was not able to stay ahead with the break in the third set
8185750 i have to start from the bottom but thats ok
8185751 we had a good conversation about the cubs and the sox
8185752 during the periods when the speaker and i are working in a productive way
8185753 i ask him a lot about what it is like raising his kids in this environment because he has a lot more experience at it than i do we have something like that in common
8185754 if we really and truly want to support barack obama and the things his campaign stands for and we want to make his life a little bit easier when he is president why not get our public works program done and put people to work and why not expand health care for families
8185755 why not make it so that the mess barack has to clean up only has to do with 49 states instead of 50 we can actually get a lot of stuff done now in illinois before the people make there decision in november it is consistent with the things senator obamas campaign is about
8185756 my friends joked that i spend so much time talking about this man i should be getting paid
8185757 at the top of his agenda is meeting with leaders of other countries
8185758 he knows how to listen and i can picture mr obama taking that skill to syria pakistan and the middle east and sitting down with them and trying to find a place where we can find common ground and let that be the place to start
8185759 im jewish and im very comfortable with him in terms of israel
8185760 im absolutely thrilled hell bring balance and energy to the ticket
8185761 we want to do a thorough analysis before we bring it back up
8185762 right now it is not critical to bring the atlanta system back up
8185763 we are doing just fine with just salt lake city
8185764 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
8185765 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
8185766 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
8185767 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
8185768 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
8185769 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
8185770 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
8185771 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
8185772 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8185773 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8185774 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8185775 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8185776 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs

8185779 over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8185780 we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8185781 the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8185782 what the speaker had to say about theologians and their positions regarding abortion was not only misinformed it was also and especially utterly incredible in this day and age
8185783 we are blessed in the 21st century with crystal clear photographs and action films of the living realities within their pregnant mothers
8185784 no one with the slightest measure of integrity or honor could fail to know what these marvelous beings manifestly clearly and obviously are as they smile and wave into the world outside the womb
8185785 were delighted the governor has seen the situation as we do and as needing to be resolved by a public hearing
8185786 we intend to present evidence that proves the mayor did not misuse public funds for personal gain and that there was no failure to appropriately inform city council about the facts of the court ordered settlement
8185787 the governor is the sole tribunal in removal proceedings with no right of appeal or review afforded the accused if the governor acts within the law the governors decision is final
8185788 we consider bojan our player he feels spanish he is a tremendous kid and we count on him
8185789 i would love to be on the team no matter what but to be on it with a win under my belt would be fantastic
8185790 im ready to win and hopefully it will be this week
8185791 ive thought about the ryder cup for years but i dont think i can imagine what it would be like
8185792 i know theres been some conjecture about whether hes going to be captaining ireland but i would imagine hes going to be captain of ireland
8185793 for him it will mean not having as much responsibility all the time and i dont see the point in him having all the responsibility here and then all the responsibility with ireland as well
8185794 i think for him its an opportunity to concentrate on his game number one without worrying about the whole team too and also i think hes going to be the national captain as well
8185795 he himself and i agree with him think its an opportunity for him to focus on the quality he can produce in both of those arenas i dont want to ask him to do too much
8185796 he captained leinster a few times when brian was injured last year
8185797 hes got a lot of respect among the players hes got good delegation skills as well and hes obviously got aspirations higher up the chain himself so its a matter of managing him
8185798 it was clear that the day after the fa cup final the manager told me club x wants you tomorrow
8185799 i told them no i dont want to go i love it here i want to stay
8185800 that is the moment i regret after that day after that final i should have left chelsea i would have had the chance to say goodbye to the fans and english football at wembley and thats the moment i regret the next season it lasted only a couple of months
8185801 i have only friends at chelsea i have no problems with anyone at the club i love the club and am in the history of the club
8185802 thaksin is happy to sell off a chunk but wants to retain the majority
8185803 but they potential investors want all of it everybody wants all of it they all want a football club
8185804 i have had representatives of companies from dubai saudi arabia and kuwait on to me
8185805 some of them have phoned the supporters club because they couldnt find the club number so i get the supporters club asking me if the club is for sale so ive got to deal with all that
8185806 we tell them that the club isnt for sale we are looking for new investment it might not be the selling of a stake and weve got five or six options
8185807 its no great secret that the proposal will involve galway coming into leinster
8185808 ill put it to you this way the request came from ourselves from central level the hdc hurling development committee were given a remit to look at how the thing could be improved
8185809 im well on record as saying that the scenario this year with antrim in particular the way they were accommodated in the championship just wasnt acceptable
8185810 now the scenario will be that well have the munster championship well have the leinster championship which will hopefully incorporate galway and antrim and well be asking the leinster council to facilitate that structure
8185811 if that happens it means its a level playing field for everybody they play in their respective munster and leinster championships then those who are knocked out at the earlier stages come into pool one and those who lose at semi final stage go into pool two so at least we can get a continuity of games at all stages through the summer
8185812 i think it will mean a level playing field for everybody while maintaining the integrity of the provincial championships it also means the galways and antrims of this world will have less reason to be concerned with their set up from here on in
8185813 that will be put before congress in early october im not certain if its going to be the only proposal but that will certainly be the key proposal
8185814 i think were saying this now for the sake of hurling ever since i became involved at central level over 10 years ago ive probably had an involvement every year over some restructuring of hurling or other
8185815 we need to stop chopping and changing we need to give it a chance to bed in and i think it will be the final chance well have to put a decent structure on it
8185816 its not easy munster want to have their competition we have to try and accommodate galways wishes about not being in a province antrim want to retain some involvement in ulster we have to try and give two games to everybody so before you start looking at any system youre working with at least one hand tied behind your back
8185817 its not easy to come up with a system that suits everybody but on this occasion probably for the first time were putting in a system thats coming from central level where were saying this is what we want the hurling championship to be its unlike in the past where we sat down with everybody and tried to rejig to suit their needs
8185818 manager paul ince made a holding midfielder a priority almost from day one and were delighted to have finally signed vince
8185819 i think english football at the moment has taken over its improved so much
8185820 we looked organised in the first half but it all went out of the window in the second half we lost our shape and discipline and goalkeeper matt duke kept us in it
8185821 as a collective the team was far too disorganised and dishevelled in the second half and we lost the game
8185822 if you want to be healthy you have to pay for it
8185823 weve unwound all gains since january so after such a fierce move i think technically it suggests the aussie may be due for a bit of consolidation
8185824 theres a long way to go on the us housing correction theres still a huge overhang of inventory and the sales that we are seeing are being generated on much lower prices
8185825 the interest rate differentials are certainly when you look in the big scheme of things are not going to move in the aussies favour any time soon

8185833 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains
8185834 in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8185835 its not only the weather that im not happy about here
8185836 in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel the joy of life

8185841 in the old days we believed mr or mrs right would show up someday but as we remain single for much longer and are far more mobile the chances are more remote
8185842 single men are concentrated in rural and remote communities whereas single women prefer the city and lifestyle towns
8185843 a generation ago women were more likely to remain in rural communities
8185844 there are man dams little isolated reservoirs of men in suburbs across australia where for some odd reason there are more single men than single women and you find a lot of them in rural communities
8185845 if you find yourself in the wrong town then why not relocate to the right town where you are in the market
8185846 you find this right across australia little reservoirs of untapped men

8185891 sputtered strain gauge manufacturers sputter deposit a layer of glass onto the diaphragm sputtered strain gauge sensors actually from a molecular bond
8185892 gauge pressure is measured relative to ambient atmospheric pressure as shown in figure 3 similar to absolute pressure the abbreviations pag pascals gauge or psia pounds per square inch gauge are use to describe gauge pressure
8185893 a classic example of overloading a pressure sensor is known as the water hammer phenomenon this occurs when a fast moving fluid is suddenly stopped by the closing of a valve the fluid has momentum that is suddenly arrested which causes a minute stretching of the vessel in which the fluid is constrained this stretching generates a pressure spike that can damage a pressure sensor
8185894 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data

8185948 you know i think if i were edwards i might give up a haircut or two and refund at least you know the people that gave the 50 or 100 200 items because if they had known the facts they wouldnt have sent him the money and he was the guy that didnt give them the facts
8185949 i mean he knew that in effect he would not be elected president
8185950 ive seen a lot of class action suits with less to it than this particular case
8185951 the facts are clear he solicited money and he wasnt telling the truth to people he was soliciting it from
8185952 i would have to think that a bumper sticker that said obama the other edwards might have been a bit difficult
8185953 same fun loving nonchalant 23 year old i was when i started working for the senator in 2006
8185954 but when you spend this much time you definitely build a bond hes kind of like a big brother to me
8185955 i let out sort of a yell of excitement to be back home
8185956 i think it fundraising success is really about senator obamas message and how inspiring he is to millions of people
8185957 she is answering to a lot of people its a lot of hours its a crazy job
8185958 im going to the convention because i want to see hillary
8185959 i want to be inspired by her encouraged by her to do whats going to be the best thing for all of our futures shes trying to help us all get through this
8185960 i dont think that senator obama understands how deep this commitment goes to hillary and where this passion comes from
8185961 im also a very very devoted democrat so this is a very hard situation john mccain is unacceptable
8185962 any time we can get our side of the story out

8185975 of u tijdens de voorverkiezingen nu voor mij of voor barack obama heeft gekozen doet er niet toe
8185976 het is tijd voor eenheid met n enkel doel barack obama is mijn kandidaat en hij moet onze president worden
8185977 we willen geen john mccain als president als obama in het witte huis zit zal hij onze economie tot leven brengen hij zal de amerikaanse werknemers verdedigen en de wereldwijde uitdagingen van onze tijd aangaan
8185978 de democraten weten hoe je zoiets doet ik weet nog hoe president clinton en de vroegere democraten dat in het verleden hebben gedaan en obama zal dat opnieuw doen
8185979 wie gisteren de speech van michelle heeft gehoord weet dat ze een fantastische first lady zal zijn joe biden is een solide leider en een goed mens
8185980 i really dont want to talk about it but im back out there practicing i feel good and im ready to play thursday
8185981 because i missed so much time i played only in that one game i think i got of to a fairly decent start
8185982 now its just a matter of maintaining that level of consistency i definitely want to get out there and pick up where i left off from that first game
8185983 i think we probably have one of the deepest backfields in the league with laurence youve got kev and myself and sammy its a pretty crowded backfield
8185984 but in todays nfl you want to make sure that you have a deep backfield i think the thing about us is that we all bring something different to the table which gives the defense a different look and which at the end of the day is ultimately to pick this team up
8185985 i think that playbook wise im right where i want to be
8185986 there are still a few things that i need to make sure i freshen up on
8185987 im just thinking about getting out there and making sure that i put myself in the best possession to be successful thursday night
8185988 i dont think that the players at the same position are necessarily in competition with each other
8185989 they could be but they are also in competition for roster spots with other players on the team and possibly on the other side of the ball we want to keep the best players and that may be a balanced roster or not it may include a few more players at one position and a few less at another
8185990 i said it from day one im trying to make this ballclub
8185991 once they make the final cuts hopefully im here and once that happens its just a matter of getting out there and playing football again
8185992 i know the backfield is crowded but ive also said that i know what im capable of doing unfortunately i had the setback with the injury this past week now but once they make the decision of what they want to do its up to me to make sure that come sundays im at my best
8185993 while important members of the business community and the seiu participated in good faith discussions it was unfortunately not possible to achieve a compromise acceptable to a sufficient portion of the business community and the proponents to cause its removal from the ballot

8186004 we see this a unique opportunity for the movie and causal game audiences to cross over and cross promote to each other

8186006 whether a senior administration official serving as point person for northern ireland would be most effective
8186007 i had been on the news condemning the attacks on police officers
8186008 there is no doubt in my mind that it was specifically me who was attacked and targeted because they waited until i had walked away until i came under attack
8186009 once again the police have come under attack on a number of fronts and it is fortunate that no one has been injured during this violence this latest gun attack is another sinister development
8186010 this was a despicable attack and it is fortunate that dolores escaped without serious injury this attack on a public representative working on behalf of the local community must be condemned in the strongest possible terms and i would call on anyone with information on any of these incidents to provide it to the police
8186011 there have been a number of hijackings and attacks on both psni and local residents in the craigavon area
8186012 there have been unconfirmed reports of a number of shots being fired the people behind these incidents are anti social and anti community
8186013 if any of the republican micro groups are part of any of these incidents then they should publicly accept responsibility and explain how hijacking local peoples cars and disrupting everyday life in the community advances one iota the goal of irish reunification
8186014 i would call on those behind these incidents in craigavon to reflect on the damage caused to the local area by their actions and desist from should activity in the future
8186015 it is disgraceful it seems there are those within republicanism whatever strain who are hell bent on shedding the blood of police officers
8186016 to lure the police officers into that area to get a go at them

8186020 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed
8186021 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8186022 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8186023 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8186024 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed
8186025 we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8186026 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations
8186027 the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8186028 our study shows that these views are incorrect and illustrate the potential for the human brain to rapidly and dynamically reorganize itself
8186029 we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight and we believe that these principles may also apply to other sensory loss such as deafness or loss of function following brain injury
8186030 this study highlights the need for congress to revisit the waydietary supplements are regulated in the us our first priority must be the safety of the public herbs and supplements with high levels of lead mercury and arsenic should not be available for sale on the internet or elsewhere
8186031 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
8186032 the medicines which are supposed to cure sickness should not promote another illness due to the presence of toxic materials such as lead
8186033 strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements
8186034 because of the possibilities of objections that are not necessarily based on the issues of efficacy and safety and quality the minister may then be allowed to establish a committee that shall consider these objections
8186035 the da is appalled by the health committees decision after what seems to have been an instruction from health minister manto tshabalala msimang to effectively reinstate a two tier system for approval of medicines
8186036 an appeal process has now been created whereby anyone will be able to appeal against a scientific decision made by the authority on political grounds
8186037 all the studies had undergone scientific scrutiny and had all the required regulatory and ethical approvals
8186038 there was no question of targeting any socioeconomic group selectively
8186039 it is far and away the most common form of cancer
8186040 people with a personal history of non melanoma skin cancer were two times more likely to develop a subsequent cancer compared to people without a personal history of non melanoma skin cancer
8186041 the results were pretty clear in showing the earlier the age of developing non melanoma skin cancer the higher the increased risk for subsequent malignancies
8186042 if they are less adept at that their risk for skin cancer increases
8186043 theyre all down at the convention center theyll be up later watch out for the horse from cheyenne hes mean
8186044 this stuff weighs about 60 pounds you wanna carry it for me the gun shoots sponge rounds theyre like nerf bullets
8186045 i feel like everything in my life depends on physical conditioning
8186046 certainly the kind of activity that i was told about before was something that i approved of that is the community getting out there and helping people to know what the contact numbers are to report information to the police so that we can act on it and take positive action
8186047 but challenging people on their doorsteps is not acceptable and is not something that greater manchester police approves of
8186048 i just wish the police did more drug dealers are still operating in this area
8186049 in order to have the streets clean for our kids then we as parents need to do something about it
8186050 we go on every street every main road and every corner looking out for dealers and prostitutes
8186051 there is no violence but we will explain to them that we will not tolerate them killing our innocent brothers and sisters
8186052 one of our patients in the waiting room noticed another patient waiting for treatment was carrying a gun openly she was concerned about her safety and the safety of those around her and she alerted staff staff put the patient into an isolation space and evacuated departments around him
8186053 staff felt there was a risk to everyone in the immediate area something like this has not happened in my memory i have been at this department for 18 or 19 years and working in a amp e as a job for 25 30 years i do not remember ever having to evacuate for the safety of patients
8186054 the difficulty is we are trying to run a hospital it would be easy to restrict access but we have got to have open doors
8186055 staff deal with a lot of stress and strain during normal times but to add to this the possibility of an armed attacker coming in just makes this completely unacceptable
8186056 at approximately 8 45pm last night police received a report from staff at a hospital in londonderry that one of the attending patients may be in possession of a gun police arrived and one man was arrested in a amp e a bb gun was also recovered the man remains in custody at this time
8186057 ive seen a preview of the collections and it seems belfast fashionweek is bang on trend for autumn
8186058 the shows will bring together a mix of sexy tailoring checks and plaids luxurious lace and a whole host of this seasons must have footwear
8186059 we have such a wealth of talent across the island of ireland in terms of design and retail excellence
8186060 so its time to embrace that and celebrate what weve got especially in the face of the credit crunch
8186061 it is true to say it is dependent on carzola being signed but that is looking very positive at this time he wants to go to real madrid and robinho wants to come to chelsea and i think it will now happen although things can change very quickly
8186062 now i have returned home we will not look back anymore but forwards
8186063 i will give anything to score immediately i want to start again i hope that the injuries i had in recent seasons wont be repeated but here i have everything i need to do well and it depends only on me
8186064 i always felt really good whenever that match happened i hope that it can still be like that
8186065 i would like to thank chelsea football club for all the support you gave me during my tim1e at the club
8186066 i would also like to express my gratitude to roman abramovich for all his help and encouragement
8186067 i am very frustrated the investigation is not as advanced as i had hoped but i am extremely frustrated at the way the victims are being treated by the attorney general
8186068 he the attorney general tried to reprimand me for speaking out when two suspects were released without charge
8186069 the victims were ringing up and giving the victims liaison people a very hard time
8186070 i put a press release out to show it was not our position and try to recover some of the creditability i felt we had lost with the victims
8186071 the attorney general took exception to that and tried to reprimand me i was so angry
8186072 the attorney general and his office are scaring off witnesses the attorney general can be in no doubt that the victims in this case hold him in contempt i am not saying i do but the victims do
8186073 the job is not completely over it could finish in six months or it could take another two years but the investigation being carried out by jersey and uk police officers is first class and they will continue fighting for justice for the victims i am glad to be retired it has been difficult at times in jersey but i am also very sad at leaving behind the people i was working with
8186074 in the days before my retirement i was getting a huge number of messages from victims and members of the public
8186075 throughout this investigation i have had people pleading with me to keep on talking out and telling the truth
8186076 in fact i got a letter this morning from a man who lived on the island all his life and he said what a pleasure it was to see a truly professional police officer not being influenced by politicians in jersey like so many had before
8186077 i have had dozens of people approach me in the street as well
8186078 i recently went to a game at old trafford and outside at the turnstile someone tapped me on the shoulder and said you dont know me but i am from jersey and he shook my hand and wished me a long and healthy life
8186079 this sort of thing makes all the hassle and grief worthwhile
8186080 im not trying to teach men how to be a pick up artist or a stud i want to show men how to build self esteem build a life for themselves which in turn will attract women
8186081 aussie guys have fallen through the cracks we like to think of australian men as bold and confident and a lot of them arent
8186082 the biggest thing is not to look cool but to have a life with lots of interests become involved in your life look after yourself and youre primed to meet someone
8186083 be a gentleman respect yourself even if youre funny and charming youre not going to get far with a woman if you smell
8186084 it will be a means of communication in the gay community as well as with the romanian public as a whole

8186091 it is unfortunate that a major film studio would choose to exploit an ethnic slur as a sensational promotion for a movie mainstreaming a bigoted term in this manner will only serve to legitimize and normalize anti muslim prejudice in our society
8186092 here we go again those crazy muslims always yelling and pumping their fists over something
8186093 ci sono grosse possibilita che laffare si chiuda prima del prossimo week end
8186094 this graffiti needs to be removed immediately it has no place in our city or society
8186095 while progress has been made in recent years sectarianism racism and intolerance are still too evident they mar our reputation blight our economic prospects and have a corrosive effect on our society
8186096 there is clearly a huge job of work to be done if we are to successfully challenge many of the negative attitudes which exist to difference and diversity in our society which go far beyond graffiti
8186097 i believe the circumstances for using tasers should be the same as for lethal weapons
8186098 i have spoken to the person and to his mother and am trying to contact the partner
8186099 the use of tasers mirrors an internationally established pattern where they are often targeted at the vulnerable and those suffering from mental health illnesses
8186100 it was reported that a man had locked himself in a house along with his two young children
8186101 a taser unit was discharged by specialist firearms officers during the incident as an appropriate and proportionate tactical option to bring the matter to a safe conclusion
8186102 at around 6 50am one 37 year old man was arrested and was subsequently detained under the mental health act
8186103 the local celtic supporters club in new york had gotten in contact with me earlier and have very much taken alan under their wing he wanted to see the celtic game and went on down to the pub the people in the bar were well aware of alans story and couldnt believe he was sitting there with them rod stewart was also in watching the celtic game in new york and thats how they met
8186104 i have been talking to alans mother bernie and the operation went well the surgeon dr rose is very happy with how it went
8186105 alan will now spend a couple of days in hospital before they are expected to release him
8186106 alan has met the celtic players gone on the late late show been round to all the fundraising events radio tv interviews met the taoiseach not to mention all the operations
8186107 now it is time the family got a bit of normality back and alan needs that himself he has always said he just wants to be normal and for people to start staring at him for the right reasons and that will happen now
8186108 i am due to go home two or three weeks after my operation
8186109 i look forward to going back to school to meet my friends
8186110 i condemn outright this attempted robbery against two visitors to our city on holiday
8186111 i wish to express my sympathy to them for what must have been a very traumatic experience especially as its reported a knife was used in this attack
8186112 its important that the victims of this attack know what happened to them is totally unrepresentative of the vast majority of the people of derry
8186113 we must do all in our power to get knives of our streets
8186114 i want to make an appeal for anyone who has information about this attack to bring it forward to the psni straight away so that the people behind it can be brought to justice and made accountable for their actions
8186115 i couldnt believe it in front of me was reams of extremely confidential information about thousands and thousands of people
8186116 we want to stress that this is an isolated incident and we are investigating how the server was removed and sold
8186117 rbs and natwest take data protection extremely seriously and have very strict procedures to ensure the security of information at all times

8186124 it would be unthinkable for us not to be in the champions league
8186125 it would be a disaster not to get through but nobody in the squad is thinking about anything other than qualifying
8186126 i am not even considering the option of liverpool not qualifying for the group stages i am just thinking about winning
8186127 my concern now is to improve how we play we can play better i am confident we will play much much better li ge were good in the first leg but we were really poor if we improve and play at our real level it will be very difficult for them
8186128 i am aware of the financial implications money is always important in football
8186129 i sincerely hope that the georgian people will one day have leaders they deserve who care about their country and who develop mutually respectful relations with all the peoples in the caucasus
8186130 in international relations you cannot have one rule for some and another rule for others
8186131 on the grounds that they allegedly had no proper language or history or culture and so did not need a university
8186132 these were tinderboxes right on russias doorstep which russian peacekeepers strove to keep from igniting
8186133 this was not a war of our choice we have no designs on georgian territory
8186134 well instead of asking why dont you just take a look

8186139 we know that people with incomes that low are living in unsafe conditions
8186140 children probably are not getting enough healthy food to eat people may be living in shelters seniors are likely skipping dosages of medication to make ends meet
8186141 we know that many people are struggling harder and harder just to get by and more vulnerable people are turning to public services for help
8186142 this reinforces the need to strengthen our strained safety net and policymakers must pay attention to these startling figures

8186157 i wasnt expecting this to come back with two gold medals is just amazing
8186158 i think the races have sunk in but i dont think the world record will sink in for a long long time
8186159 mum and dad play the races over and over again and i say to dad that ive seen it
8186160 its just been so overwhelming last night when i got home everyone was out
8186161 its so nice to see everyone who has supported me its good to see all their efforts pay off as well

8186164 shes very grounded and takes it all in her stride i dont think she fully understood what we did and its only dawning on her now
8186165 shes just a natural she comes across on telly and radio as she is
8186166 people can identify with that shes very self effacing there are no airs and graces people like her and think they are good qualities
8186167 we start at 6am in the morning and go to 8am and then we go from five to seven in the evening and we do that from monday through to friday
8186168 she goes 70 kilometres in a week and then there are four or five land sessions its a punishing regime
8186169 when shes in training and in competition she watches her diet very closely and then in the last two or three weeks before a major competition we reduce that down so she can reach her racing weight
8186170 once the competitions have finished shes allowed a few treats i know shes dying for a mcdonalds
8186171 she eats a well balanced and healthy diet its not high in protein or carbohydrates just well balanced
8186172 im very proud of her the more young people can do for mansfield the better we really are very proud of her shes a true mansfield girl
8186173 mansfield has so much negative press shes typical of mansfield people shes caring shes open and shes respectful mansfield people are lovely people
8186174 we know what shes put in for her swimming its absolutely fantastic its awesome only one in a million makes olympic swimming let alone win a gold medal and shes won two mansfield is a very small town in nottinghamshire and its great to have a local girl get two gold medals
8186175 for me a phase of weakening and a progressive convalescence is the most likely scenario
8186176 after the german economy began the year with a bang that was to be expected i nonetheless foresee more than a simple correction
8186177 domestic demand in particular is developing less strongly than anticipated but this weakness will be temporary
8186178 weak banks should be allowed to disappear from the market
8186179 bad management must be sanctioned a rescue is justified only when there is a threat to the entire financial system
8186180 oil markets are keeping a nervous eye on hurricane gustav with forecasts showing it may move into the gulf of mexico
8186181 as well diplomatic tensions involving russia have intensified following russias decision to recognise as independent states both south ossetia and abkhazia
8186182 for oil traders it is another weekend of storm watch

8186187 this is probably one of the hardest workouts you can do

8186194 the board remains convinced of the fundamental value of the business over the medium and long term and our primary focus is to amend certain of the existing borrowing agreements
8186195 to this end the group is engaged in constructive dialogue and is not aware of any issues which would prevent these amendments being finalised by the end of this year
8186196 constructive discussions with the relevant lenders are ongoing and the board is of the view that a satisfactory conclusion will be reached
8186197 according to the villagers their enemies give false report to americans that foreign fighters were gathering in the village
8186198 the taliban use the money from opium and we must stop that

8186200 while emphasizing its strong commitment to the eradication of poppy fields the government of afghanistan opposes the aerial spraying of poppy fields as an instrument of eradication
8186201 i think weve seen some really strong local governance this year
8186202 in nangarhar the governor went to very remote areas and told farmers if you dont agree with this and continue to grow opium i will arrest you he followed that up and went back and actually took some farmers to jalalabad and had them arrested

8186222 for the first time a thorough sensitivity analysis of internationally comparable poverty estimates has been carried out second a poverty line that is relevant specifically to the asia and pacific region has been adopted
8186223 while the 1 a day poverty line remains an appropriate benchmark for counting the extent of extreme poverty in asia and the developing world more generally in a region that has witnessed rapid economic growth it might also be time to evaluate poverty incidence using a benchmark that reflects the regions dynamism
8186224 ppps are one of the most vital ingredients in generating internationally comparable estimates of poverty
8186225 our aim in the study was to shed light on how alternative approaches to compiling purchasing power parities can influence internationally comparable estimates of poverty

8186253 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job of hiding it tonight i promise you that
8186254 youre asking an awful lot of high school guidance counselors because the parents arent there to help students
8186255 when language is a factor it becomes extra challenging to meet the high standards
8186256 we really want to be culturally responsive in our teaching
8186257 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8186258 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8186259 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8186260 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8186261 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8186262 it is just one year but it does suggest that womens efforts to get more education and to be even more committed to employment may be paying off
8186263 in silicon valley youve got that technology aspect but its still a male dominated field
8186264 its changing but its going to take time there are more women graduates now but they are young women and they are just entering the workforce i think within five years things will be very different
8186265 were concerned that the data were seeing today reflect a high water mark
8186266 the indicators for 2008 suggest that a year from now the income and poverty data will be much grimmer for california
8186267 people earning low amounts for doing housekeeping or landscaping or for busing dishes they might not live in the city of san jose because its a high cost area
8186268 we know the economy has continued to grow with jobs at the top and at the bottom
8186269 where were weak is in the middle thats one reason why were excited about the opportunity with tesla
8186270 whats closing the gap is mens relatively flat earnings over time and womens rising earnings
8186271 mens earnings now are really no different than they were in the early 70s in real terms
8186272 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8186273 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8186274 president clinton and sen obama dont have to text each other saying bffs
8186275 i ask all of you who worked so hard for me who knocked on doors who got into arguments from time to time to work for barack obama as hard as you did for me
8186276 lets devote all the passion and energy we have and theres a lot of it

8186279 die effiziente und kompetente nutzung der informations und kommunikationstechnologie ist gerade in mittelst ndischen betrieben wichtige voraussetzung zur steigerung von wettbewerbsf higkeit und innovationskraft auf der mediamit kaiserslautern stellt die heimische itk wirtschaft erfolgreiche produkte und dienstleistungen vor und zeigt wie die verschiedenartigen anforderungen von unternehmen an it l sungen gemeistert werden
8186280 als zentrales wirtschaftsf rderungsinstitut des landes sehen wir es als wichtige standortmarketingaufgabe an die it messe mediamit zu unterst tzen die mediamit hat sich in den vergangenen neun jahren zu einer bedeutsamen informationsplattform f r innovative unternehmen im it bereich entwickelt
8186281 wir sind gerne als sponsor behilflich die initiatoren zu unterst tzen und freuen uns ber das von jahr zu jahr steigende interesse von ausstellern und besuchern
8186282 wir hoffen dass die verleger die letzten wochen dazu genutzt haben sich konstruktiv mit unseren berechtigten forderungen auseinanderzusetzen
8186283 wir fordern f r die zweite verhandlungsrunde ein tarifangebot der zeitschriftenverleger die kolleginnen und kollegen in den redaktionen haben ein anrecht auf einen raschen tarifabschluss
8186284 we zijn blij met de vrijlating van hu shigen maar het is tragisch dat hij zoveel jaren van mishandeling ernstige gezondheidsproblemen en slechte omstandigheden heeft moeten doorstaan
8186285 negatief nieuws vaak luider klinkt en langer nazindert dan correcte en genuanceerde informatie
8186286 heeft het niet gemakkelijk maar ondanks zware concurrentie uit lagelonenlanden met een aantal herstructureringen en sluitingen als gevolg blijft textiel in onze regio een hoogtechnologische sector veel bedrijven kunnen zich probleemloos meten met de grote spelers op wereldvlak
8186287 doordat de vraag veel groter is dan het aanbod doen diverse textielbedrijven dan ook aantrekkelijke voorstellen aan de pas afgestudeerden
8186288 riesce anche a memorizzare quelle che non sono ancora presenti nel database in modo che poi possano essere studiate analizzate e si possa ricreare le risposte per chi eventualmente dovesse riproporre quei medesimi quesiti
8186289 he about broke my hand with that ball he hit right at me
8186290 just because i expected us to be in a real good position right now
8186291 instead its another year where we are battling our rear ends off to try to get to the playoffs
8186292 i felt like i put together a real good first half but im frustrated that i havent been able to get on a real good run in the second half
8186293 we are taking it a day at a time and see how he feels
8186294 he could do a simulated game double a trenton and triple a scranton wilkes barre are in the playoffs so there is time
8186295 we are going to do what is best for him
8186296 no one is called up unless they earn their way up
8186297 the throw skipped off the grass and i couldnt get a handle on it to throw it
8186298 i couldnt tell whether the umpire called bailey safe or out but i was looking to throw home when i reached into my glove i had to stay back to pick it out of the dirt and wasnt able to make a throw home
8186299 i have always been a proponent of it i am glad its coming
8186300 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8186301 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8186302 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8186303 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8186304 while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8186305 it was actually pretty similar the way he held it there are little things that he showed me that kind of helped me out the things he showed me with his grip the way he released it
8186306 weve been very good at recovering and coming back the next day
8186307 its sore i got this in 2006 and i couldnt squat this time i can squat
8186308 i gave up three runs early and then i broke out my change up
8186309 i was throwing strikes with my fastball so i figured i could carry it into the seventh and hold them to three runs it didnt work out and i didnt get the job done
8186310 when you play every day you get your butt kicked sometime
8186311 you want to see a good pitch and put your a swing on it that wasnt a good pitch and it wasnt an a swing
8186312 we are digging ourselves a big trench to climb out of
8186313 in the course of winning a championship there will be some damage to some folks
8186314 thats the sacrifice thats the cost the price organizations come up with all kinds of data and stuff but where we are in new york the bottom line is wins
8186315 somebody has to do something that they havent done before
8186316 they never quit and they know how to use this ballpark
8186317 theyll have to come down here and write this thing out
8186318 theyve got me here writing it the lineup out im signing it
8186319 when you have a bullpen you cant trust you are in trouble every night
8186320 weve been a team that hasnt been able to add on runs and when we dont it seems to come back and haunt us
8186321 we have to all be somewhat at fault in a game like this because we didnt hold them and we didnt add on runs
8186322 in this stadium with this team you just never know
8186323 and ive always said that in the course of winning a championship there will be some damage to some folks thats the sacrifice the cost the price of a championship someone will have to do something that they havent done before thats the price that you pay
8186324 i think im really happy with the work that we got the last two weeks against two good defenses
8186325 you go against the giants they create the problems that they create i think thats been great work for us and allowed us to assess some things that we need to do better
8186326 weve been getting plenty of work in practice against each other
8186327 this is my second year in the offense so im a lot more familiar with everything
8186328 we work really hard against in each other in practice so a lot of times the game reps honestly dont matter once you get to the regular season
8186329 i think with anybody released at this time the one thing you always talk to them about is just because it didnt work out here doesnt mean its not going to work out for you
8186330 you need to keep pursuing your dream this is by no means saying you cant do it
8186331 do muslims believe that a murder will spend more time burning for his sin vs a person who ate during fast
8186332 do they believe once forgiven everyone will go to heaven and get same rewords
8186333 the crofton hall estate is a wonderful property and no doubt provides a rare opportunity and we are keen to see the site suitably developed to realise its full potential
8186334 it is a unique chance to buy a cumbrian landmark and we want to achieve the best possible return on the sale to invest directly into frontline services that matter to the people of cumbria
8186335 im delighted to be finishing the 1000 year swim at dulwich leisure centre
8186336 with southwark council pledging 5 million towards the refurbishment of the pool its very exciting to think that this historic community building will be open and available for local people to use for many years to come
8186337 this is exactly the sort of investment that victorian and edwardian pools around the country need if they are to continue to be a source of pride we congratulate fusion leisure centres and southwark council on securing the future of this historic pool and hope councils around the country will take note
8186338 the swim has taken me to some of englands best loved local landmarks and hidden gems along the way ive met many people who are passionate about the future of britains victorian and edwardian pools and the opportunity they give everyone to immerse themselves in living history
8186339 we must work hard to ensure that adequate funding and expertise is available to keep our remaining historic pools open to everybody for many years to come
8186340 they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse
8186341 to influence them to speak ill about zimbabwe ostensibly because of the land issue
8186342 shipments of goods paid for by zimbabwe had been seized while in some cases payment meant for procuring goods from europe and america were frozen
8186343 told me what was good nutrition and what wasnt and i made the choices that was good for me i dont like being told what to do
8186344 it was no impact on my legs and hips they hurt because of her obesity
8186345 every month i add something nutritious then find something not nutritious and eliminate it
8186346 its the little things that make all the difference in my life i was always the fattest kid in school in fact most of the people in my family are overweight part of every celebration is food your eating habits really get tied up with your emotional life
8186347 there is no such thing as a shanghai housing market there are at least 13 markets with all different characteristics

8186356 this was important as we had to select an area that did not have a slope otherwise a stationed train would start sliding down the track making it cumbersome for us to manage train boarding
8186357 while the tracks have arrived the fish plates will arrive in the next consignment from china shortly in september the engine and the coaches will be shipped from uk in october by this time we expect the work on the train maintenance yard to be completed
8186358 the name of the train has to be embossed on the engine and they have asked for a customized design for the train while the interiors are being readied
8186359 what is given can be taken away everyone lies everyone dies
8186360 but then she called me back saying that her mom pretty much has told her that no she needs to keep the baby and that shes not giving it up for adoption even though she really did not want to have the baby
8186361 i have spent every day since monday june 9 2008 looking for my daughter
8186362 i have lied and stolen from friends and family to do whatever i could by any means to find my daughter i avoided calling the police or even notifying my family out of fear i have been and still am afraid of what has or may happen to caylee
8186363 if i really wanted to just get rid of her i wouldve left her with my parents and i wouldve left
8186364 i wouldve moved out i wouldve given my mom custody
8186365 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate

8186377 effectively robbing one of the most poor and disenfranchised people
8186378 we strongly believe that uranium mining could be an opportunity for our people to generate equity and commercial benefit and importantly play an important part in the development of significant resources projects for this state
8186379 legislating a ban becomes even more hypocritical when the prime minister apologises to the indigenous people of australia and overturns a long held ban on uranium mining due to it becoming obsolete
8186380 that is one reason why as a people we are exploring opportunities away from the government sector for us to play a pro active role in our future an opportunity we believe has been taken away from us by the premier yesterday
8186381 its a residential area and main through road for a local school opposite the residents so despite the tragic outcome of one person deceased were very lucky no other person was affected he told reporters

8186388 i think the voters are educated and they know who will serve them best
8186389 i hope they continue to place their trust in me because my heart is with them
8186390 this isnt about any certain individual this is about reconnecting the county commission with the people of hillsborough county
8186391 if this becomes a traditional campaign of mudslinging and negative politics the new voters and the young voters will not come out
8186392 this is a lull after the convention its go time
8186393 i think one of the biggest misconceptions about the youth vote is theyre all showing up because barack obama is cool
8186394 were going to inherit everything we want to know about the economy what are you going to do about the health care is social security ever going to be there when we get there
8186395 the election of barack obama is simply one piece of what i think is a sea change
8186396 i almost think there is a turn off key for young people
8186397 the goal of everyone is to have this facility in its current form exist in perpetuity on solid financial footing
8186398 i dont feel concerned about it well just have to wait and see
8186399 the residents are supportive of life care the bank is supportive of life care and the sumner board is supportive of life care
8186400 the likelihood is that life care and what its doing will remain in place going forward
8186401 the institution has been into the fourth quarter now unable to operate the facility paying its debts as they come due and service the financing that is owed to the banks on account of construction
8186402 sumners board has been very forthright with the residents on keeping them up to speed as far as whats going on
8186403 thats their hope that they can find a good purchaser to keep it going in perpetuity
8186404 the expectation is a significant portion of it will be forgiven
8186405 there is a realization by the banks that in the event that the exemption is not granted or its not granted to the extent they are seeking thats going to have an impact
8186406 there is no one who has a gun to this companys head saying if you dont do this by such and such a date i will pull the trigger and you will be dead
8186407 we are not in that situation happily as we sit here today
8186408 mostly what youve got today is good news but i wouldnt say weve turned the corner or anything like that
8186409 we all think we should keep up or do better than the cost of living and ive done that but the last nine months kind of snuck up i just started noticing less money
8186410 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8186411 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8186412 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8186413 doch der image schaden f r unternehmen und marken ist bereits angerichtet
8186414 beispielsweise muss gut berlegt sein wer als antragsteller in erscheinung treten soll

8186416 its a great relief to everyone he is getting treatment
8186417 but to european people it is a very american problem i do not know any similar examples from my country which is belgium
8186418 well youre kind of a tiny country but there has been somebody in the netherlands which is close by who buried his victims so its not unknown
8186419 as a child living in a small town near pittsburgh i never knew my real parents its not that i didnt yearn to find out it just wasnt part of the deal my parents werent that kind sure six other children and i had a roof over our heads and food but when it came to the real security that love can provide well it simply wasnt present it sometimes seemed that the reason six others and i were children to these people was due to factors not understood even now our lives as children were often unremittingly dark and we were very alone in the world the parents defined
8186420 the fbi says that you only have to kill three people to be considered a serial killer
8186421 ours is seven and above because three people if youre in an urban area can be almost any neighborhood but seven was a number that in reviewing the history of serial killers across time seemed to be a very low number
8186422 deeper into the psyches of killers than any profiler before her
8186423 they dont have passion they dont have sadness they dont have happiness theyre hollow shells
8186424 rather it had more to do with the still babylike macek enjoying the touch feel and smell of the softer cotton fabric the crotch was made of avoiding the coarser cotton in the rest of the panty you might well ask well why not touch or chew a t shirt a t shirt just isnt as soft as panties
8186425 it wasnt that the panties had sexual meaning to him he just liked the feeling of them in his hand and on his body
8186426 its important not to read too much into this act
8186427 because gacy was not a necrophiliac who commonly had sex with dead bodies what he did was a combination of experimentation with a body and something he saw as comfortable he wanted to lie down and the coffin seemed to be the handiest thing available what gacy did with the body had nothing to do with the power and control that is said to fuel the need for necrophilia and unlike necrophiles who avoid relating to living people gacy had a full social life
8186428 was not sexual but an effort to resolve his confusion about the line between life and death
8186429 fred west like john gacy may have exhibited signs of necrophilia
8186430 but he was not a necrophiliac because at its most basic necrophilia refers to having sexual attraction to corpses not having sex with them nor was he purely a sexual sadist because a sadist doesnt always kill did he hurt people yes did he get sexual pleasure from hurting people that same elation the average person gets from sex with a lover in the missionary position no
8186431 and i doubt it did it was an excitement but not a sexual excitement
8186432 its a very concrete contact its a body contact but its not a sexual contact a lot of people have tried to make these paraphilic offenders and theyre not
8186433 youre talking about an act whether somebody gets pleasure or whatever out of the act makes it more than just the act they look sexual to the average uninformed person but to the serial killer its a way to be in contact do you know what i mean
8186434 i keep running up against this bias that its all sexually motivated
8186435 but bathory was not a serial killer according to my definition
8186436 i dont believe her killings had anything to do with strange sexual preferences nor were they combined with a deep aggression her horrible actions were just something she believed she had to do to remain pretty killing those virgins was the only way she felt she could make her belief a reality
8186437 youd have almost an even 50 50 or 60 40 mix of male female
8186438 thick bodied with slumped postures and puffy faces like the pillsbury dough boy
8186439 if they had some kind of genetic mutation that made them appear human
8186440 it is as if someone took a cookie cutter from a kitchen drawer labeled serial murderer
8186441 the baker stamps out the dough and puts them in the oven to bake when theyre done they come out ready to kill
8186442 no serial murderers are addicted to drugs drink or even smoking
8186443 serial murderers are always extremely well put together whether they have a lot of money or not theyre highly presentable individuals who take care of themselves
8186444 many of the serial murderers i have met are average men who are overweight and doughy
8186445 that serial murderers are not the scheming people they seem to be
8186446 ed gein experimented by wearing a suit made of skin as did john gacy by putting the heads of his victims under water to see if theyd survive it was all coming together i could now say with assurance that at least some experimentation was part of every serial killers way of working
8186447 berdella was an experimenter but unlike even the most amateur scientist he conducted his experiments as rote actions only
8186448 berdella actually reminded me of another famous experimenter h h mudgett who killed during the chicago worlds fair she doubtless means herman w mudgett who used the alias h h holmes both drew no thoughtful conclusions from what they did certainly berdella developed no theories based upon the confessed killing and mutilation and dismemberment of six men
8186449 in the book i am not going to sit down and go through all of the scientific stuff to make it easier for somebody to understand
8186450 lockhart was compelled to feel and touch jennifers warm blood and intestines he pulled at touched and examined what was inside of her but not in any truly sexual way also when someone cuts open a human body theres a warmth that rushes up that has been described by some as appealing to serial murderers who as ive said have not progressed past infancy emotionally lockhart wanted to see what was there what it looked like what it felt like what it smelled like
8186451 the old remedy used to be to put them in a car and drive around until they calm
8186452 what did you make of the fact that this person down here has been throwing bodies into the river
8186453 we have seen that here in chicago that john wayne gacy disposed of bodies in that way
8186454 not necessarily he might very well vary it and he could do that easily
8186455 the answer was as abrupt and brusque as it was startling not interested
8186456 if the president of the united states was there with him at the time
8186457 rudely had said i didnt know what i was talking about
8186458 and they did the show but i never heard from them again
8186459 sometimes ive received blank stares sometimes ive been laughed at
8186460 highly inappropriate and outside his purview as a forensic clinician
8186461 kunkle was asking me whether it would be possible to put gacy in a mental institution forever
8186462 i was saying no sooner or later hed get out helen is quite right in saying that we dont know how to cure a personality as disordered as have no therapy or medication for that whatsoever but in the absence of treatment a hospital would simply be warehousing him and theres no real legal basis for that eventually hed be released you just have to look at where the john hinckley case is headed now theres really no such thing as locking the door and throwing away the key
8186463 its very hard to argue that all serial killers can be made to fit a single common category
8186464 ive sort of lost touch with her back in the 80s and early 90s she seemed pretty active at least locally i think she got involved in some trials involving serial homicides and she was definitely around doing things at conferences as for the last decade or so im really drawing a blank but the person you really should talk to is robert ressler hes a real giant in the field he learned it from the ground up while establishing the fbis behavioral science unit out in quantico virginia
8186465 behavioral scientists dont do the medical work that i do to discover what makes a serial killer commit murder after murder
8186466 theyll look at the external characteristics of the person and sometimes they get into a false way of psychoanalyzing the serial murderer they come up with ideas like he hates his mother and thats why he murdered but the ideas have no basis in scientific research
8186467 the problem is that the phenomena shes talking about just dont lend themselves to broad generalizations
8186468 id be very interested to see what sort of documentation she has to back it up i dont keep a scorecard but ive been doing this work on a fully funded basis for 32 years and i would estimate ive spoken to perhaps 40 people who have killed multiply
8186469 the question of definitions is a major problem in this field
8186470 but the one i give in the crime classification a book sort of like the dsm of violent crime is pretty well accepted its a serial killing if there are more than three victims killed in more than three separate events taking place at more than three locations over a length of time and there has to be a cooling off period involved it could be days or weeks or months but the point is that the killer regains equilibrium in between killings typically the perpetrators thinking processes are driven by fantasy usually sexual the crimes are usually premeditated the killer likely doesnt know who the next victim will be but he has actions already rehearsed in his mind but none of these are absolutes its useless to impose too rigid a structure on crimes like these because real life is always a lot messier than theory
8186471 if helens saying that the men vastly outnumber the women shes correct
8186472 but by my definition female serial killers definitely exist dorothea puente in sacramento for example she killed at least 7 men and maybe 20 more so she could cash their pension checks
8186473 but the work i did at the bsu distinguishes between organized and unorganized serial killers and the motivations of organized serial killers are basically sexual a lot of times even actions that are not overtly sexual the insertion of foreign objects into body cavities for instance serve an underlying sexual purpose
8186474 no serial murderers are addicted to drugs drink or even smoking
8186475 i just dont understand why helen feels the need to talk in absolutes like that
8186476 if she means that drugs and alcohol dont turn people into serial killers shes right though i dont know that anyone ever said they did
8186477 because ive got some that are in current legal issues
8186478 it was gacy and robert joe long in florida and at that point i said you know this is turning into a conflict and i wasnt going to do it anymore the conflict is having to be both a researcher scientist and someone who testifies
8186479 none unofficially many i make it a contingency of my working with law enforcement to be unofficial otherwise it will interfere with what im trying to do with these individuals im not a prosecutor im not an investigator i dont put myself in any position of wanting to run around with a gun on my hip which some forensic psychiatrists do
8186480 it was down in baton rouge his name is gillis he was arrested two weeks ago he killed at least eight and there are others hes suspected of i think hes just been indicted though im not quite sure
8186481 the detective i dont have the current person i do know a newspaper person down there who might be very helpful josh noel of the baton rouge advocate he and i have talked a couple of times in the past week i think theres something in the paper today as a matter of fact
8186482 as of right now im talking to the press two years ago i was talking to the investigating officer
8186483 i work with what are considered extremely difficult people opiate and cocaine addicts housewives who might be addicted to vicodin i work with severe to moderately retarded people who might be addicted to drugs or alcohol or might have a dual diagnosis meaning a psychiatric illness and i work with kids and adolescents so its a very varied kind of practice
8186484 i dont think ive testified in a criminal trial in maybe 15 years
8186485 op til hede og skovarealer hvilket giver gode muligheder for jagt p kronvildt

8186490 people are going to the website as they are basically tightening their belts
8186491 weve seen strong growth in savings customers rather than lending customers are also reviewing what they pay in insurance and utility bills rather than automatically renewing
8186492 we are in talks with three or four other companies and we are confident about finding a replacement for firstplus by the end of the third quarter
8186493 customers are more savvy now than they were maybe 12 months ago
8186494 they are looking at perhaps two or three price comparison sites but the market is not very mature and i would say most people will be looking at comparison sites online within the next three to five years

8186511 this financial grant is indicative of uspoultrys continuing support of all phases of the poultry and egg industry
8186512 and although the grant is directed at a specific and regional situation it is a critical issue that has a potentially far reaching and long term impact on the entire poultry and egg industry
8186513 so it is vital that uspoultry and the various segments of the industry join in supporting the egg industry in california 5m enterprises ltd

8186521 what georgia shows is that uncertain boundaries and oil and gas and russians are a volatile mix
8186522 if nothing else this should be a wake up call for us and we should not expect this to be a cakewalk with the russians they are very aggressive in pursuing what they believe are their interests
8186523 you need to actually have boots on the ground and boats in the water you need to have surveillance
8186524 there are communities who do not believe in immunization sometimes its for religious reasons they choose not to immunize themselves or their children and theyre very susceptible to infections when they come around
8186525 normally youre not even aware of whos immunized until there is an outbreak and then its very clear where these pockets of unimmunized people are living
8186526 what we are not seeing outside of those communities is a chain of transmission
8186527 if we saw sustained transmission not just the sporadic cases
8186528 dr patrick said diseases like mumps have become so rare that parents often dont think their children need vaccines
8186529 its a bit of a circular thing if you succeed with a vaccine people dont see the vaccine around for a while and they think we dont need it
8186530 there needs to be a responsibility that if you are in a susceptible phase of having the illness you dont spread it to someone else you do stay at home and i think that should be societys expectation of people whore going to take a risk that way
8186531 we found additional small fragments of copper and what appear to be nails and other materials
8186532 the inuit tradition indicates that a vessel in this vicinity was observed on fresh ice one spring when the hunters came for their seasonal hunting

8186548 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8186549 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8186550 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8186551 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8186552 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8186553 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8186554 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part

8186563 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8186564 the team emotionally was in a different place than we are this year
8186565 and when you win a game like that it really can make your season
8186566 obviously theres a lot of the season left to go this game doesnt get us to the playoffs and if we wouldve lost it wouldnt have knocked us out of the playoffs but as great as we feel right now the mets probably feel equally as bad
8186567 its designed for the hitter as long as youre in the right mentality
8186568 when you find your swing everything else comes back into play
8186569 youre a little more patient because you know where the ball has to be in order for you to hit it and then you know how to address the ball when youre searching for your swing you dont know what the heck you can and cant handle so youre just trying to do anything you can to put the bat on the ball
8186570 lets put it that way when youre able to take that and keep yourself motivated it helps
8186571 every team can go home and sleep better at night if they know the call was right
8186572 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult

8186574 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8186575 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8186576 everybody was tired of hearing about it so they finally had to step up and do something to make a change
8186577 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8186578 i shouldnt say it not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8186579 all we get all spring is speed up the game this certainly is not going to speed up the game if it takes too long this is not like football youve got a pitcher whos standing out there
8186580 whats the format what do you do id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie
8186581 imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8186582 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
8186583 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
8186584 with the sad loss of danish kaneria for the rest of the season it became necessary to consider our options for the rest of the campaign in terms of whether to sign another overseas player
8186585 after much discussion it was agreed by the cricket committee not to replace danish a decision which gives us a great opportunity to utilise the strength of our squad over the remaining weeks
8186586 our progress through to the second xi trophy final suggests there are a number of players on the fringes on the team waiting to get their chance
8186587 in addition to this the postponement of the icc champions trophy means we could also have alastair cook and ravi bopara available for the latter stages of the season
8186588 i have applied for the position and well just see what happens
8186589 itd be a huge honour if i get the opportunity i have an extensive cv and have coached all around the world
8186590 i would really enjoy the challenge and i think i have the skills to move the team forward

8186598 organisations going for the informal approach can lack structure in their environmental policies and this can affect the level of success that they achieve in reducing both energy costs and co2 emissions
8186599 while computers may drive efficiency the data centres that run businesses are often far from efficient they are at the heart of environmental challenges created by it but the average retailer just does not have the necessary knowledge to bring about change they need specialist help and the actions we offer in our thought leadership initiatives are designed to illustrate how they can improve their carbon footprint and wider environmental position while also reducing operating costs and improving it service delivery

8186624 i feel like part of the family i love the people here my wife and i moved here
8186625 just knowledge and i think the thing i need to keep reminding myself is with knowledge comes simplicity
8186626 thats something that vinny really hammered in and jakes been hammering into me this year so far
8186627 you may know the playbook but you need to know when to keep it simple you need to know when to throw the hitch even if you think something might be there on the other side throw the hitch move the chains
8186628 you want to get good film because you want to stay here
8186629 but obviously the business side of the nfl is not like that
8186630 the fourth preseason game i played awful because i put so much pressure on myself to do well
8186631 i played terrible in 1999 and the next year it was the same situation and my attitude was
8186632 i dont put all this pressure on myself saying oh ive done all of this and what happens if
8186633 i just want to go out there and play the game
8186634 boys amp girls club employees and volunteers are responsible for a variety of duties including coaching sports activities leading after school tutoring and mentoring and serving as general instructors referees and scorekeepers
8186635 we must be absolutely sure that we are doing everything we can to prevent people who should not have access to our kids out of the boys and girls club system with intelius support we are taking progressive steps to keep boys and girls clubs safe places where parents can be confident that their kids are surrounded by positive role models who have their best interests at heart
8186636 too often child care organizations are jolted to take a closer look at hiring policies only after a childs safety is compromised or they experience a close call
8186637 but increasingly organizations like the boys and girls club of bellevue are proactively screening volunteers and employees and parents are insisting on that level of precaution intelius is dedicated to giving individuals and organizations the ability to make better decisions about the safety of our kids today background checks are convenient and more accurate and cost effective than ever leaving little excuse for child centric organizations not to screen kudos to the boys and girls club of bellevue for doing it right
8186638 child safety is a core value for intelius and helping the boys amp girls club of bellevue create the safest possible environment for kids is one way we can continue that commitment
8186639 proactive screening by any organization that works with children including childcare providers youth groups and after school activity centers is a vital step to ensuring parents have peace of mind that their children are in good hands the boys amp girls club of bellevue is clearly committed to ensuring the safety and enrichment of the youth it serves

8186649 we need to have paying patients to continue serving all who walk through the doors and offset some of the losses that we incur from those who are uninsured and indigent
8186650 its not going to just cherry pick its going to be whats best for the community people want their health care in the community that they live in
8186651 why are we building new buildings when we have empty facilities that are operating at a financial disadvantage
8186652 theres a need in that area to be able to provide care if we dont do it i can guarantee university hospitals or the cleveland clinic will do it
8186653 we really feel strongly that in this northern region there is not the level of medical support that is needed
8186654 we think its critical for the care of the community
8186655 there are some greedy doctors out there and this is exactly what this is about
8186656 i think patients should have a choice and they should have a choice based on real quality factors not based on the fact that my doc is going to get some type of financial return based on sending me someplace
8186657 doctors dont do that as physicians the first thing truly is to take care of patients period
8186658 in order for us to maintain our ability to stay alive we have got to make sure people understand there is another side to this
8186659 its a threat to the safety net that akron general offers theres no question about that
8186660 we fully support it we certainly want the residents of northern summit county to have the best health care available
8186661 when one is fasting he must refrain from uttering false statements avoid a loud voice which will disturb others and if any one fights you tell him that you are fasting instead of fighting back
8186662 in the name of religion and consistent with the constitutional state policy on the free exercise of religious belief
8186663 respect for the free exercise of fasting by the muslims
8186664 another surgeon reconstructed the inside but cosmetically nothing more could be done
8186665 i truly thought in my heart of hearts i was doing the right thing
8186666 we got caught in the tornado when he slipped out of control
8186667 he never informed me he wasnt licensed he was telling me to get facials after the botched surgery i must have spent 800 on facials
8186668 hes suspended and hes breaking florida statute if he continues to practice
8186669 anybody can say what they want but there are two sides of every story
8186670 hes a talented well educated man who has now lost what he worked so hard for
8186671 hes now a four time convicted felon and going to prison
8186672 no hay se ales de un v nculo con el terrorismo esta vez
8186673 im an rn but right now im staying home with my grandson
8186674 just enjoy your time your day your minute while you have it
8186675 he reminds me so much of her even though hes a boy
8186676 we are pleased by the pending merger of campofrio and groupe smithfield the merger clearly creates a european packaged meats powerhouse with the number one share in many major markets
8186677 this merger also monetizes our investment in the groupe smithfield joint venture into a 37 percent share in a publicly traded company with 3 billion in sales
8186678 given the overall adverse environment of the industry i am pleased with the results for the current quarter
8186679 our fresh pork operations and our packaged meats business performed well in the face of sharply rising input costs we are continuing to focus closely on our cost structure and improving plant operating efficiencies also our new management structure is in place and moving forward nicely
8186680 we continue to be challenged by high input costs across all the businesses certainly a portion of this increase is the result of the current ethanol policy in place
8186681 the current government mandate puts the company in a position of having to compete with foreign oil for feed for our livestock this mandate has resulted in more than 30 percent of the corn crop being diverted from animal feed to ethanol production resulting in a sharp run up in corn prices tied to world oil markets this is a dynamic this industry has never faced we believe this policy is flawed and needs to be revised if food cost inflation is to be brought under control
8186682 there is no nation that we cant out hustle and out compete
8186683 and no american need be left out or left behind
8186684 any wisconsin political observer would be lying to you if they didnt admit cutting taxes has been a powerful motivating issue in wisconsin
8186685 where has it gotten us gas at 4 a gallon high prices for health care runaway inflation this horrible economy
8186686 barack obama is clearly out of touch with the needs of american families
8186687 make sure rich people continue to get these huge tax breaks
8186688 i think tapping into that anger among voters will be very important
8186689 there are 8 5 million people we know of who are unemployed and there are less than 4 million available jobs
8186690 the reality is republicans recognize and have been long saying that washington is broken that overspending in washington is a severe impediment to the growth of our economy
8186691 if you cant start by eliminating pork who are we kidding about our ability to address the more pressing challenges on the budget side
8186692 i think the moderate democrats are more fiscally conservative so i think mccain will have some appeal there and independents are more fiscally conservative
8186693 work hard and play by the rules you can go as far in life as your talent and dedication will take you
8186694 in wisconsin and across our country today people are working just as hard as ever they are still playing by the rules but they are finding their dreams further and further out of reach
8186695 for the past eight years we had a president more concerned about the health of our insurance companies than the health of the american people
8186696 there is no us versus them black white latino american were all in this together we are not separate
8186697 however since 1978 more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with ayurvedic medicine use have been reported worldwide
8186698 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits among the metal containing products 95 percent were sold by u s web sites and 75 percent claimed good manufacturing practices
8186699 current regulations governing the quality of herbal supplements made and sold in the us and india are inadequate we recommend strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements manufacturers should have to demonstrate compliance with these standards through independent third party laboratory testing
8186700 if we know what the target is it makes it easier to hit the target
8186701 although the current study focused on ayurvedic medicines reports of similar problems with toxic metals in other traditional medicines e g chinese mexican middle eastern and western herbal supplements have been reported saper said
8186702 products made by members of the american herbal product assn capsules liquids pastes are less likely to contain toxic metals
8186703 products that have obtained seals of quality approval from consumer lab com and the united states pharmacopeia usp can be assumed to be free of significant levels of toxic metals
8186704 this problem always seems more acute during hard economic times
8186705 we are seeing some of the same things play out
8186706 the fact is the vast majority of the public has some kind of health insurance
8186707 you never really understand it until you live it and i think thats the problem
8186708 until somebody thinks they may be in that situation nobody cares
8186709 it is a deep and growing and you could say even gnawing fear among the middle class
8186710 the economy today is in much worse shape than it was a year ago
8186711 if i had to pick one place to ride out the recession of 2008 2009 it would be the state of texas
8186712 they are making choices of rent utilities gas in the car
8186713 when we talk with people we find that the need is more profound
8186714 we are seeing a little bit more increase in medicaid
8186715 it looked like it started to trend up in the last part of 2007
8186716 im up there in tallahassee taking care of your taxpayers dollars
8186717 i dont have any intention of running against a popular incumbent governor
8186718 in florida its virtually impossible to win statewide if youve never run statewide before
8186719 be it governor or u s senate people are going to expect her to decline it before they weigh in
8186720 were getting closer to the decision point and i want to listen to people and listen to my advisers and evaluate the opportunities
8186721 im not interested in going out and being a grandstander but when there are legitimate opportunities ill take a stand
8186722 focus on helping the party unite behind the nominee when the contest is over
8186723 right now im planning to run for re election ill get past this election cycle and then ill make a decision about the future
8186724 i think people are a little intimidated by it because its so fragrant
8186725 the key to this is not for us to gob off about this or anything because we havent won the series
8186726 i am in this race because i believe i am the strongest candidate the strongest candidate to lead our party in november of 2008 and the strongest president to lead our nation starting in january 2009
8186727 john mccain has decided that he is running for george bushs third term in office that is what his campaign has been about to offer the american people four more years of the same approach that has failed the american people for the last eight years
8186728 republicans run on government doesnt work and then they get elected and prove their point
8186729 protect the dignity of our soldiers who lost their lives but also make clear to the iraqi government that we are going to leave
8186730 the last three republican presidents are responsible for 83 percent of the huge debt we now face and 40 percent of the reduction in the value of the dollar
8186731 the leading obstructionist in the country mitch mcconnell represents us
8186732 i couldnt tear myself away from 3 quarks daily to the point of neglecting my work congratulations on this superb site
8186733 i have placed 3 quarks daily at the head of my list of web bookmarks
8186734 just wanted you to know im one of many who reads and enjoys 3 quarks almost daily
8186735 he has trouble breathing so he is on a ventilator at the moment and he has a little bleeding from his stomach which is giving us some concern
8186736 but on the other hand considering the ordeal he went through there are no internal injuries and there are no broken bones
8186737 i always had him in the back of my mind as far as just when id get down and worried about myself id think about what he was doing and what he was going through
8186738 he was a little bit of a motivation for me just to keep going through everything
8186739 what ive liked about cody since hes been here is he has really developed as a player he transitioned from a core special teams guy and was able to work at outside linebacker then he worked in the sub package hes also worked at inside linebacker so hes created position flexibility
8186740 i thought i did pretty good in training camp last year as far as learning the system and establishing myself as an outside linebacker but then sitting out and having to watch all year it just kind of gives you the desire to get back out there
8186741 its nice to be out there and its nice to be healthy getting to play all different positions and learning everything
8186742 if it was the real season and i was getting sacks like that it would be pretty cool but i would say preseason doesnt really count as much
8186743 when youre on ir youre just sitting there and you feel like youre just wasting away
8186744 none of the coaches really associate with you anymore because youre not playing football it was hard but my brother was a motivation for me
8186745 cody really developed a preparation routine and that routine hes followed hes been disciplined with it and you see the jumps in his play as hes stayed with it
8186746 i grew up on the coast in south texas and my dad works on oil rigs so i was either off shore with my dad on an oil rig or i was shrimping with my grandpa
8186747 my grandpa would come and pick me up and it was an opportunity to make some good money as a kid most people might think its a little weird or redneck but if you ever got a chance to do it youd see it was pretty cool
8186748 theres a substantial amount of information we have yet to see
8186749 my understanding is there was a boyfriend girlfriend relationship between the accused and victim of the alleged assault
8186750 the only thing i can comment on at this time is that it appears the assault had taken place before the actual homicide took place

8186756 temos jogadores lesionados mas se os substitutos fizerem aquilo que s o capazes n o haver problemas
8186757 n o penso que a derrota no primeiro jogo da poca v afectar os meus jogadores pois o apuramento para a uefa champions league uma motiva o totalmente diferente
8186758 vai ser um jogo muito dif cil mas acreditamos nas nossas capacidades

8186760 o desafio da uefa champions league muito importante para n s
8186761 a nossa motiva o enorme mas sei que isso n o ser suficiente os turcos s o favoritos por isso temos de jogar com intelig ncia com a cabe a e os p s a funcionarem em un ssono temos de escolher os momentos certos tanto para defender como para atacar os adeptos de istambul criam sempre um ambiente impressionante mas acredito que os meus jogadores ser o capazes de manter a calma vai ser um teste dif cil mas estou optimista
8186762 the mccain campaign has no estimate of how many of americas 47 million uninsured would likely gain coverage under its plan
8186763 would allow health insurance companies to escape state regulations they dont like such as rules allowing for appeals when companies deny coverage and rules requiring insurers to cover people with various conditions or to cover particular types of treatments the companies would likely gravitate to the states with the regulations they most favored
8186764 most important security problem s that the united states faces
8186765 its not even a theoretical discussion its an impossible discussion
8186766 greeted with alarm by some republican supporters and wariness by important u s allies
8186767 proposing this healthcare bill of rights will be one of my first actions as your u s senator
8186768 few politicians or policy makers ever talk about this shortage which will get worse in the next few years approximately 40 of todays physicians are within ten years of retirement
8186769 these problems with kentuckys healthcare system speak volumes about mitch mcconnells poor leadership in washington once again mitch mcconnell manifests a total lack of care for the people i will put people first as your u s senator
8186770 we cannot afford to give john mccain a chance to serve out george bushs third term we need change in america and that is why we will be united in november
8186771 tonight we have come from behind we have broken the tie and thanks to you it is full speed on to the white house
8186772 these next primaries are another test i am going to work my heart out in west virginia and kentucky this month and i intend to win them in november in the general election
8186773 from that perspective exercise prevented the negative effects of the sugar
8186774 but you look at an obese person and their knees are bad and they can barely move and you think is this good quality of life
8186775 theres data that show that lean healthy endurance athletes on average eat 50 percent more calories than obese people
8186776 to optimize health it should be healthy food such as whole grains fresh fruits and vegetables
8186777 to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8186778 when the boys were born benjamin weighed 6 pounds 3 ounces and alexander was 4 pounds 6 ounces so there was definitely a weight discrepancy
8186779 and while benjamin was generally very healthy alexander had to spend almost three weeks in the nicu so we knew right away that something was wrong
8186780 within a few weeks of alexanders diagnosis we got hooked up with the national alpha 1 association and they led us to dr teckman in st louis being diagnosed early has helped us be diligent in following recommendations for things that will help him stay healthy
8186781 research on this topic is pivotal because it goes toward finding potential therapies
8186782 i think were still pretty far away from finding a cure but as for developing better treatments weve actually come a very long way
8186783 fourteen years ago we barely knew how the liver got hurt in alpha 1 patients now we have a lot of knowledge about exactly what happens inside the liver to cause damage
8186784 its like changing the blueprint for your house when it has already been built
8186785 that usually involves knocking down a wall or something really big
8186786 so when our son sean went to college for environmental studies in ashland wis john and i bought a house there the lakes are great places for strawberries blueberries cherries apples in the fall we make it a tradition to pick blueberries as a family
8186787 ive always played my guitar and sang alone in my living room
8186788 i stumbled into songwriting when i was 45 after my first song i was hooked i started performing at open mikes putting myself out there to get over my shyness
8186789 so when i got to that point in my life where it was like ok i have to decide what im going to do with my life cooking seemed logical
8186790 you learn that you dont earn the respect of your kitchen staff by yelling most people would rather be taught and talked to rather than yelled at and talked down to everyone has to be heading in the same direction or its just not going to work
8186791 as soon as you overprice the food traffic slows down i want to keep sandwiches in the single digits but some of the entrees will be in the low teens
8186792 you have these vats of animal fat that you put the biscuits in so it makes sense
8186793 he has been killed police have recovered his body and are trying to bring it down from the top of the mountain
8186794 its the worst thing that could possibly happen its what we hoped would never happen
8186795 we must not waste itos efforts i believe we should continue our activities
8186796 abm recognizing the enormous opportunities in todays global marketplace and its members needs is positioning itself to become the global b to b association
8186797 we are delighted to offer media members the opportunity to experience indias b to b community first hand much like we did in china in late 2006 bringing industry leaders together for a collective sharing of information ideas and challenges and we are thrilled to be working with both bpa worldwide and cross border media on this exciting indian venture abms journeys abroad support our strategic initiative to help our members grow globally and become the global business information association
8186798 given the economic vibrancy that is india and with the opening of media to foreign investment
8186799 there are great opportunities for foreign media firms in the b to b sector to collaborate with their counterparts in india we have been in contact with publishers in india interested in best business practices and sharing their experiences with peers in their b to b markets taking a delegation of our publishing members from around the globe who have an interest in doing business in india will result in precisely that as bpa worldwide is the largest global non profit organization tasked with auditing media in more than 30 countries our incoming indian publishers may have an interest in reciprocating and visiting other countries in which they may have an interest in expanding their brands
8186800 i am particularly impressed with the enthusiasm expressed by indian publishers who have pledged full support by way of sponsorships
8186801 in fact i see 2009 as a turning point in indias b to b publishing industry

8186806 this is one of the key moments in political history
8186807 women and children are significantly more likely to be poor than men and the poverty of children is inextricable from the poverty of their mothers
8186808 having a baby in the uk puts women at risk of moving into poverty this means that child poverty and mothers poverty have common causes and common solutions
8186809 we will only succeed in ending child poverty when we address mothers inequality by ensuring they have access to equal pay adequate benefits and freedom from discrimination
8186810 given that wales has traditionally been labours most rock solid area tackling child poverty would probably make more of a difference there to than anywhere else in the country to labours fortunes
8186811 i would say some people thought we were going to die that is how frightening it was
8186812 the woman sitting in the seats in front of us was whimpering
8186813 there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft
8186814 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask on my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state
8186815 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
8186816 he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
8186817 from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8186818 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
8186819 the first thing we do in these situations is divert to safety
8186820 the crew cant be making passenger pa announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8186821 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000ft where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off
8186822 will really only miss what we never had a good and kind mother

8186829 these three individuals were seen at the front gate of 8 croydon road very close to the time that xi zhou arrived home from work on august 7th
8186830 it is important for us to trace these three and speak to them as they may have important information
8186831 i am asking that anyone who has seen these three or who has any information about them contact my officers at once

8186838 the planning and running of elections need to be more robust and coordinated
8186839 we are still trying to run 21st century elections with 19th century structures and the system is under severe strain
8186840 ensuring that returning officers remain independent and are reinforced with the leadership support and direction of the chair of an election management board would build on the strengths of the current system
8186841 our proposal is designed to allow local returning officers to continue to respond to local circumstances while ensuring that there is a consistently high standard of service for all electors across the uk

8186849 this decision was met with enthusiasm by the voters throughout the second congressional district
8186850 people are tired of the dick cheney karl rove brand of politics that sells votes to the highest bidder
8186851 campaign contributions personal endorsements and organizational support have been tremendous

8186853 technological and business innovation is a key sustainable differentiator across business categories and certainly for our customers in research critical businesses like it kpo aerospace and defense manufacturing and pharmaceuticals the challenge that all customers face is to abstract the innovation that is localized with a few individuals and make it available to the whole innovation ecosystem

8186855 did my students see the first page of the hamodia this morning
8186856 did you see the article on the public examination which was organized by
8186857 listen to whats written here ill read it to you word by word
8186858 i want to ask you does anyone in this shiur think that the honor they showed me in the hall is true honor if there is somebody here who thinks that way he doesnt belong in my shiur
8186859 that day rav moshe had been asked a complicated halachic question and had toiled for several hours delving into the rishonim and acharonim in order to provide a clear answer however he didnt want to send them an answer until he heard my opinion
8186860 i ask you my dear talmidim what is the bigger kavod the
8186861 i wish i couldve had different news for giants fans but ive known for a while im done
8186862 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8186863 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8186864 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play
8186865 i really love my life now its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8186866 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8186867 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8186868 he thought maybe im not going to be as much of a help as i thought id be
8186869 if he cant put his best hall of fame talent on the field hes not going to play
8186870 we got all the talent in the world in this room regardless of if a guy got hurt or not we can replace we cant replace but you can make up from an osi with a kiwi
8186871 our job going into tuesday nights game was to try and get within four games of the red sox and get closer to chicago now were six back of the red sox were definitely digging ourselves a big trench to climb out of
8186872 we know we need to play better down the stretch
8186873 we were hoping the last 32 games wed have to play very well and win 22 games now we have 31 games left and have to win 22 still maybe even 23 we have to be really good down the stretch
8186874 a bunch of these teams were playing have given us problems this year
8186875 weve got five more with the red sox six more with
8186876 its possible we just have to see how he feels after tomorrows bullpen session
8186877 if he comes out all right thats what you talk about with the next step that he needs to see some hitters
8186878 there is time if we feel thats the right thing to do
8186879 the ball skipped up off the grass and i couldnt get a handle on it to throw it
8186880 i couldnt tell what timmons said so i went back to the umpire i didnt know if he called him safe or out
8186881 i knew crisp was flying because i saw him out of the corner of my eye so i just tried to stay back to make sure i could catch it i handled it it was just deep in my glove and i couldnt get it out thats why i was hoping he called him out
8186882 i saw the ball hit to third base and that it was deep and rodriguez was going to throw it over there i thought he might be out but i just kept going
8186883 the team emotionally was in a different place than we are this year
8186884 and when you win a game like that it really can make your season
8186885 obviously theres a lot of the season left to go this game doesnt get us to the playoffs and if we wouldve lost it wouldnt have knocked us out of the playoffs but as great as we feel right now the mets probably feel equally as bad
8186886 its designed for the hitter as long as youre in the right mentality
8186887 when you find your swing everything else comes back into play
8186888 youre a little more patient because you know where the ball has to be in order for you to hit it and then you know how to address the ball when youre searching for your swing you dont know what the heck you can and cant handle so youre just trying to do anything you can to put the bat on the ball
8186889 lets put it that way when youre able to take that and keep yourself motivated it helps
8186890 we zijn blij met de vrijlating van hu shigen maar het is tragisch dat hij zoveel jaren van mishandeling ernstige gezondheidsproblemen en slechte omstandigheden heeft moeten doorstaan
8186891 de mdc wil klaarblijkelijk niet deel uitmaken van de regering
8186892 ik ben niet echt tevreden met de manier waarop ik gespeeld heb
8186893 het is nooit makkelijk om het tegen een andere fran aise op te nemen tegen de estse kaia kanepi zal ik mijn niveau toch moeten opkrikken
8186894 daar ben ik wel blij om ik wilde kost wat kost niet tweemaal op rij van dezelfde speelster verliezen
8186895 het veld ligt vrij open niemand domineert het spel zoals dat vroeger het geval was daardoor mag ik opnieuw hoop koesteren om mee te spelen voor de grote prijzen nummer n worden is niet langer mijn doel daarvoor moet je veel spelen en dat doe ik niet meer de grand slams zijn veel belangrijker voor me
8186896 negatief nieuws vaak luider klinkt en langer nazindert dan correcte en genuanceerde informatie
8186897 heeft het niet gemakkelijk maar ondanks zware concurrentie uit lagelonenlanden met een aantal herstructureringen en sluitingen als gevolg blijft textiel in onze regio een hoogtechnologische sector veel bedrijven kunnen zich probleemloos meten met de grote spelers op wereldvlak

8186899 something i havent been able to do the past years go out and practice with no limitations

8186907 you must report your fears and explain why you want to apply for witness protection to the investigating officer in the case in which you are a witness the station commander at a police station the public prosecutor in the case the director of public prosecutions or to any official from the wpu
8186908 the function of the wpu is to take a person out of a place of danger it does not mean a person receives 24 hour protection except on the day when they appear in court to testify
8186909 then they are taken from their place of safety to court and back again
8186910 one of the biggest problems we face in the wpu programme is that some witnesses dislike the unfamiliarity of the safe zone and then without proper arrangements visit friends and family in the danger area
8186911 the witness is allowed to visit friends and family if they go through the proper channels
8186912 the only way we can apply the criminal justice system to its full strength is when people testify in court against those who have committed crimes
8186913 the national lotteries board confirms the conclusion of its disciplinary hearing conducted by an independent chairman

8186934 this is pretty grim analysis coming from the world bank
8186935 the urgency to act has never been greater especially in sub saharan africa where half the population of the continent lives in extreme poverty a figure that hasnt changed for over 25 years
8186936 poverty has fallen by about 1 per year since 1981
8186937 however the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts
8186938 wir werden in ein paar wochen sehen wo wir stehen
8186939 die usa haben sich wirklich geirrt wenn sie glauben dass sie wie im irak in der koreanischen demokratischen volksrepublik ganz nach belieben eine hausdurchsuchung machen k nnen
8186940 the government could get to the position of saying that looking at the overall economic development position of the country and the picture on energy use high speed rail is a sensible thing to do
8186941 if growth continues at its current rate then it could well be that we reach growth forecasts for 20 years time in 10 instead in which case all the capacity improvements planned in the rail white paper are exposed a lot sooner than expected
8186942 there is very little evidence that high speed rail links help regional performance
8186943 there is an argument for spending a lot more money on the existing low speed railway service there are not enough people making long journeys for high speed rail to make sense
8186944 we do not recognise virgins claims to be taking business from us on the grounds that passengers do not like terminal 5
8186945 against the backdrop of high oil prices and weakening consumer demand we are well placed to succeed over the coming months

8186960 this is a challenging job and i look forward to employing all my skills and experience for the benefit of the independent schools sector
8186961 i see close parallels between the work isc does for the independent schools sector and what the oecd offers member governments both organisations conduct research compile data and offer evidence based policy analysis for their members
8186962 the oecd is well known for its publications on education policy issues including the pisa study of student capabilities in which the uk independent sector scores some of the highest marks

8187084 music is supposed to be about intensity and feeling but theres no thinking behind the music thats out there today we want people to think to feel emotions again were always plugged in or connected to something part of the machine but the more we plug in the less human we become
8187085 we are living in an individualistic ego driven society that celebrates fame lacks ambiguity that is incapable of deep sustained attention with no discontinuity between life and art
8187086 life is an organic process of growth and decay and it is unavoidable in nature
8187087 we were essentially counted out by many our departure from warner brothers records only added to our determination not to let corporate decisions determine our artistic and creative voice after all thats what rock music is really all about believing in yourself overcoming adversity and taking that chance when the odds are against you

8187092 we had to go where the industry is thats expensive and time consuming weve basically toured for three and a half years and i think thats made us a much stronger band
8187093 nothing was given to us and i think that makes us a more genuine and honest group of people
8187094 were definitely a live band its the rawest form of a band its just us with all our guards down and guns blaring we love to play and i love to be on tour its almost sick how much i like to be on the road

8187100 maaf jika kalian menunggu lama karena hujan turun deras maka sungai menjadi banjir sehingga jembatannya hanyut dan saya tak bisa menyeberang alhamdulillah tiba tiba ada sebatang pohon yang tumbang kemudian pohon tersebut terpotong potong ranting dan dahannya dengan sendirinya sehingga jadi satu batang yang lurus hingga akhirnya menjadi perahu setelah itu baru saya bisa menyeberangi sungai dengan perahu tersebut
8187101 orang alim ini sudah gila rupanya masak pohon bisa jadi perahu dengan sendirinya mana bisa perahu jadi dengan sendirinya tanpa ada yang membuatnya
8187102 jika kalian percaya bahwa perahu tak mungkin ada tanpa ada pembuatnya kenapa kalian percaya bahwa bumi langit dan seisinya bisa ada tanpa penciptanya mana yang lebih sulit membuat perahu atau menciptakan bumi langit dan seisinya ini
8187103 jika tuhan itu ada mengapa dia tidak kelihatan di mana tuhan itu berada
8187104 ah mana ada sakit saya tidak melihat sakit di mana sakitnya
8187105 tidak saya tidak melihat sakit apakah para hadirin melihat sakitnya
8187106 nah meski kita tidak bisa melihat sakit bukan berarti sakit itu tidak ada begitu juga tuhan karena kita tidak bisa melihat tuhan bukan berarti tuhan itu tidak ada tuhan ada meski kita tidak bisa melihatnya tapi kita bisa merasakan ciptaannya
8187107 maha suci allah yang menjadikan di langit gugusan gugusan bintang dan dia menjadikan juga padanya matahari dan bulan yang bercahaya
8187108 dia lah yang menjadikan matahari bersinar dan bulan bercahaya dan ditetapkan nya manzilah manzilah tempat tempat bagi perjalanan bulan itu supaya kamu mengetahui bilangan tahun dan perhitungan waktu allah tidak menciptakan yang demikian itu melainkan dengan hak dia menjelaskan tanda tanda kebesaran nya kepada orang orang yang mengetahui
8187109 tidaklah mungkin bagi matahari mendapatkan bulan dan malampun tidak dapat mendahului siang dan masing masing beredar pada garis edarnya
8187110 allah lah yang meninggikan langit tanpa tiang sebagaimana yang kamu lihat kemudian dia bersemayam di atas arsy dan menundukkan matahari dan bulan masing masing beredar hingga waktu yang ditentukan allah mengatur urusan makhluk nya menjelaskan tanda tanda kebesaran nya supaya kamu meyakini pertemuan mu dengan tuhanmu
8187111 yaitu orang orang yang mengingat allah sambil berdiri atau duduk atau dalam keadaan berbaring dan mereka memikirkan tentang penciptaan langit dan bumi seraya berkata
8187112 maka terangkanlah kepadaku tentang nutfah yang kamu pancarkan kamukah yang menciptakannya atau kamikah yang menciptakannya
8187113 maka terangkanlah kepadaku tentang yang kamu tanam kamukah yang menumbuhkannya ataukah kami yang menumbuhkannya
8187114 sesungguhnya segala yang kamu seru selain allah sekali kali tidak dapat menciptakan seekor lalatpun walaupun mereka bersatu untuk menciptakannya dan jika lalat itu merampas sesuatu dari mereka tiadalah mereka dapat merebutnya kembali dari lalat itu amat lemahlah yang menyembah dan amat lemah pulalah yang disembah
8187115 o americans we have wasted billions of your tax dollars on an oppressive illegal terrorist regime
8187116 the physician or the researcher in the applied field has to have with him in session people who are not convinced with his efforts and direction so we would listen to the opposing opinions and there would be development in the study we hope that in the future we would reach that level
8187117 a researcher and scientist who have worked on their projects for months and for a long time when he is only given a chance to speak for 5 or 10 minutes this is not appropriate sometimes conferences are better organized in the form of forums or workshops where every group studies something separately and then the general audience can benefit through the media center or through the announced results
8187118 if the studies are abiding by scientific standards in a decisive manner then their results would be logical and convincing but if they do not abide by scientific and academic standards in a decisive fashion then there will be embarrassment to the muslims in front of american researchers because the matter of scientific production and research in america is at a high and advanced level
8187119 if we are to choose from among the studies those which the muslim scientists here have scrutinized very well and present them there then the participation of the muslim researchers would be an honorable one to islam and muslims the studies would be convincing leave a positive effect and cause a stir in the west otherwise if there was any leniency in adhering to these scientific standards and abiding by them it would cause the opposite reaction

8187125 you never know which part of the internet youll need the do you need sun cream part the whats the quickest way to the airport part the what about an ocean view room part or the can you really afford this part which is why all parts of the internet are on the iphone
8187126 we noted apples argument that the ad was about site availability rather than technical detail but considered the claims youll never know which part of the internet youll need and all parts of the internet are on the iphone implied users could access all websites and see them in their entirety
8187127 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8187128 we concluded the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone

8187139 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging
8187140 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community
8187141 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth

8187143 hes probably the best pitcher in baseball tonight he had a good night
8187144 its a team that can get you at any point so youve got to kind of be on your toes
8187145 you can never get too comfortable youve got to go out and still be aggressive you cant change your game plan too much but i think theres a point with teams like this that theyre never out of it its a tough team to pitch again
8187146 when doc is on the mound youve just got to scratch out a few runs and youve got a chance to win
8187147 hes one of the premier pitchers in the league i thought i pitched pretty well tonight but when youre facing halladay youve got to be in your a game

8187159 we are talking to the uae government about what we can do with nuclear energy we certainly have engaged in discussions
8187160 it is central to our strategy and that of the abu dhabi government that our capital market continues to evolve to meet the ever growing needs of retail and institutional investors both national and international
8187161 adx has been encouraging the establishment of more collective investment schemes in the uae and etfs are an excellent model for this market they offer investors a portfolio of securities that imitates the performance of a particular market or index with just one trade investors could have exposure to a wide variety of securities
8187162 because there is very limited experience of etfs locally it is important for us to hear and learn from international experts we can examine how others have done it and agree on the appropriate mechanisms and regulatory infrastructure for adx
8187163 whereas the diplomatic and military ai in previous total war games were separate entities leading to some curious international actions they have now been unified which should result in more realistic diplomatic relations more useful alliances and complex treaties
8187164 this is how it works youre young until youre not you love until you dont you try until you cant you laugh until you cry you cry until you laugh and everyone must breathe until their dying breath
8187165 he had so much fun riding the rides with us
8187166 i remember laughing as we rode the log ride and screaming as we rode the big dipper for my first roller coaster experience
8187167 unfortunately he died a year later but i will always remember him acting like a big kid that day with us
8187168 oh what fun riding chartered buses from the town square to geauga lake
8187169 the kids would always be on the lookout to see who would be first to see the big dipper ahead
8187170 we told our mothers after the fact and it was then that my mother realized i was getting too big for the kiddie rides
8187171 during the slow times i would visit the fun house with its wooden slides large wavy mirrors and spinning circle
8187172 the big dipper roller coaster the bumper cars the various rides and the games of skill were free with an employees pass
8187173 it was there at geauga lake park that my widowed mother met and married the park security policeman
8187174 after standing in line the two of us flew around the track
8187175 upon disembarking i noted that my boyfriends face was greener than my blouse
8187176 although the rides are gone i will always retain the memories of that day

8187179 i had no idea anyone was going to die the only person i thought was going to be killed was pj and then myself i thought blue was going to kill pj
8187180 my head was telling me its not going to work but i still loved him
8187181 im not trying to blacken blues character but his good points were overtaken by the fact he was constantly on cocaine
8187182 i did say at the beginning of the fight he deserved a few punches but i never thought he deserved to die my whole flat was getting destroyed and i hit blue over the head with a wine bottle and it shattered i had the bottle neck in my hand blue was on top of pj and i hit him again i think i probably hit him about three times
8187183 can i thank the party for this the gold medal of the liberal democrats olympics
8187184 i am delighted that tavish scott has been chosen as the new leader of the scottish liberal democrats
8187185 he will bring energy and enthusiasm to the role taking the fight to the snp and labour right across scotland
8187186 the liberal democrats are the only party who represent all of scotland urban and rural east and west highland island and lowland
8187187 tavish will address the issues that matter most to the people of scotland not the narrow minded squabbles of the nationalists and labour
8187188 we congratulate tavish on his election as the lib dem leader
8187189 he will have a tough job as he takes over the reins of scotlands fourth party especially since scottish politics is now a three horse race
8187190 there is no alternative to a custodial sentence the court requires to mark the seriousness of the offences and to deter others
8187191 she was screaming as the accused used the stun gun a further three times on her back and the top of her thigh she could feel the hot and jaggy pain of the tazer
8187192 this is a tragic set of circumstances because of inexcusable failure to secure windows and an old lady died
8187193 in our opinion if she was that determined to get out she would have done
8187194 whether it was because she was upset or she panicked and thought there had been a fire alarm we will never know
8187195 it is an awful lot of money but i suppose you have to take loss of life seriously
8187196 when i speak respond with the first word you think of one
8187197 what this government has also done in that area as its done across the government is weve instituted an expenditure management system where over a period of five years we comprehensively review every program and we make sure that were spending on priorities and spending on those programs that are most effective
8187198 some programs in arts and culture have increased in funding others have gone down in total its gone up
8187199 to fall into the fallacy that its really about moving money around well it isnt
8187200 as a magnet for talent an enhancer of economic performance and a catalyst for prosperity
8187201 the rumours and speculation and information from sources arent what were going to deal with
8187202 were going to deal with facts that we find through our investigation
8187203 those kinds of questions will definitely be asked and will be answered
8187204 i feel very confident that our correctional facilities are able to house individuals
8187205 having said that i need to know and i will find out in the course of the investigation what happened in this particular case because we do have a secure unit that was breached in some way shape or form for these inmates to get out and that is of grave concern to me
8187206 ich gehe davon aus dass die rzte auch an einer l sung interessiert sind auch die krankenkassen
8187207 wir gehen an den verhandlungstisch mit der klaren erwartungshaltung vom neutralen schlichter ein deutlich verbessertes angebot vorgelegt zu bekommen
8187208 id see women going in the back of the house all the time
8187209 i was shocked to hear about the allegations brought against mr meinzer effective immediately he has been suspended without pay from my office until such time as the matter has been dealt with by the proper authorities in a court of law
8187210 i think you have to go in with a game plan and youre definitely aware that its a team that can get you at any point and you have to be on your toes you can never get too comfortable theyre a tough team to pitch against
8187211 its real nice especially picking up the fourth run and after you get that you have a two run lead and you can get comfortable and we added on two more so those are huge
8187212 it takes a lot of pressure off those guys coming in the late innings its nice to pick up a couple of runs for them the bullpen to work with
8187213 ill take hits whenever i can get them and its obviously even better when theres runners in scoring position
8187214 ive gone through three spring trainings now because of his two injuries so it has been a learning experience
8187215 the big thing is to try to go up and when you get your pitch dont miss it
8187216 if you can do that more times than not you can be successful
8187217 fifteen days isnt going to bring my range back to where it was but ive tried to make some adjustments while ive been out
8187218 about three weeks ago a month ago i was throwing some false positives out there because i wasnt sure he could still perform where i was and i knew i couldnt get to the baseball
8187219 i knew i had worked as hard as i could work and i couldnt get to the baseball that doesnt give you much confidence but i think i can get to the baseball now and im excited about it
8187220 i lowered my hands and tried to take some stress off my shoulder from where ive held the bat in the past
8187221 i shortened my load timing mechanism a little bit so that my shoulder doesnt go outside the range that i have
8187222 its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regime after some years of neglect
8187223 as you know in the recent budget we put considerably more inspectors and resources into this
8187224 obviously we want to make sure that the companies maintain their responsibilities and that we fully review all the facts here to understand what went wrong and how we can prevent it in the future
8187225 it is proven to be effective but people dont like using it
8187226 weve shown it gets transferred to the next 100 slices or more about 90 per cent of the transfer occurred in the first 10 slices
8187227 we dont swab for listeria any more the industry does all that themselves
8187228 they just document all this stuff we read their reports if their reports say they do everything fine then they do everything fine
8187229 its like in aviation we cant look under each jet engine of an airline but we can make sure the maintenance service works
8187230 all i can say is that with the new system that has been set up theres always an adjustment phase
8187231 we expect the companies to be responsible and not just go through the motions to placate the inspectors
8187232 by the time they finish doing the paperwork theyve got very little time to actually look at anything and it bothers them
8187233 the fact is listeria needs a very high dose how did such meat products get contaminated with such a high level of listeria in order to cause so much illness it needs over a billion cells to actually cause illness
8187234 rather than prematurely writing off the idea its important to critically study municipal networks successes and shortcomings as weve written about before america generally lags behind the rest of the developed world in broadband penetration and speeds and we ought to be exploring many different solutions both private and public to bring fast affordable internet access to everyone

8187241 norm also a norm in working class groups within the class ridden settler society that have had the most regular contact with aborigines then how can it be expected that a destructive tradition passed down over several generations now could be considered as anything else but
8187242 why do mccarthyists always have to turn up at these threads the topic is about anything but what

8187250 now that the the intervention has had the sneaky land grab and other right wing elements removed im hoping
8187251 most white men dont tend to get driven that far
8187252 but it did give my mother an excuse to go shopping for sex toys
8187253 and men do like to assert power over others indeed theyre alive
8187254 white men get driven and act in particularly large and nasty ways they just cover their explosive tracks better
8187255 im kinda one nation amp i dont mean the obama kind more like brit national front kind
8187256 wasnt the james hardie episode epitomised in the example of bernie banton for example the evidence of a barbarian savagery every bit as crass as anything a drunken black person does during a friday night brawl

8187263 it is just one year but it does suggest that womens efforts to get more education and to be even more committed to employment may be paying off

8187266 were concerned that the data were seeing today reflect a high water mark
8187267 the indicators for 2008 suggest that a year from now the income and poverty data will be much grimmer for california
8187268 people earning low amounts for doing housekeeping or landscaping or for busing dishes they might not live in the city of san jose because its a high cost area
8187269 we know the economy has continued to grow with jobs at the top and at the bottom
8187270 where were weak is in the middle thats one reason why were excited about the opportunity with tesla
8187271 whats closing the gap is mens relatively flat earnings over time and womens rising earnings
8187272 mens earnings now are really no different than they were in the early 70s in real terms

8187291 we had been expecting the raids either on the coast or in hattiesburg we were getting information that ice was in hotels in the coast and other preparations were going on in hattiesburg
8187292 most of what we are getting today is that ice is focusing on jones county but havent had calls from all areas we have had calls from chicken plants in and around laurel we had expected the raids to occur at chicken plants it was a surprise its a different industry howard industries gets state and federal funding to operate

8187299 it would have to be a rather pathetic celebrity who was ticked off because they didnt get a photo with obama
8187300 but her video went way beyond the pale it invites the kind of mccain attacks nobody wants
8187301 my father was a drive in theater manager he had seven kids and barely made a living many actors are from working class families unlike mccain i can count the number of homes one
8187302 the mccain people find the strength and cut it down

8187305 confidence in oneself and confidence in ones country are not the same
8187306 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression

8187412 it is only in the past 15 years that ive come to appreciate what a great actor he is now i see my father in me every day i see his looks and i see his acting style i am my fathers son

8187423 i am delighted that the independent sector will have access to davids impressive experience and abilities

8187425 this is a challenging job and i look forward to employing all my skills and experience for the benefit of the independent schools sector
8187426 i see close parallels between the work isc does for the independent schools sector and what the oecd offers member governments both organisations conduct research compile data and offer evidence based policy analysis for their members
8187427 the oecd is well known for its publications on education policy issues including the pisa study of student capabilities in which the uk independent sector scores some of the highest marks

8187439 will leave gatwick unfit for purpose for the olympic period and beyond
8187440 gatwick is going to be a major gateway into this country for the olympics second only to heathrow and we need a fast efficient and effective rail network to move people around it would be a major disappointment if we only get the concourse improvements before 2012
8187441 we need the track signalling and platform improvements for the long term future of gatwick as part of ensuring that its growth from 35 5 million passengers a year to a predicted 40 million by 2015 is as sustainable as possible
8187442 that means we need to encourage more people across the south east and beyond to leave their cars at home and use public transport for journeys to the airport
8187443 it surely also makes much more sense to complete all the work needed at gatwick as a single package instead of adopting a piecemeal approach completing the full scheme at the same time is also going to minimise disruption
8187444 we have looked at what the government requires at gatwick

8187453 to be able to record this single with the support of so many talented musicians especially gioia bruno is a dream come true i look forward to putting together my second album over the coming months and experimenting more with my own original works and collaborations
8187454 i was excited to do background vocals and ad lib for win on kiss amp tell the project took on a fascinating new direction when i was approached to sing money talks dirty cash so it could be meshed with the track
8187455 ill admit it was a thrill to sing it as i have always loved the adventures of stevie v version approaching the vocal in my lower register gave it a much sexier vibe than the original personally ive never been all about the money like the title suggests so my performance on the track is an irreverent interpretation

8187488 the board remains convinced of the fundamental value of the business over the medium and long term and our primary focus is to amend certain of the existing borrowing agreements
8187489 to this end the group is engaged in constructive dialogue and is not aware of any issues which would prevent these amendments being finalized by the end of this year
8187490 the current operating environment in the u k housing market remains very challenging and we do not anticipate any recovery in the short term

8187493 with cut backs in music education our children no longer are learning the music of their heritage
8187494 as america grows more diverse learning the music of our history and our country is an important way to bind us all together as americans were hoping events like todays bring attention not only to the national anthem but to music education in our schools nationwide
8187495 not knowing the national anthem is a symptom of a larger problem in our school systems
8187496 research shows music education at an early age greatly increases the likelihood a child will grow up to seek higher education earn a higher salary and feel more personally fulfilled

8187503 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level
8187504 this was a relatively cool summer and to have ice decrease to the second lowest minimum on record demonstrates that global warmings ongoing impact is profound
8187505 its going to accelerate climate change through changes in the reflectance of the arctic

8187510 you want people to think well of you dont you
8187511 our evidence indicates the earliest inhabitants of palau were of normal stature and it counters the evidence that berger et al presented in their paper indicating there was a reduced stature population in early palau
8187512 our research from whole bones and whole skeletons indicates that the earliest individuals in palau were of normal stature but gracile in other words they were thin
8187513 i think bergers primary mistakes were his not understanding the variation in the skeletal population in which he was working using fragmentary remains again in a situation where he didnt understand variation and stepping outside his own area of expertise which i think all scientists try not to do but sometimes we do
8187514 although we have not seen the material that berger et al base their results on we can speak to the diversity and normalcy of human skeletal series from throughout the archipelago that have been excavated from several burial caves over the last decade as well as the an abundance of archaeological linguistic and historical data indicating a general continuity of cultural traits over a period of three millennia
8187515 archaeological data also do not suggest a separate isolated group evolving differently biologically or culturally although there are subtle differences and changes that occur through time
8187516 had bergers team compared their scant dental metric data with those of other regions in the pacific or elsewhere in the world they would have seen that large teeth are not uncommon in early peoples of these regions
8187517 he did not take the time to understand the area in which he was working its entire history not just the skeletal stuff
8187518 any time you work anywhere you have to understand this history you just cant walk in and cowboy it pull some stuff out and draw conclusions in the absence of understanding the bigger picture

8187524 it is inappropriate and offensive to compare any current or former world leaders with the man ultimately responsible for the death of six million jews and the suffering of countless others during the holocaust doing so trivializes the history of the holocaust and is an insult to the memories of the victims and their families

8187717 auch heuer werden wieder rund 10 000 wohnungen in wien mit unterst tzung aus mitteln der wiener wohnbauf rderung saniert durch die f rderungen setzen wir f r private hauseigent mer nicht nur anreize ihre h user zu revitalisieren sondern wir gew hrleisten damit auch die einhaltung hoher qualit tsstandards dabei steht die verbesserung des wohnkomforts und die steigerung der energieeffizienz der geb ude im mittelpunkt
8187718 besonders thermisch energetische sanierungen bringen eine deutliche ersparnis beim heizw rmebedarf und damit auch bei den heizkosten mit sich diese sind jedoch f r die hauseigent merinnen und hauseigent mer mit einem gr eren aufwand verbunden daher gibt es seit dem jahr 2000 eine spezielle thewosan f rderschiene
8187719 es handelt sich hierbei um ein typisches 60er jahre wohnhaus das ber keine architektonischen besonderheiten verf gt durch die thermisch energetische sanierung konnte der heizw rmebedarf des geb udes der rund 114 3 kilowattstunden pro quadratmeter und jahr betrug auf beeindruckende 29 8 kilowattstunden gesenkt werden und entspricht nun dem ausgezeichneten standard eines niedrigenergiehauses
8187720 durch betr chtliche f rdermittel und durch sehr viel informations und beratungsarbeit die der wohnfonds wien die gebietsbetreuungen stadterneuerung und die bezirksvertretungen leisten versuchen wir noch mehr private hauseigent merinnen und hauseigent mer ins boot zu holen und f r eine thewosan sanierung zu gewinnen mit erfolg denn allein in ottakring gibt es viele weitere projekte f r thermisch energetische sanierungen
8187721 eine tatsache die mich als bezirksvorsteher nat rlich besonders freut

8187765 business enterprises run by religious groups range from pizza chains insurance companies wineries farms schools hospitals and aged care facilities all are exempt from tax australia is one of the few countries in the world where religious groups are not forced to pay tax on business ventures
8187766 the argument is a compelling one and it goes something like this religious bodies and charities are not taxed so religion can run businesses and not for profit organisations in the guise of charity these charities run as businesses and employing thousands make and are given huge amounts of money that are churned back into the organisation how is that different from any other business well precisely because it isnt like another business the turnover is not the object personal gain is not the object the object is community good that should be justification enough for not taxing such organisations
8187767 true religious bodies and their affiliated not for profit organisations employ large numbers of people the catholic church for example employs about 100 000 people but it is indicative of the nature of this argument that most of those people are teachers and nurses and other medical staff in fact once the church employed very few personnel because the work was done by unpaid religious but times have changed and the operations of the church have become of necessity business like
8187768 they also have become part of the mainstream fabric of society in a way they were not 100 years ago so for example some of the best hospitals in this country are run by religious institutions and most of them are public hospitals such as st vincents in sydney and of course one third of australian children catholic and non catholic are educated in catholic diocesan schools which are part of the mainstream education system although they receive government funding they save the taxpayer an enormous amount since they are funded at less than half of what it costs to educate a child in a state school non diocesan schools receive even less
8187769 large religiously based charities such as the st vincent de paul society mission australia and the salvation army run everything from homeless shelters to youth outreach and aged care facilities and lately the government even expects them to find jobs for the unemployed these charities are financed by a mixture of donations government support and their own businesses such as the famous op shops would australians seriously want the op shops taxed
8187770 the sanitarium company which makes weet bix is operated by the seventh day adventist church it earns millions surely it should pay tax this is a slightly grey area however even if sanitarium were officially taxed in effect the company would not end up paying any tax because all profits go back into the church and it partly funds things such as the sydney adventist hospital the san
8187771 so if we tax religion we must tax the secular association too and the humanist society and all the rest of the anti religionists of course the anti religionists dont make much money but then they dont have to they are not running hospitals schools orphanages old peoples homes they dont generally organise themselves to go around at night in a van picking up drunks and taking them to matt talbot theyd rather tax the proceeds of the silver circle at the talbot
8187772 so by all means lets have a charities commission that weeds out bogus charities such as those set up by rich athletes to further enrich themselves lets make sure that the money does go where it is supposed to since this is really the point but please dont let secularist ex senators lyn allison and andrew murray try to pretend that charity can be assessed like any other business

8187789 he was the picture of confidence but in some ways confidence itself and confidence in ones country are not the same
8187790 of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8187791 confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
8187792 la prochaine mx 5 sera un grand pas en avant la derni re est beaucoup trop conservatrice et nous ne pouvons plus nous permettre cela nous devons lui donner plus de caract re plus de virilit
8187793 lors du dernier tour de table o les meilleures sketchs sont soumis aux chefs nous sommes venus avec des propositions plut t radicales et il se pourrait que lune dentre elles soit choisie
8187794 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8187795 we will have to react of course in a military way
8187796 this further inflames an already tense situation in the region it is unacceptable
8187797 we played badly and i was really disappointed with the performance and the players know that and they know they can improve
8187798 we can improve on everything from the first leg everything i was really disappointed with how we played
8187799 we have confidence that we can beat anyone at anfield but we know they can play good counter attacking football we know they are well organised and we know that we need to score more than once just in case
8187800 but if we somehow manage to get through it will rank as the biggest shock by a belgian side in europe for 40 years
8187801 all i keep hearing is how poorly liverpool are playing at the moment but when i looked at the premier league table on saturday night im pretty sure they were top with maximum points thats some poor start
8187802 i have been in their position many times in the past when you are the smaller team against the bigger team and have nothing to lose
8187803 you know you can play without pressure and the players go out there to do their best and enjoy it its more difficult for the bigger team
8187804 im not nervous though you try and concentrate and think what advice you can give to the players i dont really get nervous before a game it is more tension that anything else
8187805 if you consider the other teams we faced in other champions league qualifiers then yes standard are the best
8187806 yes we were lucky in the first leg they had a goal disallowed they missed a penalty and we did not create any chances their manager said that to win they will have to do everything perfectly and we will have to be very bad and it will be a fantastic achievement for them if they go through but for me it wouldnt be a massive surprise they are a good team
8187807 if you analyse the games they have played together the last one was much better in terms of understanding
8187808 the team did not play well and because neither player scored some people will talk but you could see they had better movement and some passes together
8187809 mbokani is a good striker he has pace and ability so we need to be strong in defence
8187810 we also know that they kept a clean sheet at the weekend and that they are good at the back also so we will need to improve our attacking
8187811 it was just a bad day and we are thinking about qualifying at anfield
8187812 i am not a hero for the penalty in the first match i have just done my job for me the penalty was just a part of it
8187813 for liverpool the champions league is a huge competition and it would be a disaster not to get through
8187814 nobody in the squad is thinking about anything other than qualifying i am always optimistic and i am convinced we will beat standard
8187815 wij zijn het met jullie eens dat het jammer is dat het historische stukje brug verloren is echter wij gaan dit niet compenseren door het beeld aan te kopen
8187816 im pleased to report that technological advances by romelia bocci inc have created a much higher degree of efficieny in operations this means big profits for most middle east e gaming development related companies and their subsidiaries
8187817 output of middle east e gaming development related products will nearly double overhead will decrease by 1 3 and employee salaries will increase by 15
8187818 for the past five years there has been a noticable trade imbalance between the usa and other nations working within the middle east e gaming development market particularly in operations and human capital the recent advances however will help mend this rift and keep more dollars on shore i expect to see demand for labor increase in the long run with additional long run profits for strong middle east e gaming development usa companies that move forward
8187819 the recent news in the middle east e gaming development industry means big things for us including the need to expand our physical building and operations well be able to hire an additional and much needed 100 new employees who will help push our efforts forward this is going to be great
8187820 to keep things fair for all parties were going to begin a general auction for our new products within 30 days anyone who wants in and we know that almost everyone does will have an opportunity to bid on the product first dibs go to the top 3 companies who will enjoy a 90 period free of competition from other middle east e gaming development entities once this period expires other companies can access our new technology and use it as they see fit
8187821 im getting calls from middle east e gaming development industry executives investors and general employees all asking about what is going on and if they can provide information for the news agency of course they want their names mentioned so that a little publicity is given to their particular middle east e gaming development company but it does save me from hunting these people down and taking interviews

8187910 theres so much talent that never sees the light of day because of the traditional way we discover artists i felt it was time to take music back where it belongs in the streets and with the people

8187919 any win is nice but it wasnt to be tonight we wont dwell on it too long we move on
8187920 they probably deserved the victory on the night and good luck to them for us it was disappointing but we move on listen we have got a squad we are in the premier league now and it is a squad of players that you have got to trust
8187921 if you cant make changes we shouldnt have them they shouldnt be on our books we made changes because it was international week last week the premier league is our bread and butter and we are looking forward to every game we didnt get the result but if we play as well as we did on saturday week in week out we will be fine
8187922 we looked organised in the first half but it all went out of the window in the second half we lost our shape and discipline and goalkeeper matt duke kept us in it as a collective the team was far too disorganised and dishevelled in the second half and we lost the game it was a cup tie tonight and the shoe was on the other foot for us but we didnt wear it well
8187923 it was a great night the players were magnificent and i was delighted for everybody
8187924 overall i thought we deserved to go through but we want to keep it going as we know how quickly things can change in football it does not concern me who we get in the next round as long as it is a good draw
8187925 i like the way that we got some rhythm and fluency to our play
8187926 the clean sheet was a good confidence booster for the whole club weve scored nine goals and were looking to play with flair and rhythm im not going to go overboard with this as it is still very early in the season and people are trying to find their form

8187971 in some programs one third of the money raised for an album goes to some company that devised the model and theres nothing left for marketing much less a video in a band with a plan every penny goes to finance the album and video and ensures they get heard and seen and instead of just asking fans to donate as some artists have done were inviting them to hop on board on our little engine that could and go with us on the ride
8187972 the fans involvement motivates us to make our best music and to go to any length to ensure it gets heard it becomes a group effort and therefore a group success imagine seeing us winning an award or playing on your favorite tv program you can say i am part of that

8188061 io e alcuni miei amici siamo usciti dallo stadio e ci siamo recati verso un parcheggio situato nei pressi dellolimpico allimprovviso mentre mi trovavo vicino alla mia auto sono stato aggredito alle spalle da una ventina di tifosi laziali che avevano cinture catene e bastoni ho notato che alcuni avevano il volto coperto ho ricevuto sette coltellate di cui sei sotto la spalla sinistra e una al gluteo quando sono caduto a terra il gruppo di tifosi ha continuato a picchiarmi con calci e schiaffi fortunatamente sono giunti alcuni supporter beneventani facendo spaventare e scappare i teppisti

8188092 after reading countless reviews of this place i had to take my sushi loving booty here
8188093 and he says yeah but youre just average if you were any good the yankees wouldve traded for you
8188094 i sat there waiting for the punch line like this kids 8 years old is he serious but he had just gotten that off the video games where hed ask me the question why the yankees were so good and i would tell him that they spent a lot of money and traded for good players
8188095 it was definitely one of my highlights when eric wedge gave me the ball and no one really understood why he gave me the ball and thought it was a mistake
8188096 we had a cy young winner over there cc sabathia ready to go and so he handed me the ball and i was able to get a win for my team and i felt really good
8188097 it was about 10 15 feet over there i got a lot of champagne poured on me so its a pretty nice memory
8188098 it was a pretty special father son moment for me we laugh about it now hes getting ready to be 11
8188099 well i hope hes a great fit for a series like this but the reason we got him was to win games for us whenever he is pitching
8188100 his personality on a stage like this hell be more excited to pitch under these circumstances instead of backing down because of nervousness or anything like that that doesnt guarantee that hell win but hell be excited about this
8188101 now i take the hill in a series ive always watched on tv and thought man what would it be like to wear a uniform and be involved in such a great series and such a great rivalry
8188102 for me to all of a sudden magically have red sox written across my chest and take the field in such a big game and a big series i cant wait its going to be a lot of fun

8188108 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8188109 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
8188110 it was obviously maybe the biggest pitch in the game
8188111 we got ourselves in a position where one pitch can turn the game around and masterson comes in and makes one pitch and gets out of the inning that was huge
8188112 in my respects hes a good righthanded hitter and when im called upon im supposed to get the job done i won that time
8188113 obviously i love that stuff thats why you play the game
8188114 we dont panic here you hit the panic button you just get worse right right
8188115 lou cucuzza the clubhouse guy got me some dirt from the mound its pretty special playing in this league the last 14 15 years and pitching here for such a long period of time its such a cathedral of sports
8188116 to walk the hallowed grounds that such great players before us have played their game and walked and ran and hit its pretty special
8188117 thats about as big a situation as youre going to find poise is not a problem he deserves to be used in those situations
8188118 that was probably what we were hoping for getting one pitch and getting out of that inning is the best case scenario he made a very good pitch and we got out of that inning

8188145 its better not as stiff moving around im still getting a little guarding when i sit down try to stand up and get into extension things like that signs that were going in the right direction but maybe dont want to go out there and swing right yet and blow something up again
8188146 its been really weird that was some of the questions the reasons we got the mri see why its kind of lingering and hanging around versus going away i also did it in japan stuck around for two or three days then it was gone this ones been kind of relentless for a little over a week
8188147 he threw 50 pitches and he was strong and hes ready to go friday im excited and because hes excited so are we

8188152 i think its something that ill be able to play through the season with and then well reevaluate in the offseason

8188156 no there are reasons why we havent included a keyboard controller not all of our songs have keyboard parts so we didnt want someone to come into a game pick up the keyboard controller and then have nothing to do in any of the songs that are selected we wanted a big mix of music in world tour and adding a keyboard controller would either have limited our choices or the players a keyboard controller deserves to be introduced with its own game this is something were thinking about

8188235 despite the allegations that theres amaster disc thats not the case and allegations that psystar has somehow modified mac os xs code to run on non apple systems thats also not the case
8188236 there is no modification of any proprietary code of apples
8188237 we purchase copies of mac os directly from apple or from an apple authorized dealer
8188238 no specific precedent but we wouldnt be filing this if we didnt believe we could support it

8188279 i must say the moldovan had the best defence among all the boxers in beijing he never dropped his guard during the bout
8188280 on the other hand akhil is a very fearless boxer and he plays with his guards down but thats his style technically there was no problem
8188281 he is a very emotional person and was really affected by the quarterfinal loss but put up a brave face to keep the spirits up in the camp he said so what if i have lost jitender and vijender have to accomplish the task and he kept himself upbeat for them
8188282 he always had the confidence and he now has the required experience and that made all the difference in 2012 he can definitely go for the gold
8188283 things are looking upward for the indian boxers as you can see the way jitender 51 kg fought it is one of the best olympics for any boxer
8188284 earlier we were seventh in the asian rankings and now we are fourth and if we had not missed these two bronze we would have been on top india has massive talent pool in boxing
8188285 thats the plan so far lets see how things go from here

8188305 es waren die russen die anfingen sie sind in der nacht auf freitag einmarschiert nur deshalb stie en georgische streitkr fte nach s dossetien vor um den russen den nachschub abzuschneiden
8188306 russland hat die er ffnung der olympischen spiele dazu genutzt um sozusagen in ihrem windschatten einzumarschieren
8188307 wir wollten die russischen truppen vor den georgischen d rfern stoppen als unsere panzer nach zchinwali einr ckten haben die russen die stadt bombardiert sie und nicht wir haben zchinwali in tr mmern gelegt

8188314 i think were getting caught up in past practice instead of what might be better
8188315 what weve seen is a very weak economic recovery this decade
8188316 all of the indicators are moving in the wrong direction
8188317 this will be the last good year in a long time
8188318 in terms of seeing evidence of a decrease of people living in poverty we havent seen it
8188319 the number has gotten a little better for santa cruz county because weve had some innovative programs like healthy kids
8188320 one of the things falling by the wayside though is employer sponsored health insurance and then a lot of people are losing their jobs
8188321 the only two places youre going to be is at home or at school if you are enrolled in classes
8188322 anti western especially anti american mood obviously increases in central asia
8188323 researches on relations and regulations of central eurasian societal attitude toward stable regional progress and understanding among nations in global world are very important nowadays
8188324 another reason of high importance is that nobody has been researching opinion of students kyrgyz decision makers of tomorrow about geopolitics and west
8188325 kyrgyzstan has a weight of regional security responsibility which depends on russia usa relations and on opinions of kyrgyz citizens toward these countries that is why kyrgyzstan announced its decision on democratic development and balanced foreign policy this statement is based on politicians opinions that if kyrgyzstan looses the balance between the west east north and south it might turn into humanitarian disaster in means of sovereignty loss and armed conflicts
8188326 existing tendency of misbalance toward russia and china cannot be ignored kyrgyzstan should strive for freedom from being a wish performer of its giant neighbors political moods
8188327 misbalance of asian countries in international relations are not only a consequence but also a cause of their weakness unfortunately beginning from 2005 kyrgyzstan misbalances toward traditional region occupants china russia and islamic world the cause is not only in politicians and religious activists deeds but it is also a pro russian attitude of most politicians they also support the shanghai cooperation organization sco strengthening whether western politicians hope for old and new political interests will prevail over common interest toward the u s is still a question besides so far the united states did not make a clear statement about long run programs in central asia in the role of occupants the reason is that this region is not included in prior interests of the usa
8188328 my suggestion is that they either use the proceeds from the sale to pay that debt or that they use redevelopment funds as they become available
8188329 i just dont think that its good practice to be planning to use general fund money into the future to pay off that debt
8188330 at some point that pool clearly needs to be replaced
8188331 you cant do a flip turn in the shallow end without risking your scalp
8188332 that would be like using my 401k to pay off my mortgage

8188338 i have received many complaints from the chinese community over the statement for the past two days

8188340 i know he was canvassing for votes during the recent by election but he didnt have to resort to using a racist statement
8188341 its insensitive to talk about other races like this we want him to retract the statement and we will demand an apology from him

8188409 i love fulham football club and i want to stay here and play for fulham
8188410 now im playing im just enjoying every minute of it
8188411 i know how close i was to not being able to play again to be honest so every time i step on that pitch i just try and enjoy 90 minutes of football
8188412 at one point it was have another operation or hang your boots up i stuck in there and did the rehab and i cant thank the surgeon dr steadman enough he got my leg back to where it was and if not stronger
8188413 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8188414 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again
8188415 the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20 degrees and it rains rains rains
8188416 in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather
8188417 in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8188418 its not only the weather that im not happy about here
8188419 in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel the joy of life
8188420 throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8188421 the only time to meet friends is at weekends but for football players its the busiest time of all
8188422 it was much easier for me to adapt to russia than england in england i had no one to talk to
8188423 there is no change in the itinerary bangalore will host the first test

8188429 were actively looking like anyone this week is notorious for things being done and well have to see what happens
8188430 were jostling around like other clubs are were under pressure as were short at the back because of injury
8188431 that has left us a bit stretched ive made my feelings known about transfers we need to back up the squad if we can
8188432 michael owen is not only one player he is a very special player
8188433 he is very important to this football club and my vision for it and if other people do not share that it is their problem
8188434 i do not say these things publicly for any other reason than i believe it
8188435 i know the kind of people you need at a football club
8188436 james has a three year contract i do not even want to talk about losing him
8188437 i thought he was nearly our player last week against the dogs in what he did
8188438 its no coincidence that the team has been running a lot better with him at six
8188439 finch is a big talker a few of us boys will have to step up and be pretty dominant this week
8188440 it is probably my biggest test this week but as hagesy said ive just got to do the little things ive been doing but be a little bit more dominant because finchys gone
8188441 they give you a lot of confidence when you do something right and theyre into you when you do something wrong
8188442 im really enjoying first grade now and getting a feel for it
8188443 playing a few games in a row has actually given me a bit more confidence week by week
8188444 hopefully that will settle down and allow him to play the last game but well have to work around that this week
8188445 nobody is really buying anything the us dollar is worthless
8188446 it looks as though it will give us a little more prominence than we would have had
8188447 everybody in this country is going to know where delaware is
8188448 joe always got some respect and some attention at other conventions but this time it s full speed ahead
8188449 there was nobody in the hall except the whole delaware delegation came over
8188450 this is the biggest thing that s happened in delaware politically that i can remember
8188451 our senior senator has just been selected to be vice president you can t come up with a better scenario to energize the party to come out to vote and get involved in this election
8188452 more than in most states delaware has a closeness to its politicians and a pride for anything that comes from delaware
8188453 to have seen joe biden whom we know very well live on tv saturday it gives you goosebumps
8188454 joe was considered a brash upstart but he pulled it out
8188455 we re really proud of him he s worked hard he s a scrapper and it s paid off it would be great if he and barack obama win
8188456 one thing s for sure people won t be saying dela where anymore
8188457 my uncle asked me to be here because this is so important to our family
8188458 this is the event where you ve seen many of us grow up
8188459 it s been an amazing 24 hours for our family and it s all thanks to you for good and bad we now get to share our joe biden with the country
8188460 at 10 a m saturday the phone rang and it was joe biden
8188461 he was getting ready to leave for the airport and he said he called to check in on how ben was doing at william amp mary
8188462 that says a lot about joe biden for him it s family first family second and family third
8188463 my former boss he s responsible for my wife and i getting married
8188464 this just made my day people are just so excited this is a historic ticket with obama as the first black presidential nominee
8188465 this will create a higher profile for the state during the campaign joe will certainly talk about us during the campaign
8188466 when you come from delaware and get asked to be vice president you have to be that much better than other candidates because you re coming from a small state
8188467 this gives delaware the presence we deserve joe has worked hard for our state in washington for many years
8188468 he s a great campaigner he can rouse up an audience
8188469 he s got great union support and blue collar roots he s a strong advocate for women s rights which will help with hillary clinton supporters
8188470 when you saw him this time he was thoughtful and gave great answers
8188471 the only sensible politician who would do that would have to have bulletproof evidence that obama biden is going to win
8188472 i ve always said i want to be governor and i m going to keep working to get the nomination and get elected
8188473 i will do everything i can to help sen biden win re election and election to vice president
8188474 in the meantime i remain totally focused on my own race to win the nomination for governor
8188475 in addition mobile phone manufacturers will be put under pressure to maintain healthy margins while they intend to further break through in the emerging markets to increase sales

8188483 the problem is not so much transcribing the letters although that can be tricky but more often than not you end up with a skeletal construction because he does not put in vowels

8188497 for me a phase of weakening and a progressive convalescence is the most likely scenario
8188498 after the german economy began the year with a bang that was to be expected i nonetheless foresee more than a simple correction

8188504 the study confirmed that olive leaf extract efla 943 has antihypertensive properties in humans
8188505 this works showed that taking a 1000mg dose has substantial effects in people with borderline hypertension
8188506 recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of eukaryotic genes are mispredicted at the transcript level as the mispred routines are able to detect many of these errors and may aid in their correction we suggest that it may significantly improve the quality of protein sequence data based on gene predictions
8188507 some secreted proteins may truly lack secretory signal peptides since they are subject to leaderless protein secretion similarly it cannot be excluded at present that transchromosomal chimeras can be formed and may have normal physiological functions nevertheless the fact that mispred analyses of protein sequences of the swiss prot database identified very few such exceptions indicates that the rules of mispred are generally valid
8188508 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed
8188509 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8188510 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8188511 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8188512 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed
8188513 we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8188514 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations
8188515 the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems

8188525 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories
8188526 of the 2 519 batsmen who have taken the crease in 131 years of test cricket bradman stands alone and untouched

8188528 players with very little experience at the top level are criticising someone whose contribution to indian tennis is legendary leander had a talk with me he didnt want to go through that embarrassment once again and decided to step down
8188529 there was a time when the amritrajs and the krishnans did not see eye to eye as the then india coach i saw it from close quarters but they didnt make the spat public
8188530 see our resource is limited we didnt have a big pool to choose from still the aita had given the players an ultimatum but leander chose to quit in the interest of indian tennis
8188531 lots of people were interested for the post some very big names we have given him the job to avoid controversy romania would be a very tough proposition on clay whoever is the captain
8188532 in any case leander will play only in the doubles knowing him his intensity wont drop
8188533 i dont know exactly what happened between leander and the other players but in davis cup its always better to have a non playing captain it would be a sacrilege to deny his contribution but he and mahesh are not getting younger its time now to move on and shift focus to the youngsters prakash amritraj and somdev dev burman they are the future of indian tennis

8188674 there was anger there but our music was of a time and a place
8188675 there was so much mediocrity in music at the time nirvana had just come out but i honestly never thought about getting a record deal or the money we didnt care if we played to nine or 10 people all our spare money went to a rehearsal space and beer and the accoutrements

8188697 its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regime after some years of neglect
8188698 as you know in the recent budget we put considerably more inspectors and resources into this
8188699 obviously we want to make sure that the companies maintain their responsibilities and that we fully review all the facts here to understand what went wrong and how we can prevent it in the future
8188700 it is proven to be effective but people dont like using it
8188701 weve shown it gets transferred to the next 100 slices or more about 90 per cent of the transfer occurred in the first 10 slices
8188702 we dont swab for listeria any more the industry does all that themselves
8188703 they just document all this stuff we read their reports if their reports say they do everything fine then they do everything fine
8188704 its like in aviation we cant look under each jet engine of an airline but we can make sure the maintenance service works
8188705 all i can say is that with the new system that has been set up theres always an adjustment phase
8188706 we expect the companies to be responsible and not just go through the motions to placate the inspectors
8188707 by the time they finish doing the paperwork theyve got very little time to actually look at anything and it bothers them
8188708 the fact is listeria needs a very high dose how did such meat products get contaminated with such a high level of listeria in order to cause so much illness it needs over a billion cells to actually cause illness
8188709 its good composition its a strong story its literate and the audiences get it and really like it
8188710 bragging rights are nice but its nice for our audience to say theyre the first audience in canada to be able to see this work its not about the company doing it first
8188711 as soon as you get into that too much emotionally youre doomed because then youre not paying attention to whats right for your audience and your community ive seen colleagues over the years get all excited about what they were doing and how it was enhancing their international reputation and pretty soon they didnt have a job
8188712 lots of times were asked isnt this going to make your long term subscribers upset
8188713 not at all long term operagoers are the ones who want to see something new theyve seen nine boh me s they really welcome good newer work
8188714 when you only do three or four productions a year four in our case if you are not thoughtful about how and when you do this work you can really get a company in trouble
8188715 that kind of gave him a spark for the films
8188716 hes one of those filmmakers who wants to be a musician and i think that the way his films are trying to capture little fresh moments is a cool approach
8188717 its very important to me to not let the musician try to make the song perfect
8188718 its so much more human when a musician is doing this beautiful version of a song but messes up and then continues yeah thats beautiful to me
8188719 as far as the modern world is concerned these are natural environments
8188720 its filmed in its own elements from where it came from the streets and the bars and peoples apartments
8188721 lets put the final nail in the coffin on the term music video and allow it to be something of the past because thats exactly what it is
8188722 it served its purpose very well in the 1980s and 1990s music videos time came and went
8188723 i dont think music or film has been in a more exciting place in 20 years
8188724 i was just blown away by their beauty and how raw they were
8188725 we were just getting a little bit bored of watching the music promos
8188726 we didnt have much clout or really any money so the idea was to try to find a way to get our vision out there and get people to buy into it

8188765 my profile is created at a us based millionaire dating site i met quite a lot of interesting guys and it helped me decide what i did and didnt want from a relationship
8188766 i didnt meet anybody i thought was really weird they were fairly nice guys but i was careful to meet in a public place and tell people where i was going
8188767 i never put myself in any danger and the guys were normal to a certain degree they just didnt suit me
8188768 then i got this really nice email from a guy who looked normal there wasnt any weirdness and we liked talking about the same sort of things
8188769 if you are on the right place i think you can find somebody if youre careful and do it right but i do worry about young girls who get themselves into tricky situations and perhaps arent old enough or wise enough to get themselves out of it
8188770 i wasnt really into going to pubs and clubs and none of my friends had any for me i had a few workmates at the time who were having a go on the internet and i thought what have i got to lose
8188771 if i thought they sounded interesting i sent them a hi message and something most women dont seem to do i was keen to meet them quite quickly
8188772 i wasnt into the whole chatting online forever because my theory was worst case scenario we meet and dont hit it off i still have an ok sort of date get to meet someone new have a nice meal and nice conversation
8188773 i dont believe theres any way the virtual world can really represent who someone really is
8188774 no one turned up and went ew yuck how revolting
8188775 because im not a skinny person i would always make that really clear i didnt think there was any point in lying or misrepresenting myself
8188776 it was a nice photo but i thought it made him look really intellectual and really deep
8188777 we just talked the whole night we went to the lido restaurant for dinner and they started packing up around us so we had to leave then we went to midnight espresso cafe and spent ages there talking so we were out for quite a few hours
8188778 eventually he dropped me home and didnt give me a kiss goodnight but within a couple of days we met up again and had a picnic together which was really awesome
8188779 i felt like she was trying to rush me into the process of committing
8188780 his record being wrong on foreign policy is as long as his years in foreign policy
8188781 impenetrable thicket of words i dont know if anyone is ready to debate him
8188782 pales in comparison to the honor ive had representing you
8188783 we are delighted to be on travel and leisures best hotels worldwide it is indeed a great honour sun international strives to deliver an extraordinary experience at the table bay hotel

8188786 techshare 2008 will offer workshops and presentations on accessibility and draw upon the wisdom of people who have tremendous experience in the field

8188794 i shall not be bringing in anyone today wednesday or tomorrow so for now everyone should be concentrating on the job in hand and that is making sure that liverpool reach the group stages
8188795 my concern now is to improve how we play we can play better liege were good in the first leg but we were really poor
8188796 if we improve and play at our real level it will be very difficult for them
8188797 liege are probably the hardest opponents we have faced in champions league qualifiers but we know we are better than them even though they played well in the first leg
8188798 at anfield we are confident we can win and i expect us to win the key is to be calm and confident in your team and the ability of your players we have the players who can win this type of game
8188799 right now i am getting my visa as soon as it is ready i will fly to london to sign a contract

8188802 but now all doubts are behind me and i decided to sign a contract with tottenham and the formalities are practically settled

8188851 both sen john mccain and sen barack obama are poker players but neither one has expressed anything one way or the other regarding the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act
8188852 its pretty low on their radar for poker players i really dont think theres much difference between the candidates
8188853 were in favor of anything that gets poker back into the u s legally so that americans can play poker on their laptops and they can fund their accounts and they can do what they were able to do
8188854 theres only a handful of online poker rooms that still allow u s players the funding either in or out is very difficult for many players
8188855 nothing is going to happen in 08 because 08 is pretty much done
8188856 we wont see anything happen until january 09 at the earliest so basically were going to have to wait and see what the new congress is going to look like
8188857 one of the big issues with the uigea is that it needs clarification
8188858 it excludes horse racing fantasy sports and online lotteries sessions is saying that all online gambling is legal except for sports betting people that make sports bets take sports bets or facilitate sports bets would be criminals under his bill
8188859 republicans dont want gambling legalized democrats do and republicans will do or say whatever they need to do to make sure it stays illegal
8188860 its about the issues and the country and whos going to take it forward i thought they both presented a lot of opportunity for hope and moving forward obama is an extraordinary person and economically i couldnt reconcile where the republicans are taking us
8188861 i am here tonight as a proud mother as a proud democrat

8188866 now they cater to young people thats the way things are now with the music that no one can understand we have a great following when we were at the suncoast we had 500 every tuesday night but when boyd gaming took over they wanted a younger drinking crowd and my crowd is not a big drinking crowd thats the big knock on us they may not drink a lot but they eat and they gamble and when their children come to town they bring them to the property to show them where they hang out and show them theyre not just couch potatoes who stay home every night

8188877 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8188878 i am astounded at the hand wringing by clintonites even by my colleagues in congress with this angst we have to elect a president and the women who have supported hillary the most have been in the trenches for womens rights for a quarter of a century or more for them to put in harms way all the issues they have fought for and not support the democratic nominee is incomprehensible to me do we want another samuel alito on the bench another vote against roe v wade thats whats really at stake here

8188900 our bonus system i think our bonus system is causing some of the problems
8188901 well we wanted to make sure we didnt get into lawsuits based on construction defects so we pay a bonus to our engineering manager when we have zero claims it sounds noble but that sets up someone to over work against our operations manager who is just trying to get the job done
8188902 to make matters worse we diligently work the project schedules to avoid delay claims delay claims can do more than suck the profit out of a job so we pay a bonus to our operations manager when we have zero delay claims
8188903 so now i have two people on the same team who are working against each other
8188904 the worst part about our bonus system is that it creates mistrust
8188905 it depends on the bishop of a certain region and fortunately for me communion has not been withheld and im a regular communicant so that would be a severe blow to me if that were the case
8188906 the speaker is the mother of five children and seven grandchildren and fully appreciates the sanctity of family she was raised in a devout catholic family who often disagreed with her pro choice views
8188907 after she was elected to congress and the choice issue became more public as she would have to vote on it she studied the matter more closely
8188908 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view
8188909 the speaker has a long proud record of working with the catholic church on many issues including alleviating poverty and promoting social justice and peace

8188917 i was pleased he finished not out with six catches its brilliant because it has been a headache for however long with our wicketkeeper but lets hope it stays good because hes a hell of a batsman
8188918 he was brilliant but the thing im trying to tell matty and drum into him and the young players is thats great to be on top of a wave but youve got to try to get to that level where youre cool youre calm and youre responsible and you deliver day in and day out

8188930 after the vehicle pulled up on her the passenger exited
8188931 the female approached the victim pulled a gun on her and demanded her keys the children were in their car seats and the victim was accosted as she was getting them out of the car
8188932 the victim received very minor injuries that required no treatment after the scuffle the suspect got back into the car and they fled the area
8188933 there is absolutely no doubt from the victim report eyewitness reports and video that this was a random crime
8188934 most of our crime in shopping areas and in our city in general is property crime and were super concerned when something like this happens
8188935 we are working with the st charles police department right now to confirm and review what they have in their case there is a very strong possibility that the vehicle used in this crime was stolen from st charles
8188936 the police have completely ignored what i told them thats not what she was wearing at all
8188937 she was wearing a boucle coat and a fur hat an outfit i had often admired
8188938 but she wasnt wearing a red leather coat so i must have seen her the day before

8188950 immediately asked relevant government departments to investigate those that started the rumour
8188951 this paper studies the influence of mass media on u s government response to approximately 5 000 natural disasters occurring between 1968 and 2002 these disasters took nearly 63 000 lives and affected 125 million people per year we show that u s relief depends on whether the disaster occurs at the same time as other newsworthy events such as the olympic games which are obviously unrelated to need we argue that the only plausible explanation of this is that relief decisions are driven by news coverage of disasters and that the other newsworthy material crowds out this news coverage

8188980 but i believe in quantum physics and in karma that what goes around comes around

8189035 should go a long way to reassuring joe average if not joe wingnut that michelle obama has figured out how to be a first lady for her time

8189053 and if all contracts are solid were willing to negotiate with management at an appropriate time in the future to make sure our interests are being satisfied
8189054 for the past five years there has been a noticable trade imbalance between the usa and other nations working within the e gaming photographic images market particularly in operations and human capital the recent advances however will help mend this rift and keep more dollars on shore i expect to see demand for labor increase in the long run with additional long run profits for strong e gaming photographic images usa companies that move forward
8189055 im getting calls from e gaming photographic images industry executives investors and general employees all asking about what is going on and if they can provide information for the news agency of course they want their names mentioned so that a little publicity is given to their particular e gaming photographic images company but it does save me from hunting these people down and taking interviews

8189057 output of e gaming photographic images related products will nearly double overhead will decrease by 1 3 and employee salaries will increase by 15

8189073 set of networked services that allows people to discover access use and publish resources within the dner
8189074 navigate a complex set of different websites with different search interfaces
8189075 lack of mediation to provide vital signposts to explain context and relevance to the user
8189076 users do not all want to access information in the same way but will require a diverse range of views of resources in order to satisfy their needs

8189093 construction of these goals is likely to be time consuming and complex but that the collaborative creation of goals is crucial to a successful virtual team working towards these goals will ultimately result in a level of trust

8189130 theres no vulnerabilities no protocol errors there are no software problems the problem arises from the level of interconnectivity thats needed to maintain this mess to keep it all working
8189131 everyone has assumed until now that you have to break something for a hijack to be useful
8189132 but what we showed here is that you dont have to break anything and if nothing breaks who notices
8189133 the rate of bgp path updates goes up by a factor of 200 to 400
8189134 they simply dont because it takes work and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive
8189135 that means that nobody could put themselves into the chain into the path unless they had been authorized to do so by the preceding as router in the path
8189136 we havent seen the attacks and so a lot of times people dont start working on things and trying to fix them until they get attacked
8189137 but the youtube case is the perfect example of an attack where somebody could have done much worse than what they did
8189138 the only thing that can force them to fix bgp is if their customers start to demand security solutions
8189139 pilosovs innovation is to forward the intercepted data silently to the actual destination so that no outage occurs
8189140 why does your belief that he went to a muslim school have more influence over your vote than the issues

8189145 i will not vote for mccain but he obama has a lot to prove to me in two months or i wont be voting
8189146 anyone with a bgp router isps large corporations or anyone with space at a carrier hotel could intercept data headed to a target ip address or group of addresses the attack intercepts only traffic headed to target addresses not from them and it cant always vacuum in traffic within a network say from one at amp t customer to another
8189147 kapela said eavesdropping could be thwarted if isps aggressively filtered to allow only authorized peers to draw traffic from their routers and only for specific ip prefixes but filtering is labor intensive
8189148 i saw some guys tent thrown on the fire then his bags then he got beaten up
8189149 when the security guy tried to stop the fire his extinguisher was taken off him and he got taken out
8189150 this was going on opposite our tents in the indigo camp we ended up having to pack up our stuff at 3am because of the w s ruining it for everyone
8189151 packed up before tenacious d and then left after metallica i wanted to keep my tent and contents for next year
8189152 i know sunday night involves some people acting stupidly setting fires and blowing up the canisters which i detest and hate
8189153 some idiots started a fire behind our camp which then attracted many more rioters around the fire chanting and then the chant became gazebo
8189154 they proceeded to attack another tent pull it apart and put it on to the fire at this point one individual then pulled out the content of a girls tent out broke her guitar and started to throw it on the fire and then started to remove more contents
8189155 the girl along with my daughter then tried to stop him removing the contents as it was just behind our camp and could see it escalating more and taking in our tents
8189156 this is the very most serious bit the guy was very abusive toward the girls he told her to get out of the tent or he would burn her with the tent which she refused to do
8189157 he then started to pull the tent with my daughter inside toward the fire
8189158 luckily another guy held on to the other corner of the tent and stopped the burning of the tent and human contents as she was unable to scramble out
8189159 he was heading for a charge of assault gbh manslaughter or worst case murder

8189205 cada dos o tres a os cuando hay cambios de temperatura en el ambiente con mucha humedad por causa de las lluvias este virus enferma a nuestra poblaci n infantil en todos los pa ses de am rica y provoca muchas muertes podemos con toda seguridad reafirmar las medidas de atenci n y prevenci n que ya hab amos recomendado anteriormente

8189207 si me quieren echar preso y en este sistema que hay ahora en nicaragua todo es posible estoy listo para ir a la c rcel
8189208 se trata de un fallo objetivo yo apel el fallo del juez de menor instancia subi al de distrito quien decidi que s hab a m rito para condenar al se or cardenal por el delito de injurias por qu hasta ahora hombr no te lo puedo explicar pero creo que tiene que ver con el proceso de limpieza de casos viejos que se est dando en los juzgados
8189209 es simplemente una venganza de daniel ortega por la acogida que tuve en paraguay durante la toma de posesi n del presidente lugo mientras a l se le impidi llegar afirm el sacerdote trapense
8189210 juez danielista que en tiempos de la revoluci n fue miembro de la seguridad del estado y es el mismo que posteriormente absolvi a byron jerez y el abogado que ha respaldado al alem n zerger es precisamente el mismo abogado de daniel ortega jos ram n rojas m ndez
8189211 de todo tipo de mentiras insultos y calumnias con la intenci n de apropiarse de un hotel propiedad de la asociaci n para el desarrollo de solentiname
8189212 de este sistema judicial no pod s esperar otras cosas sobre todo cuando responde a intereses pol ticos de daniel ortega
8189213 se trata de una manifiesta manipulaci n de los tribunales lo cual debe ser causa de aflicci n para el pa s porque se trata de una acci n temeraria en contra de una figura que tiene una relevancia mundial y no tiene otro calificativo m s que de una barbarie
8189214 y podr amos ver un alud de nieve gigantesco en contra de los autores de la barbarie
8189215 porque ante estas situaciones debemos ser solidarios sobre todo con figuras como ernesto que han puesto muy en alto el nombre de nicaragua
8189216 imaginate que se trata de un caso por el que el mismo sistema judicial ya lo hab a absuelto y que lo traen a colaci n ahora que el poeta ha sido homenajeado en paraguay es decir todo apunta a una decisi n de orden pol tico
8189217 esto no es m s que una demostraci n de debilidad del gobierno esto se llama miedo porque saben el peso que tiene la voz de ernesto cardenal y por eso vamos a denunciar este atropello a nivel internacional porque somos solidarios con l y lo advertimos no est solo y un ataque contra ernesto es un ataque contra todos nosotros las y los escritores del pa s
8189218 no es m s que una muestra de la cobard a con que act an los que ostentan el poder en contra de quienes se muestran cr ticos y adversos
8189219 esto es horrible lo que est pasando y te digo que es tanto as que no encuentro palabras para describirte lo que siento
8189220 estoy impactada de ver la arbitrariedad y el abuso que se est cometiendo en contra de personalidades que lo nico que han hecho es poner en lo m s alto el nombre de nicaragua y que dedic su vida a la revoluci n estoy espantada porque estamos volviendo a lo m s puro del somocismo
8189221 una venganza pol tica de daniel ortega y rosario murillo y es para obligar a callar a todo el mundo
8189222 lo que no pudo hacer el somocismo no lo podr n hacer rosario murillo y daniel ortega ste es un gobierno vengativo venga traidos pol ticos y pretende callar a todo el mundo ste no es hecho aislado es s lo una represi n m s
8189223 es una jugada m s del r gimen que est utilizando a su juguete favorito que es el poder judicial para premiar a amigos y castigar a adversarios esta vez ni siquiera tuvieron el tacto de dejar pasar un tiempo sino que lo hacen inmediatamente despu s de lo ocurrido en paraguay es decir no se guardan las apariencias y embisten de manera directa
8189224 quieren responsabilizar al padre de la falta de acogida del presidente en paraguay parece que hay una envidia por el nivel de reconocimiento que tiene el poeta y que lo va a seguir teniendo esto evidencia que seguimos en camino hacia el autoritarismo en el r gimen m s intolerante que ha habido desde somoza porque la consigna es est s conmigo o contra m

8189340 this partnership represents major step forward in our strategy of expanding nexants cutting edge it based solutions for the energy sector

8189342 promia is proud to be working with nexant to protect our critical national networks in the energy area
8189343 nexants reputation for excellence in the energy industry and its preeminence as a provider of it solutions for is further complimented by its deep technology expertise and asset management offerings we believe that our partnership provides a cips compliance offering that is unique in the power sector and immediately positions us an industry leader
8189344 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8189345 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8189346 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8189347 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8189348 arrests and violations of the nfl conduct code have become an unfortunate trend amongst the leagues players
8189349 and its an excellent way for us to make some money
8189350 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8189351 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8189352 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8189353 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8189354 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8189355 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8189356 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8189357 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8189358 who are open to doing something on the production side
8189359 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8189360 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8189361 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8189362 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8189363 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8189364 in 2500 b c egyptians knew swimming as an organized activity depictions of swimming from india are equally old ancient romans constructed artificial pools for athletic training nautical games and military exercises
8189365 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8189366 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8189367 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8189368 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8189369 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8189370 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8189371 it is the soldier not the community organizer who has given us the to demonstrate

8189375 hey did you ever think about this absurd mentality that has found its way into our culture
8189376 why yes but what allows individuals the perception of uniqueness is diversity and proximity those ideas and experiences that would be defined as unique are paralleled by the ideas and experiences of others but occur beyond the perception of the former individual this creates a unique experience even if it be to some degree an illusion

8189381 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8189382 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8189383 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8189384 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8189385 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8189386 the sex files blog is looking at the difficulties people who are sex and gender diverse experience in being identified as their true sex or affirmed gender in official documents and government records
8189387 the issue of legal recognition and the ability to amend documentation was most frequently raised in our consultations
8189388 people asked the commission to focus on legislative reform and ensure we consult widely with sex and gender diverse communities in the process
8189389 the sex files blog aims to reach as many people in the sex and gender diverse communities as possible
8189390 i wonder how it works does it increase only the cooldown on abilities with a cooldown or does it affect even abilities without any cooldown giving them a cooldown now
8189391 stack with that adding 50 crit damage 100 damage now
8189392 i guess its a defensive tactic to get rid of other melees slapping the squishies or knocking people off cliffs etc does a knockback interrupt casting abilities
8189393 jeder bekommt das was er verdient und was seine arbeit wert ist
8189394 our need and not just in relation to public health issues is to act on the environment while fostering positive peer pressure and social norms we have to take away the excuses
8189395 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8189396 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8189397 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8189398 i dont know how you can look at your kids and do this when the next police officer is gunned down or killed is it fair to blame you because i am going to give you partial blame
8189399 to do the kind of attack that this bruce jacobs did on the widow of a murdered officer that gave his life for this community less than year ago is reprehensible
8189400 bruce jacobs you coldheartedly attacked a heros wife and family and attempted to disgrace his memory
8189401 i was asked to speak on the human costs of illegal immigration and i think im qualified to speak on that

8189588 son dos goles uno siempre quiere m s pero lo importante era ganar ahora vamos con m s tranquilidad y sabiendo que vamos a tener enfrente un equipo que va a proponer mucho m s
8189589 nunca se desesper mantuvo el orden y trat de jugar bien el bal n por abajo pero ten amos enfrente un rival duro que se defiende bien y le da trato a la pelota as que seguramente va a ser dur simo en su casa
8189590 son muy pocas las oportunidades que te da la vida y creo que se deben aprovechar al m ximo creo que ahora lo aprovech y hay que seguir trabajando nosotros no tenemos mucha participaci n en el torneo regular entonces hay que aprovechar esta participaci n en la concacaf o en torneos como el teresa herrera
8189591 en lo personal llevo cinco goles all primera a estoy entre los goleadores del torneo y vamos empujando fuerte
8189592 sabemos que no eran muy dotados t cnicamente pero nosotros hicimos lo nuestro
8189593 al se or le hizo mucho da o la condici n de este partido
8189594 el partido ven a desarroll ndose con normalidad con incidencias que son propias de un partido internacional y una copa como sta la situaci n comenz a desfigurarse con la aparici n del se or juez que a mi concepto fue el que desequilibr el partido
8189595 con esto no quiero quitarle m rito a la victoria de san luis con esos dos goles que convirtieron en donde hay que destacar a los jugadores de san luis pero lamentablemente el se or rbitro tuvo mucho que ver en esa jugada en donde pudo haber sacado amarilla y eso evidenci lo que vimos todos a lo largo de los 90 minutos pues en faltas similares tuvo criterios diferentes
8189596 yo lo invito a que mire el video en donde comete dos errores monumentales t cnicos el se or se invent un penal que nunca existi al se or le hizo mucho da o la condici n de este partido
8189597 este nivel es mucho m s alto que el nuestro
8189598 en el terreno tambi n nos falt compa erismo cuando llegamos el t cnico nos lo pidi y nos falt en la cancha creo que tambi n nos desesperamos nosotros vinimos a este partido a querer ganar y antes de jugar el duelo nos falt un poco de actitud y de la experiencia que tiene cruz azul que juega con muchos equipos nosotros casi no tenemos partidos internacionales o amistosos siempre jugamos en casa entre nosotros mismos y este nivel es mucho m s alto que el nuestro
8189599 la altura nos afect un poco esperemos que de regreso a casa podamos sacar un partido mejor del que jugamos hoy ah esperemos que se d un partido diferente ya que no nos afecta la altura adem s tendremos el apoyo de la afici n
8189600 lo que m s me gust fue el esfuerzo y la seriedad con que se jug este partido m s all del rival que hizo un gran esfuerzo el equipo se comport a la altura y lo tom debe de ser como lo es esta instituci n una instituci n seria
8189601 son partidos que ellos lo jugaron como debe de ser estaban muy motivados y la responsabilidad de ellos era dejar una buena imagen y no fue f cil el equipo se esforz al m ximo y para m fue justo siempre vas a querer m s pero los que mandan son ellos en la cancha oportunidades hubo generaron muchas llegadas lo importante es que se hicieron seis goles que me dejan satisfecho
8189602 no es una novedad lo est haciendo bastante bien en la primera a y es un jugador que se le ve que tiene hambre que tiene ganas deseos de sobresalir
8189603 no est escrito nada all va a ser un partido complicado a ellos les gusta el roce la situaci n es que ellos piensan que con eso van a ganar el juego l gicamente all no esperamos menos
8189604 la realidad es que es un trabajo en equipo trato de hacer las cosas lo mejor posible y lo bueno es que ayudo al equipo
8189605 tenemos por ah un gol de ventaja la realidad es que falta jugar un partido all pero tenemos la capacidad de convertir un gol y complicarles un poco m s el pase
8189606 la altura no tiene que ser ning n impedimento vamos a ver c mo est la cancha l gicamente ellos van a ser los que propongan nosotros tenemos que jugar de otra manera y a ver qu tal nos va
8189607 siempre tratamos de jugar limpio ellos tambi n hicieron un buen trabajo fue un partido lindo la afici n de cruz azul qued contenta con tantos goles y ojal que en nuestra cancha no se repita lo mismo hay que mejorar en la marca y especialmente en el mediocampo
8189608 el partido no sali como hubi ramos querido cruz azul es un gran equipo dominaron en la media cancha y se adue aron del partido en ese sector fue donde nos ganaron el partido y nos superaron jugaron mejor que nosotros tienen buenos toques y son muy r pidos
8189609 ya sabemos c mo juega un equipo profesional en belice los equipos no son profesionales ya que todos nosotros trabajamos nuestra profesi n no es sta hay algunos que son maestros o que trabajan con el deporte de salud y s lo de noche jugamos por amor y no por dinero alg n d a llegaremos a este nivel
8189610 haciendo un buen partido la expulsi n nos afect pero no nos desmotivamos al contrario buscamos el arco contrario logramos empatar pero despu s se nos hizo imposible
8189611 sabemos que con un 2 0 podemos pasar por ah debemos de mejorar tratar de no recibir m s goles en el partido de vuelta
8189612 es importante en esta clase de torneos pero nos quedamos con un sinsabor de no poder llevarnos un triunfo y que por ah checando los videos me parece que el arbitraje fue malo
8189613 diego cervantes es un jugador que simula mucho se lo dije al rbitro de nada sirvi nos vamos un poco dolidos por esa expulsi n y por que el equipo se entreg y no merec amos perder tres uno
8189614 todav a es posible una calificaci n el poder hacer dos goles all habr que cuidarse mucho en la parte defensiva pues el fuerte de san luis son sus jugadores de ataque as que vamos con esa ilusi n de sacar el partido adelante
8189615 un gol que conquistemos de visita nos facilitar las cosas
8189616 todav a no hemos ganado nada queda otro partido hay que trabajar y seguir as entrenar m s duro
8189617 no quiere decir nada ellos juegan de local van a salir m s concentrados y bueno un gol que conquistemos de visita nos facilitar las cosas

8189620 drie gewapende overvallers gepakt en er is geen schot gelost
8189621 ze zijn onlosmakelijk met elkaar verbonden als je globaal denkt of het nu economisch ecologisch sociaal of cultureel is dan kom je onvermijdelijk bij de vraag of we niet beter lokaal kunnen eten als je het ecologisch bekijkt we hebben maar n planeet aarde en door al het overbodige transport van grote hoeveelheden voedsel waaronder veel dierenvoeding zetten we die planeet zwaar onder druk uitputting van grondstoffen het klimaatprobleem met onze nieuwe affiche de appel valt ver van de boom willen we de consument daarvan bewust maken wat komt er op ons bord hoeveel kilometer heeft ons voedsel afgelegd
8189622 het gaat vooral om het in overweging nemen van de kilometers die ons voedsel aflegt weten wat je eet en wat daarvan de gevolgen zijn je hoeft je bijvoorbeeld niet schuldig te voelen als je een kopje koffie drinkt de hoeveelheid koffie die je daarvoor nodig hebt is minien en we moeten realistisch zijn sommige producten k nnen we gewoon niet zelf telen die moeten van de andere kant van de wereld komen voor die producten kan je als bewuste consument het fair trade principe als leidraad nemen zo kan je in plaats van verse ananassen te kopen in de winkel ge mporteerd uit een ver land ook gedroogde ananas kopen in de wereldwinkel dat weegt minder en ze zijn geproduceerd op een sociaal rechtvaardige manier ook daar gaat het ons om wervel betekent werkgroep voor een rechtvaardige en verantwoorde landbouw sociaal rechtvaardig en ecologisch verantwoord dat is allebei belangrijk
8189623 een gekend voorbeeld zijn de tomaten uit almeria in zuid spanje tomaten kunnen we in belgi niet het hele jaar door koud kweken we hebben verwarmde serres nodig sommige milieumensen zeggen dat is bezwarend voor ons milieu dus we kunnen ze beter gewoon importeren uit een warm land alleen weet je dan niet altijd in welke sociaal onrechtvaardige omstandigheden ze zijn geproduceerd over de mistoestanden in almeria is al veel geschreven te lage lonen ongezonde werkomstandigheden
8189624 wij van wervel zeggen iedereen is vrij om te eten wat hij wil maar als we verder gaan op de ingeslagen weg zal ons vleesgebruik tot catastrofale gevolgen leiden zeker nu er steeds meer nieuwe vleeseters bij komen al die dieren moeten eerst zelf gevoed worden dat gebeurt momenteel vooral met soja die uit argentini praguay bolivi de vs en vooral brazili komt die soja kan niet onuitputtelijk verder worden aangeplant het amazone gebied is nu al voor een groot deel verwoest met wervel proberen we daarom aan lokale alternatieven te werken die ge mporteerde soja vervangen door plaatselijk veevoeder maar dan nog ook onze gronden zijn beperkt als je alles op een rijtje zet moeten we sowieso onze vleesconsumptie minderen vlees is ook geen noodzakelijke component in onze voeding
8189625 we hebben een heel mooie eetcultuur met overgeleverde gebruiken allerlei gewassen dat spelen we stilaan kwijt met alle gevolgen van dien er zijn tegenwoordig heel veel mensen met voedselproblemen zoals glutenintolerantie twee jaar geleden op reis in frankrijk vertelde een oude boer die nog oude graansoorten produceert ons dat die helemaal niet zoveel gluten bevatten en veel gezonder zijn dat zet je toch aan het denken onze eetgewoonten zijn verstoord natuurlijk mag je gerust oosters eten maar ga terwijl je je gerecht bereidt eens na welke ingredi nten je kan vervangen door iets lokaals dat zal je niet alleen een beter gevoel geven maar het zal ook economisch minder doorwegen in je portemonee want al die import en export van voedsel kost ook enorm veel geld het is maar door massale hoeveelheden te transporteren dat men de prijs kan drukken maar waar zijn we dan eigenlijk mee bezig momenteel kan ons land nog maar vijf weken per jaar in zn eigen voedsel voorzien het ziet er naar uit dat dat nog verder zal verminderen de lokale boer die hier zijn paprika of zijn groenten produceert vindt geen afzet meer
8189626 dat geloof ik niet als je bepaalde criteria in de gaten houdt korte keten seizoensgebonden lokaal geproduceerd dan moet je automatisch aan een lagere prijs geraken alleen in een supermarkt zal je de vrac wortelen uit je eigen streek meestal niet zo makkelijk vinden als andere duurdere soorten ze staan meestal ergens onderaan het rek en vaak vergeten men er zelfs het prijskaartje bij te zetten die wortelen zijn commercieel immers niet zo interessant
8189627 je moet goed beseffen hoeveel invloed je als consument hebt op de directeur van je supermarkt eigenlijk zouden we naar hem toe moeten stappen en zeggen als er in de winter aarbeien liggen ik moet die aardbeien die van de andere kant van de wereld komen niet en wat liggen die boontjes uit kenia hier nu zijn er toch boontjes van bij ons wees maar assertief die mensen staan daar voor open maar je kan ook op zoek gaan naar een verkooppunt dat producten van lokale producenten rechtstreeks bij de consument brengt zoals een voedselteam dan laat je je leiden baken je je keuzes af maar dat is niet altijd gemakkelijk want we leven in een land met tweeverdieners en we hebben weinig tijd een andere optie is zoveel mogelijk plaatselijk kopen als je in je buurt iemand hebt die voedsel produceert ga het dan daar halen dat brengt ons bij het sociale aspect geef toe als je prei gaat kopen bij je lokale boer en je hebt de week daarvoor nog door zijn veld gereden en gemerkt dat het naar pesticides stonk dan ga je toch iets van zeggen de voedselketen zo kort mogelijk maken zorgt voor een spontane ecologische controle het voedsel wordt vanzelf verser onbesproeid onbestraald ongemodificeerd gezonder streekeigener en smakelijker
8189628 ja natuurlijk je hebt het verhaal van de economische globalisering door de handel in landbouwproducten vrij te maken kunnen de ontwikkelingslanden hun landbouw niet meer beschermen terwijl de ontwikkelde landen dat vroeger w l hebben gedaan en nog steeds blijven doen dat heeft allemaal te maken met de afspraken die worden gemaakt in de wereld handelsorganisatie wto in onze volgende wervelkrant zal een artikel staan over de actuele ontwikkelingen ter zake dan spreken we inderdaad over beleid en beleidsveranderingen daar zijn we sterk mee bezig
8189629 ook in eigen land we zijn momenteel in gesprek met bemefa de belgische beroepsvereniging van mengvoederfabrikanten rond de herkomst van de eiwitten die gebruikt worden in de dierenvoeding rond de soja en maisproblematiek dus we pleiten voor het implementeren van alternatieven we proberen de boeren te overhalen tot het telen van lokale eiwitten hennep bijvoorbeeld de hennepplant is zeer eiwitrijk maar ze heeft een kwalijke reputatie omwille van het canabisgebruik wij hebben het echter over industri le hennep die daar niets mee te maken heeft toch staat de plant omwille van die kwalijke reputatie nog steeds op de lijst van verboden producten dat beleid aanpassen zou een zeer belangrijke stap zijn dat geldt ook voor andere alternatieven voor soja bijvoorbeeld lupines of amarant ook daar moet het beleid veranderen alvorens boeren zullen overstappen op die teelten nu staat vlaanderen vol met mais omdat dat gecombineerd met soja uit brazili het ideale dierenvoeder oplevert de boeren krijgen daar subsidies voor het zou goed zijn als er een aanmoediging kwam vanuit het beleid voor het telen van de meer verantwoorde alternatieven
8189630 we gaan dit schooljaar samenwerken met globelink het vroegere jongerenparlement zij zullen onze campagne mee helpen uitdragen in de scholen en actief met het thema aan de slag gaan we gaan ook samenwerken met mensen uit de vrouwenbewegingen die graag kookavonden organiseren via kookfiches bieden we zeer concrete tips voor mensen die dit gedachtengoed willen toepassen in een bepaald gerecht
8189631 we gaan ook zeker meewerken aan de derde editie van de week van de smaak de gevoeligheid die er dan bij de vlamingen leeft willen we aangrijpen niet alleen om het over smaak te hebben maar ook om dat grote landbouwdebat op het dagelijkse bord te krijgen we gaan daarvoor op zoek naar niet voor de hand liggende partners sociale restaurants zoals de vlaspit in sherpenheuvel of het fietsherstelbedrijf velo in leuven daar is trouwens een leuke anecdote aan verbonden met de multiculturele groep van velo hebben we vorig jaar al tijdends de week van de smaak soep gemaakt en daar is een staartje aan gekomen sindsdien maken ze elke week samen verse soep dit jaar hebben we gezegd na de soep de patatten want het is het internationaaal jaar van de belgische aardappel we zullen ook samenwerken met enkele jeugdherbergen rond bewustmaking als mensen op reis gaan wat komt er dan in hun rugzak terecht op uitnodiging van eva gaan we tijdens de week van de smaak ook meewerken aan de gastentafel in leuven
8189632 dat is gegroeid uit een zoektocht naar duurzaam campagnemateriaal papier gooit iedereen weg en er is al zo veel we hebben daarom porseleinen borden en kommen met daarop de slogan denk globaal eet lokaal laten maken er zijn ondertussen al meer dan 1000 borden en 600 soepkommen in omloop op verschillende plaatsen waar veel mensen komen in opleidingscentra vormingsinstellingen restaurants maar ook bij particulieren als je gasten over de vloer krijgt en je eet op zulke borden dan kan het voedselthema misschien spontaan ter sprake komen wij brengen onze boodschap via ons servies bij de mensen
8189633 graag de aardappel is echt een interessante plant hij wordt geteeld op koude grond hij scoort heel laag qua co2 uitstoot we willen van de aardappel tijdens de week van de smaak de drager maken van onze campagne denk globaal eet lokaal er is een oneindig aanbod aan aardappelrecepten frieten zijn natuurlijk het meest bekend maar er is zoveel meer een warme uitgeholde aardappel waarin je geitenkaas doet of je kan werken met nootjes of rozijnen of je kan aardappelen koken in de pel en die dan in blokjes snijden en overgieten met olijfolie en eventueel serveren met een stukje spek watertandend maar dan wel liefst spek van sojavrij vlees

8189757 mr mcgartland was consulted by the filmmakers during the production read the script and watched the film in advance of any public screening he was also given the opportunity to have the name of the lead character replaced with a fictional character name which he declined
8189758 the film although inspired by the contents is not a representation of mr mcgartlands life
8189759 i am deeply saddened by this pathetic inability to accept that art is inextricably linked to change unfortunately one of italys problems is that power is always in the hands of old people who ignore everything that has been accomplished by younger talent i find this gross lack of generosity simply pitiful
8189760 artists should support their fellow artists because if they attack them then in a way they attack themselves i hope that if im lucky enough to live and work as long as my distinguished colleagues zeffirelli and maazel i will not look back in anger but will have the generosity of spirit to try to understand and offer help

8189763 they were done in secret with no consultation with no public review

8189772 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8189773 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer
8189774 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats okay
8189775 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8189776 i knew id dug as deep as i could dig and worked as hard as i could work

8189780 that was the hard part knowing when to throw in the towel and go about making adjustments
8189781 when youve been doing something for 15 years when youve been working your whole career on trying to do something a certain way well its hard to scrap

8189790 i just told them were putting together a punk rock festival here in bremerton
8189791 when everyone heard about it they got really excited to get involved it was pretty easy as far as getting the bands lined up
8189792 a lot of the bands on the bill have either played for me in the past at other events or are tight with other bands up here in our scene
8189793 hendrix and mcjohns havent done many concerts in this area but theyve done quite a bit in seattle they kind of wanted to get over in the kitsap peninsula combining it with this fundraiser seemed like a great idea

8189807 we intend to present evidence that proves the mayor did not misuse public funds for personal gain and that there was no failure to appropriately inform city council about the facts of the court ordered settlement
8189808 then they seem to have come together to work together
8189809 the relationship was professional they both wanted to be able to obtain certain things for the success of both the city and the state

8189832 i cant say if ive been included in the andriy shevchenko deal because if someone has promised me to abramovich it wasnt me
8189833 ive always said im happy at milan and as long as my aims remain the same as milans ill stay here until now its always been that way
8189834 my goal is to win milans is too as long as we are like that ill remain at milan

8189836 i told them no i dont want to go i love it here i want to stay

8189841 i know theres been some conjecture about whether hes going to be captaining ireland but i would imagine hes going to be captain of ireland
8189842 for him it will mean not having as much responsibility all the time and i dont see the point in him having all the responsibility here and then all the responsibility with ireland as well
8189843 i think for him its an opportunity to concentrate on his game number one without worrying about the whole team too and also i think hes going to be the national captain as well
8189844 he himself and i agree with him think its an opportunity for him to focus on the quality he can produce in both of those arenas i dont want to ask him to do too much
8189845 he captained leinster a few times when brian was injured last year
8189846 hes got a lot of respect among the players hes got good delegation skills as well and hes obviously got aspirations higher up the chain himself so its a matter of managing him
8189847 i would love to be on the team no matter what but to be on it with a win under my belt would be fantastic
8189848 im ready to win and hopefully it will be this week

8189852 drug use and drug users are bad and the way to deal with it is to crack down on it and lets have mandatory minimum sentences for drug offences
8189853 its a very ostrich like approach i think sticking ones head in the sand and ignoring the reality and just maintaining a very black and white notion of how to deal with a public health problem thats actually quite complex
8189854 you need to have a range of interventions and it really needs to be driven by what the best available evidence is what the public health problem is and what solutions might address it

8189880 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8189881 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8189882 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8189883 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8189884 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8189885 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8189886 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8189887 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8189888 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8189889 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8189890 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8189891 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8189892 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8189893 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

8189910 et ici je ne puis memp cher de faire remarquer combien est puissant le sentiment que jinvoque dans tout le cours de cet article et dont les modernes r formateurs ne semblent pas soup onner lexistence je veux parler de laversion pour lincertitude
8189911 il ny a rien de bien surprenant ce que tous les propri taires se r unissent et r partissent autant que possible les mauvaises chances en fondant une assurance mutuelle contre lincendie
8189912 leur convention est tr s simple en voici la formule si la maison de lun de nous br le les autres se cotiseront pour venir en aide lincendi
8189913 par l chaque propri taire acquiert une double certitude cest moi qui souligne dabord quil prendra une petite part tous les sinistres de cette esp ce ensuite quil naura jamais essuyer le malheur tout entier au fond et si lon calcule sur un grand nombre dann es on voit que le propri taire fait pour ainsi dire un arrangement avec lui m me il conomise de quoi r parer les sinistres qui le frappent voil lassociation cest m me des arrangements de cette nature que les socialistes donnent exclusivement le nom dassociation
8189914 leur but le but des propri taires nest pas cependant compl tement atteint et il est encore beaucoup dal atoire dans leur position
8189915 lassurance mutuelle a d velopp au sein de la soci t une connaissance exp rimentale savoir la proportion en moyenne annuelle entre les valeurs perdues par sinistres et les valeurs assur es
8189916 or cette mutuelle assurance contre les chances de lavenir est tout fait subordonn e un genre de science humaine que jappellerai statistique exp rimentale et cette statistique faisant des progr s ind finis puisquelle est fond e sur lexp rience il sensuit que la fixit fait aussi des progr s ind finis
8189917 sur quoi un entrepreneur ou une soci t ayant fait tous ses calculs se pr sente aux propri taires et leur dit en vous assurant mutuellement vous avez voulu acheter votre tranquillit et la quote part ind termin e que vous r servez annuellement pour couvrir les sinistres est le prix que co te un bien si pr cieux mais ce prix ne vous est jamais connu davance dun autre c t votre tranquillit nest point parfaite eh bien je viens vous proposer un autre proc d moyennant une prime annuelle fixe que vous payerez jassume toutes vos chances de sinistres je vous assure tous et voici le capital qui vous garantit lex cution de mes engagements
8189918 les compagnies sassurent entre elles par les r assurances de telle sorte quau point de vue de la r paration des sinistres qui est le fond du ph nom ne mille associations diverses tablies en angleterre en france en allemagne en am rique se fondent en une grande et unique association
8189919 dans les temps dinexp rience et de barbarie sans doute les hommes socient sassocient puisque nous lavons d montr ils ne peuvent pas vivre sans cela mais lassociation ne peut prendre chez eux que cette forme primitive l mentaire que les socialistes nous donnent comme la loi et le salut de lavenir
8189920 plus tard quand deux hommes ont longtemps travaill ensemble chances communes il arrive un moment o le risque pouvant tre appr ci lun deux lassume tout entier sur lui m me moyennant une r tribution convenue
8189921 pour que certains hommes consentent assumer sur eux m mes forfait des risques qui incombent naturellement dautres il faut quun certain genre de connaissance que jai appel statistique exp rimentale ait fait quelque progr s car il faut bien que lexp rience mette m me dappr cier au moins approximativement ces risques et par cons quent la valeur du service quon rend celui quon en affranchit
8189922 le trait forfait suppose au moins un commencement de statistique exp rimentale
8189923 le salariat fut un progr s dabord le travail ant rieur et le travail actuel sassoci rent risques communs pour des entreprises communes dont le cercle sous une telle formule dut tre bien restreint ibid p 411
8189924 le salariat est ce degr interm diaire qui s pare lal atoire de la stabilit
8189925 sur cette r ponse les termes du contrat seront chang s on continuera bien dunir ses efforts den partager les produits et par cons quent lassociation ne sera pas dissoute mais elle sera modifi e en ce sens que lune des parties le capital prendra la charge de tous les risques et la compensation de tous les profits extraordinaires tandis que lautre partie le travail sassurera les avantages de la fixit telle est lorigine du salaire
8189926 plus tard les deux associ s sans rompre lassociation trait rent forfait du risque commun
8189927 les services s changent contre des services ce qui d termine l change cest lavantage commun et ce qui le mesure cest la libre appr ciation des services r ciproques les mots profits int r ts salaires qui expriment des nuances ne changent pas le fond des choses cest toujours le do ut des ou plut t le facio ut facias qui est la base de toute l volution humaine au point de vue conomique
8189928 comment se fait il quun si grand nombre dhommes se trouvent affranchis pour un temps et quelques uns pour toute leur vie par des salaires fixes des rentes des traitements des pensions de retraite de cette part d ventualit qui semble tre lessence m me de notre nature
8189929 le moyen de cette belle volution du genre humain cest le trait forfait pour les chances appr ciables ou labandon graduel de cette forme primitive de lassociation qui consiste attacher irr vocablement tous les associ s toutes les chances de lentreprise en dautres termes le perfectionnement de lassociation
8189930 quand deux personnes participent un risque commun ce risque existant par lui m me ne peut tre an anti mais il y a tendance ce quune de ces deux personnes sen charge forfait si le capital le prend pour son compte cest le travail dont la r mun ration se fixe sous le nom de salaire
8189931 si le salariat a t au point de vue de la stabilit une forme avanc e de lassociation entre le capital et le travail il laisse encore une trop grande place lal atoire
8189932 pour que lenvie la jalousie le simple d pit de louvrier l gard du capitaliste fussent justifiables il faudrait que la stabilit relative de lun f t une des causes de linstabilit de lautre mais cest le contraire qui est vrai et cest justement ce capital existant entre les mains dun homme qui r alise pour un autre la garantie du salaire quelque insuffisante quelle vous paraisse certes sans le capital lal atoire serait bien autrement imminent et rigoureux
8189933 quiconque se placera par la pens e au point de d part des soci t s humaines aura peine comprendre comment une multitude dhommes peuvent arriver retirer du milieu social une quantit d termin e assur e constante de moyens dexistence
8189934 il faut bien reconna tre que lincertitude le d n ment et lignorance cest le point de d part de lhumanit
8189935 lorigine des soci t s lal atoire r gne pour ainsi dire sans partage et je me suis tonn souvent que l conomie politique ait n glig de signaler les grands et heureux efforts qui ont t faits pour le restreindre dans des limites de plus en plus troites
8189936 reportons nous un tat social primitif supposons que nous disions un peuple chasseur ou p cheur ou pasteur ou guerrier ou agriculteur a mesure que vous ferez des progr s vous saurez de plus en plus davance quelle somme de jouissance vous sera assur e pour chaque ann e
8189937 les hommes aspirent avec ardeur la fixit il se rencontre bien dans le monde quelques individualit s inqui tes aventureuses pour lesquelles lal atoire est une sorte de besoin les hommes pris en masse aiment tre tranquilles sur leur avenir savoir sur quoi compter pouvoir disposer davance tous leurs arrangements
8189938 la fixit a donc pour les hommes un attrait tout puissant
8189939 et ici je ne puis memp cher de faire remarquer combien est puissant le sentiment que jinvoque dans tout le cours de cet article et dont les modernes r formateurs ne semblent pas soup onner lexistence je veux parler de laversion pour lincertitude

8189950 not surprisingly agricultural economists were among the first economists to realize the importance of risk to an understanding of the functioning of the economy and to attempt to develop formal models for analysing its consequences
8189951 in spite of its importance our understanding of the effect of risk on agricultural production remains limited this is not surprising for the concepts of risk and of risk aversion although intuitive are hard to define precisely as a result the literature has tended to employ special parametrizations
8189952 risk averters will not be satisfied to accept more risk unless they can also expect greater expected return
8189953 ce sentiment laversion pour lincertitude a rendu si facile aux d clamateurs socialistes la t che de faire prendre aux ouvriers le salaire en haine
8189954 a major theme of this lecture is the surprising fact that an increase in information may lower the efficiency of the market as first noted by hirshleifer 1971
8189955 nous avons vu quune am lioration de linformation est toujours b n fique pour un statisticien bay sien ce nest pas n cessairement le cas dans un jeu conomique
8189956 viewed from an ex ante perspective there is a net loss in social welfare from this increased prior knowledge
8189957 ricardo was fully aware of the fact that his law of comparative cost which he expounded mainly in order to deal with a special problem of international trade is a particular instance of the more universal law of association
8189958 the law of association makes us comprehend the tendencies which resulted in the progressive intensification of human cooperation we conceive what incentive induced people not to consider themselves simply as rivals in a struggle for the appropriation of the limited supply of means of subsistence made available by nature we realize what has impelled them and permanently impels them to consort with one another for the sake of cooperation
8189959 every step forward on the way to a more developed mode of the division of labor serves the interests of all participants
8189960 people cavil much about ricardos law of association better known under the name law of comparative cost
8189961 the fundamental social phenomenon is the division of labor and its counterpart human cooperation
8189962 ricardo expounded the law of association in order to demonstrate what the consequences of the division of labor are when an individual or a group more efficient in every regard cooperates with an individual or a group less efficient in every regard
8189963 the theorem of comparative cost is in no way connected to the value theory of classical economics
8189964 some critics blame the law of comparative cost for this simplification of assumptions
8189965 if we do not want to deal with the law of comparative cost under the simplified assumptions applied by ricardo we must openly employ money calculation
8189966 jusque vers 1950 on pouvait objecter aux th ories de l quilibre et de loptimum de n gliger ainsi un aspect fondamental du monde dans lequel nous vivons il tait alors difficile de savoir dans quelle mesure lhypoth se simplificatrice dabsence dincertitude affectait la port e des r sultats obtenus gr ce aux progr s r cents de la th orie des d cisions en face du risque cette importante lacune a pu tre combl e en grande partie
8189967 the role of the competitive system in allocating uncertainty seems to have received little systematic attention
8189968 the first studies i am aware of are allais 1953 and arrow 1953
8189969 quiconque a lu larticle de keynes la th orie g n rale du sous emploi paru en f vrier 1937 en r ponse aux critiques ne peut douter que keynes consid rait apr s coup que le th me principal de son livre tait limportance pr pond rante de lincertitude et des conventions gr ce auxquelles on peut rendre la vie possible en am nageant les probl mes insolubles que pose cette incertitude et le caract re dabsurdit quelle donne au calcul rationnel pur
8189970 somewhat surprisingly what has become the standard paradigm for analyzing the market economy the competitive model as exposited say by arrow 1964 and debreu 1959 systematically ignores these considerations the phenomenon of risk and insurance
8189971 il faut accorder une grande importance lincertitude comme beaucoup dautres facteurs encore si ce qui nous int resse est de d velopper une th orie satisfaisante de la composition du portefeuille ou ce qui est quivalent du taux de variation des actifs pris individuellement
8189972 uncertainty can be neglected without serious consequences in many consumer decisions but with some uncertainty is the heart of the matter consumers buy life fire theft and other insurance only because they do not know when they will die have a fire or be robbed if they did they need for insurance would vanish
8189973 in this paper i wish to explore the relationship between risk insurance incentives and imperfect information understanding the relationship between these is fundamental and not only to an understanding of the functioning of insurance markets the phenomenon of risk and insurance and the problem which they pose are pervasive throughout the economy often in quite disguised form they are many features of the economy that can best be understood as an institutional adaptation to the problems of risk and incentives
8189974 lexploit de g del fut de montrer quon peut effectivement assigner une valeur de v rit certains propositions sans avoir passer par une d monstration g del montre quil existe des propositions vraies du point de vue du m talangage quil est impossible de d montrer par une preuve de longeur finie rien ne prouve que larithm tique en d finitive soit coh rente
8189975 un nouveau langage math matique une nouvelle logique taient n cessaires et cest ce langage quils ont appel calcul des jeux de strat gie
8189976 ce nest pas laddition dune dimension de plus qui cr e la difficult cest la suppression la fin dune dimension
8189977 nous serons amen s conclure que le probl me nest pas dajouter des variables cach es ou non mais plut t den retrancher
8189978 to any who has not himself attempted to reformulate the central theorems of trade theory to accomodate elements of uncertainty it must seem quite extraordinary that such reformulation has not long been provided by others but non one who has made the attempt will be in the least surprised the recognition of uncertainty seems to have a devastating effect on many of our most cherished propositions under conditions of uncertainty long run comparative advantage is a very unreliable predictor of the competitive or optimal patterns of production and trade
8189979 as a result not only does it le paradigme standard fail to provide insights into some of the important features of modern capitalist economies but also it reaches conclusions e g concerning the efficiency of the market and the existence of equilibrium which are necessarily suspect indeed recent research which i will discuss today has shown them les r sultats quon peut d duire de la th orie de l quilibre conomique g n ral not to be generally valid
8189980 a mesure que ce d veloppement sop re il permet aux compagnies de baisser leurs prix elles y sont m me forc es par la concurrence et ici nous retrouvons la grande loi le bien glisse sur le producteur pour aller sattacher au consommateur
8189981 pour d noncer et combattre laugmentation vraiment tous azimuts de la fiscalit par le gouvernement qui comprend quil sagit dun imp t discriminatoire
8189982 ici lassurance mutuelle prime fixe verser ex ante les socialistes pr tendent que lassociation est d truite
8189983 jaffirme moi quelle est perfectionn e et sur la voie dautres perfectionnement
8189984 en effet les compagnies qui esp rent des profits proportionnels l tendue de leurs affaires poussent aux assurances ce nest pas tout les compagnies sassurent entre elles par les r assurances
8189985 mais disent les socialistes voil que les assur s nont plus aucun lien entre eux ils ne se voient plus ils nont plus sentendre des interm diaires parasites sont venus sinterposer au milieu deux et la preuve que les propri taires payent maintenant plus quil ne faut pour couvrir les sinistres cest que les assureurs r alisent de gros b n fices il est facile de r pondre cette critique
8189986 le salariat a t particuli rement en butte aux coups des socialistes peu sen faut quils ne laient signal comme une forme peine adoucie de lesclavage ou du servage en tout cas ils y ont vu une convention abusive et l onine qui na de libert que lapparence une oppression du faible par le fort une tyrannie exerc e par le capital sur la travail
8189987 la propagande socialiste second e par une presse ignorante et l che qui sans savouer socialiste nen cherchait pas moins popularit dans des d clamations la mode est parvenue faire p n trer la haine du salariat dans la classe m me des salari s les ouvriers se sont d go t s de cette forme de r mun tarion elle leur a paru injuste humiliante odieuse ils ont cru quelle les frappait du sceau de la servitude a la r volution de f vrier la grande pr occupation des ouvriers a t de se d barrasser du salaire
8189988 cest par suite des m mes pr ventions de la m me ignorance quils les socialistes d clament sans cesse soit contre lint r t soit contre le salaire formes fixes et par cons quent tr s perfectionn es de la r mun ration qui revient au capital et au travail
8189989 le salaire na en lui m me rien de d gradant rien dhumiliant pas plus que lint r t
8189990 les r formateurs modernes qui sous pr texte davoir invent lassociation voudraient nous ramener ses formes rudimentaires devraient bien nous dire en quoi les trait s forfait blessent le droit ou l quit comment ils nuisent au progr s et en vertu de quel principe ils pr tendent les interdire
8189991 arriv quand les socialistes ces grands partisans de lassociation ont eu le pouvoir ils nont rien eu de plus press que de menacer lassociation quelque forme quelle affecte et notamment lassociation des assurances et pourquoi pr cis ment parce que pour suniversaliser elle emploie ce proc d qui permet chacun de ses membres de rester dans lind pendance cest moi qui souligne tant ces malheureux socialistes comprennent peu le m canisme social
8189992 les assur s ont trouv le moyen de rester dans lassociation sans sen occuper
8189993 cest cette ind pendance des citoyens que langleterre doit certainement une partie de sa grandeur que les citoyens doivent leur exp rience et leur valeur personnelle que le gouvernement doit son irresponsabilit relative et par suite sa stabilit
8189994 lobservation relative laccroissement de la mutuelle d pendance des individus le fait admis par tout le monde de laccroissement de la d pendance
8189995 nous devons seulement faire une observation sur la cons quence que les coles socialistes tirent de lobservation relative laccroissement de la mutuelle d pendance des individus
8189996 at a fundamental level the essential contribution of information technology to this process is the expansion of knowledge and its obverse the reduction in uncertainty

8189998 although the principal agent model the principal agent model first introduced by stiglitz 1974 has been extended and broadly applied see holmstrom 1979 1982 dewatripont 1989 freixas et al 1985 or shavell 1979 for examples it has recently fallen out of favor for models where all parties are risk neutral see grossman and hart 1986 eswaran and kotwal 1985 leffler and rucker 1991 and allen and lueck 1992a for examples
8189999 economic theory has suffered in the past from a failure to state clearly its assumptions economists in building up a theory have often omitted to examine the foundations on which it was erected
