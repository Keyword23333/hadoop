6430018 while serotonin has something to do with depression the relationship is not a simple nor a well understood one while the ssris do indeed act on serotonin regulation in the brain allowing the neurotransmitter to linger a little longer in the synapses the changes that the drug ultimately exerts on the brain are entirely unclear as an indicator of how little we know it is striking that one of the more popular antidepressants in europe tianeptine is a serotonin reuptake enhancer it has the opposite effect of the ssris allowing less serotonin to flow between the synapses

6430021 such a programme will cater for the very basic needs in form of information and education for seafarers when it comes to hiv aids these people are very vulnerable as most information does not reach them due to their extended length of stay at sea

6430023 i got married over seventeen years ago and since then i have never had extramarital sex
6430024 this implies that we must have been negative when we got married but later on when my wife was pregnant two years ago she tested positive and i was advised to have a test which came out positive

6430026 and could move to another place where they are not known

6430028 if what is needed today is disclosure then where does the right to privacy and confidentiality lie
6430029 but the burden of proof in issues where the various modes of transmission are usually practiced in privacy with individuals who are not minors by the law of the particular country and it was not rape or defilement because the consent of the parties existed
6430030 cases of intentional transmission i e where a person knows his or her hiv positive status acts with the intention to transmit hiv and does in fact transmit it
6430031 there are no data indicating that the broad application of criminal law to hiv transmission will achieve either criminal justice or prevent hiv transmission rather such application risks undermining public health and human rights
6430032 instead of applying criminal law to hiv transmission governments should expand programmes which have been proven to reduce hiv transmission while protecting the human rights both of people living with hiv and those who are hiv negative
6430033 strengthen and enforce laws against rape inside and outside marriage and other forms of violence against women and children improve the efficacy of criminal justice systems in investigating and prosecuting sexual offences against women and children and support womens equality and economic independence including through concrete legislation programmes and services

6430055 the candidate republicans should be clamoring for is the one liberals are most feverishly denouncing that is mitt romney by a landslide

6430057 prominent evangelical leaders are warning sen john mccain against picking former massachusetts gov mitt romney as his running mate saying their troops will abandon the republican ticket on election day if that happens
6430058 they say mr romney lacks trust on issues such as outlawing abortion and opposing same sex marriage and because he is a mormon opposition is particularly powerful among those who supported former arkansas gov mike huckabee in the republican presidential primaries earlier this year other well placed christian conservatives say that although many evangelical leaders could accept and work for a mccain romney ticket mr huckabees supporters tend to be rabid in their views against mr romney because of his faith they do not regard mormonism as a christian denomination
6430059 i am wholeheartedly convinced that mitt romney can be trusted to uphold the values and principles most important to me as a political conservative and an evangelical christian again i am not being paid and i am not interested in a job in a romney administration i would not accept one even if offered as im still raising three teenagers neither is my public relations firm involved in any way i am involved because i believe the stakes are high perhaps higher than ever before in my life

6430076 the ability to respond to prose and poetry hasnt entirely disappeared but it has been dulled this is a dicey business to discuss there are many people who still depend on novels and poems for enjoyment and intellectual stimulation and they tend to dismiss someone who feels differently clearly im either depressed or i just dont get it thing is im not on meds and since i believe that i do get joyce pound beckett larkin and auden i also believe that im able to appreciate what novelists and poets are doing today and yet very little strikes my fancy i cant prove it but i think the fault lies in the literary firmament and not in me
6430077 closing the books a devoted reader arrives at the end of the story
6430078 what happened to the capacity to feel the possibilities in books to answer this i have to summon up the way books used to make me feel and when i consider the eagerness with which i set out to read everything i could and how a peculiar book like djuna barness nightwood once made me whistle in amazement it seems to me that a necessary component of the literary life is a certain romantic attachment to life itself but life is not very romantic these days im not sure it ever was but at least in the days before the media transformed the nature of existence by devaluing the idea of privacy a writers imaginative powers and a readers imaginative responses were shaped by a real sense of possibility the greater world being further removed from the ordinary individual required an imaginative leap to bring it home and when the imagination succeeded through print or pigment one felt the jolt the power of art to transfigure ones life
6430079 a necessary component of the literary life is a certain romantic attachment to life itself
6430080 here is the crux absurdly simple once you have made the acquaintance of truly interesting minds minds such as montaignes shakepeares goethes swifts diderots nietzsches mallarm s dostoevskys wildes even if you disagree with some of their ideas and even if you detect signs of ingrained cultural bias what do the novels and poems of today have to offer other than implicit commentary on their antecedents another way of saying this is the best is the enemy of the good and once you have become acquainted with the former why bother with the rest
6430081 reading auden on dostoevsky or trilling on henry james and then reading lacan on poe or derrida on baudelaire is the difference between visiting florence on a fine spring day and being stuck on a bus in bosnia herzegovina in the dead of winter without a coat with nothing to eat etc the point is not that i stopped appreciating criticism i simply stopped reading turgid self important aggressively abstruse criticism
6430082 seeing greg barnhill professional looking in khakis and a button down dress shirt its hard to imagine him as a country boy on a farm outside west union ohio thats exactly what barnhill was though and he still has great regard for the small town way of life its evident in his passion for the older homes and sense of community in seminole heights where he helped organize the neighborhoods first home tour and has been integral in restoring its garden center building

6430085 we dismissed everybody and we conferenced with our county attorney while we discussed the issue
6430086 the board came out and took the action monday night as a part of the action the board directed the county attorney and the county chair to meet with macon as soon as possible first thing tuesday morning face to face due to schedules we were able to meet yesterday tuesday afternoon and late yesterday afternoon we did the termination the board appreciates macons four and a half years of service but the board has decided to pursue new leadership
6430087 i can tell you that the county board appreciates the years of service that macon has put in but it was a unanimous decision that we go in a different direction
6430088 we appreciate his almost five years of work with surry county
6430089 particularly the way the county is set up in north carolina it is different from the town manager outline the county is set up where the commissioners are responsible for running the county business and the county manager is just the agent for the commissioners it is very hard particularly when you are carrying all these functions out because it requires a lot of thought you dont want to get out ahead of people and it is important to represent the consensus of the board and it is not always clear what that is
6430090 i have both enjoyed and greatly appreciated many fine working relationships with local officials county employees and citizens
6430091 it has been an honor and a pleasure to serve our community and our people candace his wife and i appreciate our many good friends and neighbors we have come to love surry county and well continue to be involved in charitable civic and church activities
6430092 white people of european descent will no longer make up a majority of the us population by the year 2042 eight years sooner than previous estimates the projections show that the us population is expected to rise from 305 million people to 439 million by 2050 but it will be a population that looks quite different both in age race and ethnicity according to the census bureaus statistics people who regard themselves as hispanic african american asian american indian native hawaiian and pacific islander will become the majority by 2042 officials had previously projected that this change would happen in 2050 the new projections suggestion that by 2050 minorities will account for 54 of the population and non hispanic whites 46 down from their current 64 7 share immigration and higher birth rates among us minorities especially hispanics are accelerating the demographic changes

6430095 its a wonder to me how when the numbers finally turn turtle stabilize and we become the minority immigrants and their descendants will be able to continue to live off the state in all the comfort of their overpaid quango sinecure non jobs welfare benefit subsidized retirement from the work force and artificial racial meritocracy the private companies wont be competitive without properly qualified and motivated work forces and the bankrupt government will not be able to afford the social security pay outs because the taxes will not be forthcoming from the squeezed natives having out bred the geese that were laying the golden eggs their only alternative will be to bleed their own kind white maybe unleashing the sort of bloody backlash that we are so carefully trying to avoid will we have to follow the celts into the hills and thence into the sunset i sincerely hope not
6430096 with the constitution the law and the politics on the side of doing his duty and securing our broken border why does president bush not act what is paralyzing the white house answer political correctness political cowardice political opportunism a sense of guilt for americas sins that has a grip on our elites not unlike a religious cult

6430100 khodorkovsky has spent years pursuing what is essentially a personal pro american foreign policy cultivating contacts with the most influential politicians diplomats bankers and public relations specialists in washington actions the siloviki a group of hawks in the kremlin made up of former kgb men consider reprehensible
6430101 compounding this perceived threat are khodorkovskys efforts to endear himself to the white house one only need look at the people who have rallied to khodorkovskys defense the article mentions stuart eizenstat richard perle george soros and john mccain to see how the siloviki could make a convincing case to cut khodorkovsky down to size

6430104 if asked to be vice president would you say no
6430105 you want me to answer that one well i dont think i dont think im going to be asked its a hypothetical
6430106 liebermans appeal is that he could help mccain with independent voters
6430107 a tremendous experience that senator mccain has his record for bipartisanship his willingness to take on his own party is so much stronger than senator barack obama s
6430108 i cant imagine joe lieberman being on the ticket and i think john mccain knows that while republicans could accept joe lieberman as secretary of defense or secretary of state thats fine republicans want to elect a republican not only to be president but to be in the position should something happen and be the next president
6430109 if he were to select lieberman i think that by them going and saying ill only serve one term it mitigates the advantages of having lieberman on the ticket i mean on the one hand youve got lieberman there which would be a move towards the center trying to get these independent votes and some democrats and on the other hand you have im only going to serve one term which just highlights the age issue goes to the idea of youre not going to be able to get much done there wont be much in the way of change i think those two things fight each other if he were to go with lieberman id be very surprised if he decided to announce that he was only going to serve for one term
6430110 he ought to i dont think he will but if he wanted to change the dynamics of this entire race thats the place he needs to go because it brings the democrats together and brings the wow factor that he had at one time and he does not have it right now hes more interested in winning than he is in his pride i think it would be very very difficult for him to make that decision but i do believe that thats the one person that sort of just takes everybodys breath away
6430111 i think that choosing hillary clinton is very painful for obama but it could be the pragmatic choice and one thing that people say about barack obama is hes not an emotional decision maker and he is able to take decisions which are personally painful for him but are politically the right ones what hillary brings oddly enough is somewhat shes machismo to the ticket and what obama i think needs right now is someone who is willing to go out there and fight mccain and hillary is the person who could do that
6430112 the downside of hillary clinton what they say is she would really by being on the ticket bring out that republican base and do for john mccain what maybe he cant do for himself
6430113 i can imagine just getting the message yo its hrc lol and then you got to say wtf
6430114 if you talk to most of your friends from those days they say that john mccain post vietnam is a different person he was more serious he was more dedicated he was focused on getting back in a plane you hear that from 99 out of 100 the one person who has a different perspective was your wife at the time who says john mccain came back and i needed him to be 40 and he wanted to be 25 what happened
6430115 i take full responsibility for the break up of my first marriage and im very grateful for the fact that carol and i have a good relationship
6430116 and how does it sit with you to those who have over the years have said john mccain comes home from vietnam you know leaves his wife then marries this younger beautiful wealthy woman
6430117 at the time i didnt really understand what they were saying because my husband had been separated and 6 1 2 years it was a long separation

6430119 oh she was spectacular she was an only child she had traveled a lot growing up you know she was born in wichita kansas my grandparents were from small towns in kansas she was a really loving sweet person she was somebody who had very clear ideas about what was right and what was wrong she had no patience for bigotry she had no patience for intolerance
6430120 one of the things that i always knew was that i was the center of her world and ive always believed that if kids know theyre loved if they know that in their parents eyes they are special that can make up for a lot of instability and a lot of change and thats what she was always able to transmit to me

6430122 unfortunately i dont yet have access to the documents the special collections section of the richard j daley library agreed to let me read them but just before i boarded my flight to chicago the top library officials mysteriously intervened to bar access circumstances strongly suggest the likelihood that bill ayers himself may have played a pivotal role in this denial ayers has long taught at uic where the chicago annenberg challenge offices were housed rent free ayers likely arranged for the files of the chicago annenberg challenge to be housed in the uic library and may well have been consulted during my unsuccessful struggle to gain access to the documents let me then explain in greater detail what the chicago annenberg challenge cac records are and how i have been blocked from seeing them

6430169 lets just say that i was myself very tolerant just a couple of years or so back but by now my patience is wearing thin to say at least today i wish i had never even heard about islam or muslims in fact im so sick and tired of these a holes that are using the system against us thus making whole nations to rot from within gladly supported by pc politicians and media we the peoples of europe are now second rate citizens in our own countries never let them grow as strong in your country as they have here if that happens they will rob you all blind by suing the crap out of you as we all now they can make a lot more money on suing in the states than here in europe and they will do it if they get the chance i wouldnt be too surprised if you will have to save us from ourselves yet another time quite frankly i dont think you have much choice if they take over certain countries then they will suddenly have a lot of nukes and france and uk are among the countries most infested with these lunatics
6430170 it would appear as though there was a minor traffic incident with this second vehicle a few minutes earlier and that this purple coloured intrepid followed the person for a considerable distance to where the shooting took place
6430171 it doesnt bother the doctors as much as it bothers the athlete
6430172 id be more concerned about running a similar olympics in denver

6430174 i think the concern was raised appropriately ahead of time

6430176 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6430177 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6430178 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6430179 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6430180 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6430181 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6430194 john knows all my curators on a first name basis
6430195 when he was simply a restaurant owner and brewer he gave beer to all our events
6430196 now when i hear him talk about clyfford still who in my view is the most important american painter of the 20th century i know that he gets it right to his core
6430197 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
6430198 justice thomass judicial credentials compare favorably to mr obamas presidential r sum by any measure and when it comes to rising from difficult circumstances justice thomass rural georgian upbringing makes mr obamas story look like easy street
6430199 whats the most gut wrenching decision youve ever had to make and what was the process you used to make it
6430200 i was firmly convinced at the time that we did not have strong evidence of weapons of mass destruction
6430201 he has repeatedly defied un resolutions thwarted un inspection teams developed chemical and biological weapons and coveted nuclear capacity
6430202 what i am opposed to is the attempt by political hacks like karl rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsured a rise in the poverty rate a drop in the median income to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock market that has just gone through the worst month since the great depression thats what im opposed to
6430203 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
6430204 in overall political stories from june 4 to friday obama dominated by 142 to 96 obama has been featured in 35 stories on page 1 mccain has been featured in 13 with three page 1 references with photos to stories on inside pages
6430205 its latest report for the week of aug 4 10 shows that for the eighth time in nine weeks obama received significantly more coverage than mccain
6430206 we make our own decisions about what we consider newsworthy
6430207 the nomination of the first african american presidential nominee after a bitter primary campaign and his efforts to unite a party afterward were simply more newsworthy than a candidate whose nomination was already assured and who spent much of that time raising money
6430208 numbers arent everything in political coverage but readers deserve comparable coverage of the candidates
6430209 he was not convinced that human exploration was worth the cost
6430210 lets be honest obama is only embracing nasa now because of his political problems in florida
6430211 alirezaei swims in lane one and the representative of the zionist regime israel in lane seven so they will not face each other
6430212 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
6430213 the army is too easy for me and i have no reason to get out
6430214 but its really hard to change my military occupational specialty because theres not a lot of people in my mos
6430215 this is completely different than doing anything in normal artillery
6430216 talking to longbow apache helicopter pilots is different than anything else in the artillery branch i have to take into consideration air to ground integration and put myself into the pilots position i have to create a clear picture in their minds before they can attack the enemy
6430217 its great having him because he has training related to artillery rounds
6430218 it helps to have someone who has more knowledge and he can pass it down to my other soldiers as well
6430219 hes extended his time in the army so we know hes committed to doing what hes here for
6430220 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
6430221 abbott achieved another quarter of strong performance across our diverse mix of global businesses with particularly strong results internationally
6430222 based on our first half results as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year were raising our 2008 forecast for both sales growth and earnings per share were also confirming our expectation for continued double digit earnings per share growth in 2009
6430223 in the current housing market it has become increasingly difficult to sell property and unfortunately a worrying number of desperate sellers are resorting to hiding problems rather than paying money to have these problems rectified
6430224 buyers should thoroughly inspect the property before making an offer ask sellers to move furniture lift floor coverings and check that heating water and electricity is in working order
6430225 we know of no society that has ever achieved prosperity and freedom unless voluntary exchange has been its dominant principle of organization
6430226 there is certainly no question that an obama administration is a frightening prospect for free market advocates
6430227 this self described free market guy has said he opposes the central american free trade agreement cafta and will reopen the north american free trade agreement nafta
6430228 he would sign legislation raising the minimum wage and ending secret balloting for workers deciding on unionization
6430229 he would require employers to pay for health insurance for their workers mandate coverage for all children and expand medicaid and other government programs he wants higher fuel economy standards for new cars and trucks power companies to produce some of electricity from solar and renewable sources and federal ethanol mandates
6430230 in each instance when the rate dropped revenues from the tax increased the government took in more money and in the 1980s when the tax was increased to 28 percent the revenues went down so why raise it at all given the fact that 100 million people in this country own stock and would be affected
6430231 well charlie what ive said is that i would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness
6430232 but history shows that when you drop the capital gains tax the revenues go up
6430233 iranian and syrian support to islamist salafist groups is not new
6430234 for years tehran has been funding sunni islamists in lebanon and since 2003 syria has been shipping jihadi salafists to iraq from lebanon
6430235 the latest media show the memorandum of understanding is only the official stamp on this collaboration
6430236 we had a few occasional 3g signal dropping troubles at some locations especially on high rises building streets amp on our 34th floor edge picked up immediately but slower internet speeds
6430237 you dont want it to end this way but its all we could do
6430238 i love your mouth and i love your smile it totally melts me
6430239 they have inside jokes and write sexy little things hes totally in love
6430240 they are addicted to e mailing each other thats what teenagers do
6430241 i had dinner on the beach with a crush and there were lights on the palm trees
6430242 on one date the girl said to me i dont kiss on the first date
6430243 he told the entire student body that he had shared her info with a sexual predator in prison
6430244 mod sed is much more than a mere string or regexp search and gt replace
6430245 well dont you know obama a baby when you see one and when it comes to abortion man would you rather see than be one
6430246 just how glad are you obama that they didnt abort your father
6430247 whatsoever you have done to the least of these my brothers we do for christ and to the christ what we do for others
6430248 and the king will answer them truly i say to you as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers you did it to me
6430249 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6430250 in the present standard he was a pervert but during his time and in his society he was comparatively a good person because people were not sparing even their own mother mothers sisters own grown up sisters and other family members the prophet had to prevent them from such uncontrolled sexual perversion like animals by introducing provisions into koran whom to marry and whom not to marry he had to bring their own tribe to a decent human level with a code of conduct as if it were told by allah to him the whole thing has to be seen in its proper context then only we can properly appreciate
6430251 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6430252 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6430253 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6430254 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6430255 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6430256 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6430257 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6430258 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6430259 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6430260 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6430261 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6430262 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6430263 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6430264 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6430265 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6430266 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6430267 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6430268 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
6430269 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6430270 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6430271 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6430272 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6430273 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6430274 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6430275 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6430276 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6430277 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6430278 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6430279 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6430280 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6430281 companies will build two solar power plants in california that together will put out more than 12 times as much electricity as the largest such plant today the latest indication that solar energy is starting to achieve significant scale
6430282 i t may be typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement
6430283 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6430284 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6430285 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6430286 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6430287 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6430288 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6430289 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6430290 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6430291 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6430292 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6430293 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6430294 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6430295 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6430296 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6430297 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6430298 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6430299 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6430300 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6430301 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6430302 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6430303 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6430304 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6430305 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6430306 we suffer from a fiscal cancer it is growing inside us
6430307 our country would need 53 trillion invested today which is about 175 000 per person to deliver on the governments obligations and promises how much of this 53 trillion do we have zip
6430308 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6430309 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6430310 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6430311 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6430312 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6430313 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6430314 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6430315 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6430316 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6430317 we are committed to continue to give that support for a long long time from now
6430318 it is the end of all hope and it is when we see the worst scenes because the majority of the relatives break down when they hear the news

6430375 mit enormen engagement flei arbeitseinsatz und hoher risikobereitschaft haben die beiden unternehmer in den letzten zwei jahren den hof ziegenland auf dem gel nde eines ehemaligen depots der bundeswehr in j bek ohne inanspruchnahme ffentlicher f rdermittel aufgebaut und haben derzeit keine landwirtschaftliche f rderung beantragt

6430379 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the uk where we can do that
6430380 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children
6430381 we dont live in a flood zone but it just came in and came in and came in
6430382 the storm continues to be a threat to this community
6430383 is producing historic flooding across a large portion of brevard county
6430384 fay has and will continue to produce copious amounts of rain over a large portion of northeast florida as the storm turns westward on august 21
6430385 they sent a warning to everyone not to leave their homes because the snakes are coming out of their holes and theres fish everywhere
6430386 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything i dont anticipate they will do that
6430387 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6430388 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6430389 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6430390 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6430391 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6430392 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6430393 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6430394 of how much impact a free social media driven campaign can have on the general population to raise awareness and maybe even money
6430395 it does not take a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men
6430396 if ever a time should come when vain and aspiring men shall possess the highest seats in government our country will stand in need of its experienced patriots to prevent its ruin
6430397 i told our members that its just another tool that we can use to get the play right not to look at it as a negative but a positive
6430398 as hard as you try as much as you hustle sometimes with just the landscape of the ballparks nowadays its hard to tell so if we can get it right you know what lets use it as a tool to get it right
6430399 we reached an agreement final decision with respect to moving ahead has not been made yet but we have an agreement with the umpires
6430400 were going to move forward with the understanding the sides will come to the table later and iron out some of the remaining issues
6430401 sorry coach the runner has to go back to second upon further review the ball was foul
6430402 we believe that this will establish the psp as a viable communication device
6430403 the more carbs and sugars you eat the more your appetite control cells are damaged and potentially you consume more
6430404 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
6430405 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
6430406 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
6430407 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that its leading to premature cell deterioration
6430408 muito tempo depois do patriarcado se haver tornado dominante em todas as esferas ainda encontramos a concep o matriarcal segundo a qual os c us e os mundos giram em torno da
6430409 a gua o leite vital do corpo do mundo e o espa o c smico um mar de leite
6430410 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
6430411 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
6430412 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
6430413 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
6430414 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
6430415 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
6430416 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
6430417 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production
6430418 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6430419 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6430420 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6430421 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6430422 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6430423 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6430424 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6430425 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6430426 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6430427 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6430428 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6430429 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6430430 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6430431 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6430432 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6430433 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6430434 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6430435 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6430436 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6430437 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6430438 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6430439 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6430440 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6430441 praw r k ci pogro zdrajco a nie lew zima wasza a wiosna nasza czy widzisz to drzewo
6430442 its over i would rather have the marbergs receive community service but this actually might deter them from any further pranks getting out of hand
6430443 a lot of people do come in and say wheres the bird in the newspaper its very social now its a little pudgy thing
6430444 zastosujemy powa ne rodki wycelujemy pociski w polsk w tym nuklearne itp
6430445 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6430446 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6430447 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6430448 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6430449 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6430450 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6430451 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6430452 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6430453 i think the team just came together the first time we played them cuba kicked our butts but that didnt deter us
6430454 we always fight we came together as one unit when we first started playing we played individually it was ugly and we made a lot of errors
6430455 the us team played very well however we didnt especially on service and reception
6430456 there were two points that differed from the preliminary game where cuba did very well on serve and reception
6430457 the us did it very well and we didnt they were very well prepared and played to their potential
6430458 my teammates had enough confidence in me to set me the ball to win the match and i was just thinking is this me did i just do that
6430459 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6430460 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6430461 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6430462 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6430463 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6430464 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6430465 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6430466 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6430467 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6430468 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6430469 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play
6430470 captures the guitarists as each explains and demonstrates how he changed the sound of the electric guitar to suit his own distinctive musical style
6430471 i had several glasses of tiverton dark and premium lager while chatting with jim kindree from the revived steelback brewery who told me about the companys reduced line and the return of former brewery head name not worthy of mention in any respectable forum who has apparently found a sucker to financially back his return to the beer business

6430489 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6430490 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6430491 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6430492 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6430493 she was a stray but she worked her way up

6430497 its reflective of whats going on in the rest of the country
6430498 se ha pasado el verano lanzando ocurrencias sin sentido sobre la asignatura de educaci n para la ciudadan a y el aprendizaje de ingl s en las escuelas
6430499 de tanto buscar el titular se ha ido complicando la vida hasta anunciar medidas que en pocos d as se ha demostrado que eran un puro enga o
6430500 anunci a bombo y platillo el pasado 5 de agosto que los alumnos estudiar an ingl s desde los tres a os a partir del pr ximo curso y ahora se comprueba que s lo ser en algunos centros y a partir de los cuatro
6430501 la nula credibilidad de font de mora ha quedado en evidencia
6430502 desde esquerra unida manifestamos nuestro escepticismo porque sab amos que no se han tomado las medidas y los recursos necesarios para garantizar la incorporaci n de un tercer idioma en la educaci n infantil de todos los alumnos
6430503 ahora esto queda en evidencia pues la resoluci n publicada en el docv afirma que la aplicaci n de los programas de educaci n pluriling e desde el segundo ciclo de la educaci n infantil se har gradualmente
6430504 por el momento s lo es una opci n a la que se pueden adherir los centros pero con la restricci n de que en caso alguno se aumentar la plantilla
6430505 contin a dudando del impacto real de la medida m s all de su efecto propagand stico porque est claro que el pr ximo curso 2008 2009 no habr suficiente profesorado para impartir ingl s en todos los centros educativos de infantil y primaria tal y como marca la loe
6430506 ya veremos cuantos ni os y ni as tienen finalmente acceso a esa educaci n triling e
6430507 s lo ser real para ciertos colegios de lite que ya cuentan con profesorado y recursos propios
6430508 hablar de triling ismo cuando lo nico que se plantea es una hora y media a la semana de ingl s para los alumnos de cuatro y cinco a os
6430509 hacen falta m s hechos y menos palabras y sobre todo di logo con la comunidad educativa padres y madres y docentes que son los que conocen la realidad de la ense anza
6430510 nuevas muestras de la p sima gesti n de los recursos
6430511 adjudicar las vacunas por concurso negociado sin publicidad por un valor de 5 millones de euros
6430512 pero a la conselleria de sanidad le debe sobrar el dinero para malgastarlo de esta manera
6430513 despilfarro continuo tanto en farmacia como en cualquier otro tipo de gasto por parte de este departamento
6430514 cervera no se preocupa de ahorrar ni un c ntimo de los recursos de todos los valencianos
6430515 after each battle of the tournament i felt better and better the semifinal was very difficult and the final as well
6430516 tigiyev is a very good sportsman and we know each other very well at the end of the second period i was under a huge amount of pressure
6430517 for this moment im not feeling that i have won the gold maybe i will feel that once im back to my motherland
6430518 ha comenzado una caza de brujas contra el ala dura del presidente de la diputaci n y del pp de castell n
6430519 el n cleo m s recalcitrante de fabra est muy preocupado ante el descabezamiento que camps va a emprender
6430520 quiere deshacerse de fabra porque no se enuflexiona incondicionalmente al igual que ocurre con el presidente del pp de alicante jos joaqu n ripoll que representa el ltimo basti n zaplanista en la comunitat
6430521 representan un claro obst culo en las obsesiones pol ticas de camps
6430522 pretende cristalizar sus ambiciones de hegemon a en el partido libr ndose de fabra y su vieja guardia para sumar m ritos y auparse hasta madrid
6430523 reforz su liderazgo con el apoyo de fabra que le ayud a arrinconar a los zaplanistas en la pugna que manten an por el poder
6430524 ha conseguido desplazar la sombra de zaplana a unos pocos reductos en castell n y alicante
6430525 no tiene nada que ver con la regeneraci n del partido sino todo lo contrario
6430526 yo lo ve a y ella me lo dec a que le controlaba el m vil y esas cosas
6430527 what can i say im the luckiest girl in the world she is officially off the market no one else gets her and now shell cook and clean for me
6430528 the love we felt from the people surrounding us and the love we have for each other made it the most beautiful and emotional day its one that well never forget
6430529 i have to get back to work this is it
6430530 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6430531 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6430532 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6430533 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6430534 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6430535 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6430536 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6430537 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6430538 there was fire from machine guns on american planes that were guided by american special forces and we have no information that enables us to consider that the french soldiers were killed under fire from nato planes
6430539 human rights watch hrw researchers documented additional russian cluster munitions attacks during the conflict in georgia refuting russias earlier denials that it used the weapon
6430540 many more people could be killed or wounded unless russia allows professional demining organisations to enter at once to clean affected areas
6430541 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him

6430547 ser un fin de semana m s triste de lo que deber a para un gp nuevo
6430548 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6430549 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6430550 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6430551 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6430552 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6430553 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6430554 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6430555 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6430556 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6430557 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6430558 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6430559 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6430560 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6430561 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6430562 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6430563 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6430564 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6430565 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6430566 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6430567 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6430568 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6430569 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6430570 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6430571 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6430572 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6430573 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6430574 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6430575 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6430576 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6430577 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6430578 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6430579 we would not deploy the iphone 3g in our business until the product is proven in a business environment
6430580 je ne peux pas assurer que je ne me droguerai plus
6430581 mon m decin me dit que je fonctionne en essayant toujours de fuir
6430582 getting in the water can help athletes move from good to gold
6430583 for 20 plus years water has been a part of our training weve seen less than one percent incidence rate of stress fractures and know that can be attributed to this kind of alternative training in the pool
6430584 as an example i personally coached mike miller two time olympic trials competitor in the 1500 800 and a sub four minute miler we used aquatic training with a huge degree of success with him
6430585 the athletic enhancement via aquatic exercise symposium is a unique forum for coaches and professional trainers who do not work in the aquatics field and are looking for new ways to enhance their athletes performance
6430586 we are excited to sponsor this first ever event slated for wednesday october 15th at the u s olympic training center colorado springs colorado
6430587 as a retired marine who is still very much involved with the military and who has seen first hand what war does to young men and women physically and psychologically im passionate about caringbridge i believe it is crucial for our wounded military personnel to be able to communicate with their loved ones around the world it not only relieves pressure on those undergoing medical treatment but it also allows families comrades and friends to help
6430588 r lee ermey isnt an actor who has played a marine he is a marine hes been there and experienced the wounds of war he is the perfect person to deliver messages of hope to families who want so desperately to help and offer support to their loved ones who are recovering from critical injuries
6430589 the business of e retail has been defined as the sale of goods and services via internet or other electronic channels for personal or household use by consumers
6430590 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6430591 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6430592 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6430593 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6430594 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6430595 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6430596 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6430597 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6430598 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6430599 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6430600 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands

6430609 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6430610 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6430611 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6430612 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6430613 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6430614 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6430615 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6430616 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6430617 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6430618 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6430619 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6430620 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6430621 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6430622 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree

6430624 despite high praise from audience members critically acclaimed performances and the release of the much anticipated cast recording we have made the difficult decision to close the show in london a few weeks earlier than originally planned both the knock on effect of the current economic climate as well as disappointing ticket sales throughout the summer months have contributed to our decision to close early

6430654 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies

6430657 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6430658 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do

6430667 and for former democratic presidential candidate john edwards and obama to go out there and criticize hillary would she would she plays the victim better than anybody does and she could make real hay out of that so theyve got their wives out there ripping her

6430673 it is notable that the test vehicles gross vehicle weight of over 77 000 lbs and engine load factor to idle time of 97 7 are both higher than the national truck fleet averages
6430674 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6430675 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen

6430687 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6430688 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6430689 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6430690 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6430691 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6430692 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6430693 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6430694 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance

6430713 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6430714 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6430715 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

6430734 if david has been spotted at sunderland he didnt wear that disguise i told him to
6430735 its no secret that sunderland admire david and have talked about a transfer hes up there for a medical today
6430736 well see what happens now but its certainly a possibility the transfer could go through
6430737 neither myself nor managing director alistair mackintosh have recently been contacted by any club regarding jimmy bullard
6430738 the only club i know that have made any contact at least with myself was wigan maybe five weeks ago
6430739 i find it strange that jimmy is being linked with moves in the press when no clubs are making offers for him
6430740 it bothers me whats going on behind the scenes here because certainly we arent receiving any bids
6430741 jimmy has told me hes happy to get his head down and stay so i dont understand whats going on
6430742 andys injury has improved immensely and hes quite close to full fitness clinically hes very close
6430743 due to the transfer taking a long time and everton not using him in pre season out of fear he might become injured he hasnt had much chance to get match fit
6430744 the chances are that we will use the three week period we have between arsenal and bolton to make sure we get him in tip top condition
6430745 im very concerned that the season has just begun and there are 38 matches to be played
6430746 its important for me to have andy up running and fit for most of those matches
6430747 i dont want to throw him in early because its the tempting thing to do
6430748 as often happens with these type of injuries the player gets back and theres a slight recurrence and he misses another couple of weeks
6430749 oina este un joc pentru persoane inteligente trebuie sa si gandesti nu doar sa alergi
6430750 m a frapat ideea ca avem un sport national si mi am tot intrebat prietenii daca au auzit despre oina daca stiu de cineva care a jucat sau joaca pana cand am ajuns la o persoana care stia despre ce e vorba si o ora intreaga am agasat o cu intrebari despre reguli apoi am cautat pe internet si am aflat ca exista o federatie m am dus la un meci si pe parcursul a trei ani de atunci am fost nelipsit de la toate competitiile
6430751 oina este un joc pentru persoane inteligente trebuie sa si gandesti nu doar sa alergi
6430752 in prima repriza o echipa este la bataie si face puncte aruncand mingea cat mai departe si cealalta este la prindere si face puncte prinzand mingea
6430753 trebuie sa dai pase foarte precise foarte rapide sa tintesti cat mai bine adversarul sa ai reflexe foarte bune daca esti in rolul celui care se apara te poti apara de loviturile mingii de oina doar cu palmele cand vezi un joc de oina te prinde nu poti sa stai pe margine sa ramai impasibil te atrage nu este un joc plictisitor si nici violent in sensul in care te poti alege cu maxim 2 3 vanatai daca mingea a fost aruncata puternic
6430754 sunt cateva echipe care au fost reformate dupa 15 20 de ani de la disparitia lor de niste inimosi care se intretin cu banii de buzunar cateva dintre ele sunt ale ministerului internelor si reformei administrative mira formate din politisti si jandarmi si sunt echipele rasfatate ale oinei pentru ca multe dintre cheltuielile lor sunt suportate de minister majoritatea echipelor insa sunt echipe satesti nu sunt echipe ale unor cluburi de renume sunt echipe formate din localnici oameni cat se poate de obisnuiti pe care ii uneste doar dragostea fata de acest joc si de multe ori fac sacrificii ca sa vina la cele cateva competitii fiind echipe satesti din fericire au la dispozitie islazuri sau terenuri comunale cele ale mira au de obicei propria baza de pregatire fizica ale unitatilor militare in care lucreaza terenul nu reprezinta o problema insa trebuie mentionat ca sportul nostru national nu are nicio baza sportiva dedicata lui nici in bucuresti nici altundeva in tara ceea ce este putin ridicol
6430755 pe timpul verii suspendam antrenamentele din cauza concediilor iar pe timpul iernii inchiriem o sala de sport din banii de buzunar din fericire nu suntem putini speram ca din toamna asta sa ne inregistram ca club sportiv si sa ne afiliem la federatie pentru a putea participa in competitii
6430756 foarte putine echipe au tineri si in special cele din moldova pentru ca au fost acolo cativa profesori care au participat la olimpiade si la fel si in baia mare
6430757 este un cerc vicios universitatile sunt autonome si isi aleg materiile in functie de cererea pietei iar studentii cum nu cunosc nimic despre oina nu au cum sa ceara sa faca un astfel de curs
6430758 pentru ca a fost uitata oina a fost ignorata pentru ca sunt celelalte sporturi mai bine platite mai mediatizate pentru care se organizeaza competitii internationale oina se joaca doar la nivel national si din aceasta cauza jucatorii se simt oarecum frustrati pentru ca ei nu au posibilitatea de a face deplasari in strainatate de a juca cu echipe straine de a si reprezenta tara nu stiu de ce nu se gasesc solutii pentru a contracara acest dezavantaj sunt destule tari europene care au sporturi specifice si care se joaca practice doar pe plan local cum ar fi irlanda sau anglia sau finlanda strainii isi practica sporturile nationale cu foarte multa fervoare inca de la gradinita scoala primara si pana la seniori si batrani o fac numai din placere si din mandrie chiar daca sunt foarte slab platiti comparativ cu alte sporturi
6430759 sunt si femei care joaca oina si sunt unele care joaca foarte bine in special cele care joaca si handbal
6430760 ca se pastreaza o continuitate a lor si asta este un germene pentru ca oina sa renasca exista un nucleu de jucatori un nucleu de arbitri potentiali antrenori si de asemenea exista cativa inimosi care sustin echipele multi dintre ei nu au nicio tangenta cu educatia fizica sau cu sportul unii sunt profesori de geografie de limba romana dar sunt uniti de dragostea pentru acest sport sau mai bine spus semnificatia lui din fericire ministerul educatiei si cercetarii organizeaza o competitie scolara cea mai ampla de altfel pentru ca toate cheltuielile de cazare transport si organizare sunt acoperite de minister sub forma unui campionat national de oina in cadrul olimpiadei sportului scolar desi cuprinde doar grupa de varsta 10 14 ani participa peste 15 echipe si este competitia care formeaza jucatori participantii la campionatul national de oina organizat de minister sunt viitorii juniori si speram si seniori
6430761 dupa 1990 cand majoritatea echipelor de oina s au dizolvat cererea de mingi de oina a scazut astfel incat timp de peste 15 ani s a jucat cu rezervele de mingi care erau pe stoc ultima comanda de mingi de oina a fost luata in 1991 de fabrica de articole din piele din sebes si nimeni nu s a interesat pentru ca nu a fost nevoie acum trei ani au inceput sa se termine mingiile si nimeni nu mai stia de unde se pot lua cum se pot face m am gandit ca e o treaba cat se poate de serioasa lipsa mingilor cu atat mai mult cu cat mingea de oina este si un obiect traditional romanesc
6430762 fiecare popor care are un joc asemanator cu oina are si o minge a sa proprie pe care o foloseste poate ca mingiile sunt asemanatoare intre ele insa tine de mandria fiecaruia de a juca cu propria minge mingea de oina este facuta din 8 petice din piele care se cos manual pe interior cu ajutorul unui scaun de pielarie cand mingea este aproape gata se intoarce pe dos si se umple cu par de porc dupa care se inchide

6430764 din cauza ca se lucreaza foarte greu cu el si miroase ingrozitor nu exista o metoda stiintifica de a evalua calitatea mingilor in functie de continutul lor eu ca proba am umplut mingi cu par de caine cu par de femeie cu par de cal pentru mine este un hobby
6430765 la inceput mingea avea diametrul de 9 centimetri si era destul de voluminoasa nu prea se putea tine sau arunca si atunci federatia a decis sa le micsoreze diametrul cu un centimetru au trimis solicitarea fabricii numai ca nu si au dat seama ca mingea de 9 centimetri avea greutatea de 180 de grame care a fost stabilita in mod empiric cand s a trecut la dimensiunea redusa nu s a mai transmis greutatea la fabrica si cand cei de acolo au vazut ca baga lana in minge si ea iese la 120 130 de grame le a venit ideea sa bage si nisip dezavantajul noilor mingi era ca daca te loveau te puteau rani si ca fiind batute in mod repetat se descentrau pentru ca nisipul are tendinta de a se muta dintr o parte in alta si pasele isi pierdeau precizia asa ca cei care le cumparau le desfaceau le goleau le umpleau cu lana fara sa mai tina cont de greutate si jucau cu ele
6430766 am trimis la jocurile olimpice la casa romaniei de la beijing bastoane mingi postere cu jocul de oina materiale video pentru ca este cel mai important eveniment sportiv international olimpiada este locul in care fiecare tara isi promoveaza rezultatele sportive valorile si este o ocazie ideala sa ne prezentam jocul nostru traditional pana la urma toate jocurile actuale internationale au pornit de la niste jocuri locale care au prins la public sau au fost preluate si de alte comunitati cred ca este datoria noastra sa facem si oina cunoscuta cine stie poate vor fi si altii care vor dori sa o incerce

6430770 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6430771 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6430772 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

6430815 ive talked to a software vendor who manufactures geology mapping software for oil drilling and every version of their software has been cracked and pirated
6430816 it could be a lead to a var value added reseller who could go in and say its great youre using this software but you need to pay up

6430818 they only want to do as much work as they need to meanwhile our technology lies dormant during that initial crack cycle
6430819 all the pirates have to do is identify the port or the gateway server and put a firewall rule or a network filtering rule to block that communication
6430820 once they find out the intelligence tool is preventing them from getting pirated revenue then the pirates will do something about it

6430867 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6430868 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6430869 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming

6430945 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6430946 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6430947 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6430948 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6430949 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6430950 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6430951 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6430952 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6430953 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6430954 we are making progress together in the defeat of iraqs enemies of all stripes

6430957 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6430958 and as we said from the begininng there is no hidden agenda here

6430994 in relationships the frequency of sexual intercourse that takes place on a couples common initiative and on mutual agreement is decreasing the pursuit of spontaneity leads to an apparent decline in frequency

6430996 i dont know how poets in other parts of the country have anything to write about we seem to have such a monopoly on the bizarre the pathetic and the passionately contradictory
6430997 were going to have to cut more or were going to have to tighten our belts even more so tougher decisions are going to have to be made
6430998 there has to be some give somewhere in order to do that and thats an ongoing conversation
6430999 ive never worked for a government or public entity that explicitly put money for raises in the budget
6431000 that would certainly be my fantasy i dont know that that is going to happen
6431001 thats what we would like to see happen now we have to work with the pft and the other unions to see if we can make that happen
6431002 we want to do a financial plan that strategically looks over five years and includes costs for raises but that cant happen unless we look at some of this give and take

6431019 some of the issues that come up is gee this is different than what i thought it was going to be and that causes stress
6431020 the best thing is to be aware of a different approach to time management and stress management the balance points of work and play are different than in high school you may have to study a lot more but that doesnt mean you have to sacrifice all of play
6431021 the planning for a whole semester worth of work rather than just a week at a time is the biggest switch

6431038 han sido rechazadas en el parlamento por el psoe y el prc
6431039 hay ejemplos de sobra ya que en el debate sobre el estado de la regi n no aprobaron ni una sola de todas nuestras propuestas sobre medio ambiente y estamos esperando a que explique a los ciudadanos todos los incumplimientos que caracterizan la gesti n del consejero
6431040 invirtiendo su tiempo y sus recursos financieros en estas cuestiones y aclarando otras en las que cada d a manifiesta una postura diferente estaremos en disposici n de apoyar sus ideas y proyectos siempre que beneficien el desarrollo sostenible

6431050 you dont want it to end this way but its all we could do
6431051 the fact is i played on one leg for two years
6431052 you hear people say that you slowed down that you dont have it anymore but you know that you still have it all the naysayers who are saying that i lost a step theyll get a full dosage of me next year
6431053 this is a chance for jermaine to really make a statement
6431054 he is extremely motivated right now to answer any questions about his health his attitude and who he is as a basketball player i cant think of a better mental or emotional state to find a player in
6431055 i couldnt have dreamed in my worst nightmare that i wouldnt have won a championship by now and that the team we had would go into the dumps
6431056 i had the best conversation ive had with larry in five years
6431057 it was really civil really logical i dont think that we hated each other i just think so much had happened that it made the job difficult and the only way for that team to move forward was to move me
6431058 but he was at the point where he thought a change of scenery would help him
6431059 we boxed up all of my stuff and the clothes i didnt want we took to the salvation army
6431060 still he kept with it we didnt touch a basketball for the first month but he was here to work every day
6431061 because he has type a blood he stays away from red meat
6431062 no potatoes no tomatoes but he can have rice egg whites soybeans and broccoli
6431063 im not brought in to be the new face of the team im brought in to take the team to the next level
6431064 its chriss team and im not coming in to step on his feet or coach sam mitchell s feet but im not just trying to fit in either im trying to be dominant
6431065 we had been discussing a viral campaign for three or four months now placing some stuff on the net so some of this was just wacky timing
6431066 the whole concept behind our campaign was that we wanted people to be looking at our web site while they were thinking they were looking at someone elses
6431067 and when i think about how it might affect fall out boy all i can say is that petes a clever bloke and he probably wouldve done the same thing had he thought of it
6431068 i mean think about it the two campaigns are very similar theirs is supposed to look like an ominous organization thats mucking around the way the two campaigns crossed didnt hurt anyone
6431069 the whole idea was mocking other sites and if life went according to plan you wouldve seen that continue instead it got ripped to shreds overnight
6431070 but like i said this wasnt done maliciously and everything ive heard about pete is that hes a marketing kind of guy hes the king of making people talk and ruffling feathers so he wouldve done the same thing if he could have so if fall out boy fans are mad about this whole thing well all i can say is that pete wouldve done the same thing
6431071 i could see it screwed up the africans out there i was at home as they were all getting cold i live and train in victoria so im good i train in that all year

6431082 the bonfire has been stacked for some time but arizona sen john mccain tossed in a match last week when he said the 86 year old law that governs use of the colorado river obviously should be renegotiated the presumptive republican presidential nominee clarified his statement wednesday saying it may have been mistakenly construed as a call to rescind the colorado compact when all he wanted was a more measured approach which nevertheless could mean less water for utah all seven compact states utah colorado wyoming new mexico arizona nevada and california signed an interim agreement in december to share the pain of colorado river water shortages and agreed to ensure that the levels of lake powell and lake mead are equal but more than 20 scientific studies conducted during the past four years show the colorado is unlikely anytime soon to be at the high level it was in 1922 when the compact was signed
6431083 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis such as the elderly pregnant women and those with weak immune systems to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6431084 i have also asked all public health units to advise emergency rooms in their jurisdictions to be on alert for cases

6431098 instranet gets customers up and running very quickly and we are very big on getting customers up and running quickly rather than putting them through some two year slog

6431115 it doesnt matter if they were or werent involved in an attack today yesterday or on sept 11 2001 we seek out terrorists and we will give them the option to be captured or killed or possibly flee
6431116 everyone knows that terrorism is particularly fed by what is happening in afghanistan
6431117 we have no information allowing us to consider that french soldiers were killed under fire of nato planes
6431118 particularly in dealing with the insurgents who are coming across the border from pakistan into afghanistan

6431130 misha saakashvili is to blame for this he started the war and he has to go
6431131 no one used to say that this person is russian or that person a georgian
6431132 russians are good and kind people we have the same religion and the russian soldiers here are behaving very well theres only one person who is guilty and he is in moscow you know who that is
6431133 there is no leadership here in the town everything was fine here before and i just dont know whats happened here of course ordinary people arent to blame

6431135 we are brotherly nations but america is stopping us living together it has its own interests
6431136 at first the russian troops came in then the ossetians people werent killed by the soldiers but a lot of people died in the bombing

6431145 this is worldwide this guy is changing the face of the sport and hes doing it in such a humble fashion as well
6431146 i mean he couldnt have scripted it any better to win by a hundredth of a second on some of his races have amazing relay swims to win eight golds is an unbelievable achievement
6431147 i think people took the mickey out of him in school for having big ears hes certainly a lot thinner than i am i mean i must be 50 pounds heavier than he is you know

6431193 access to such a large and diverse body of work will give them the opportunity to scale up their ideas and really test them to see if they can make something that will change the way life scientists read write visualize even think about data
6431194 there are no regrets to many of the actions we can take now
6431195 we are talking about improving river management and restoring the flood holding and drought proofing services of flood plains and wetlands all of which can be shown to have short term economic social and environmental pay offs
6431196 the fact that they help climate proof our river basins now is an added benefit
6431197 setting biofuel targets without considering where the water to grow biomass crops will come from is a recipe for a worsening water crisis in many regions and freshwater systems less able to cope with extreme weather events
6431198 more dams for hydropower is a recipe for even more fragmented rivers that will inhibit freshwater species the food for millions adapting to climate impacts by migrating up or down river systems
6431199 restoration of the 37 sites that make up the lower danube green corridor is estimated to cost 183 million compared to damages of 396 million from the 2005 flood and likely earnings of 85 6 million per year
6431200 this is adaptation to climate impacts even if it is not planned or labeled as adaptation
6431201 this is adaptation that involves and respects the needs of local communities and people and provides immediate benefits mr pittock said
6431202 our studies show that it is often a disaster that leads to the river restoration activities that will increase resilience to climate impacts
6431203 it would make more sense to avoid or reduce the impact of disaster by restoring and strengthening our river systems now
6431204 uncertainty is no reason for not acting on climate change impacts on vital water systems we are certain there will be significant impacts even if we cant put as many decimal points on them as we would like to
6431205 gvp is a very important element of our overall strategy
6431206 because it brings to the forefront the convergence of all the technologies that touch customer service along with our cim platform gvp has led the transformation away from silos and point solutions towards a more holistic approach to customer care
6431207 in the present down economy were not seeing companies abandon customer service to focus on cost containment instead were seeing companies invest in technologies that help to lower costs but also improve customer service and personalization either in self assistance live assistance or both
6431208 were seeing an increased investment in newer generation software based ivrs that integrate much more tightly to both customer data in crm software packages as well as to real time contact queuing and routing engines
6431209 genesys has succeeded in combining its scale assets and partnerships to create and amplify the value of its gvp 8 platform
6431210 gvp 8 is an integrated software layer that leverages the large investment and focus enterprises have put into crm the web and business rules engines over the past several years whats interesting is that genesys is leading with innovative applications and partnerships in its release of gvp 8 rather than the usual vendor messaging around new features and functions
6431211 todays customer focused enterprises look for technology platform providers who work well with partners and support rapid deployment in multi vendor environments
6431212 genesys successfully knit together the partner friendly attributes of two leading voice platforms and attracted an
6431213 oil gas and water are huge problems because of the bubbles and the interface between phases and they require a lot of computational power to solve them
6431214 we selected the sgi altix ice because we are working on developing new models to solve those fluid flow problems faster computations and simulations we used to do in two weeks we now expect will take one or two days because of the power of the sgi system this work will benefit not only petrobras everyone who uses simulation for complex multiphase flows will be impacted by our expanded software development
6431215 the models developed through sgi altix ice powered research at the federal university of santa catarina could very well lead to what the world needs now expanded and more efficient energy production
6431216 the wide array of real life problems of multiphase flow has made it extremely difficult to develop equations which describe realistic multiphase flows but as processing on powerful sgi systems becomes more prevalent dissecting various features of the flow will increase understanding of the necessary features to consider in a model
6431217 optimized hpc infrastructure for cfd and related multidisciplinary simulations of engineering systems
6431218 to our knowledge this is the first instance in which microcontact printing has been used to fabricate and position microbattery electrodes and the first use of virus based assembly in such a process
6431219 does not involve any expensive equipment and is done at room temperature
6431220 then we turn the stamp over and transfer the electrolyte and anode to a platinum structure
6431221 were also interested in integrating the batteries with biological organisms
6431222 isis is a perfect example of how a person can transform their life when offered support opportunity and coaching
6431223 it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be im not much of a small talker and i dont think she is either i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years
6431224 everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
6431225 i think it will be ok were both grown women both professionals once we were working it felt like a good fit
6431226 everybody was on pins and needles and sort of waiting to see how theyd react they started off kind of tentative but by the time we were five takes in they were giggling and seemed to be reconnecting
6431227 i know shannen probably doesnt share the feelings that i have for tori but i love tori like my sister
6431228 i hope it turns out to be a really great show just for my dads legacy i was originally a part of 90210 and it was something pretty phenomenal so i hope it turns out great
6431229 thats the wonderful free enterprise system anyone in the barnyard can earn as much as he wants but under our modern government regulations productive workers must divide their products with the idle
6431230 personal beliefs and values and cultural and religious practices are central to the lives of physicians and their patients however as a physicians responsibility is to place the needs of the patient first there will be times when it may be necessary for physicians to set aside their personal beliefs in order to ensure that patients or potential patients are provided with the medical treatment and services they require physicians should be aware that decisions to restrict medical services offered to accept individuals as patients or to end physician patient relationships that are based on moral or religious belief may contravene the code and or constitute professional misconduct
6431231 the college is unable to advise physicians how the courts will decide cases
6431232 man has the right to act in conscience and in freedom so as personally to make moral decisions he must not be forced to act contrary to his conscience nor must he be prevented from acting according to his conscience especially in religious matters
6431233 actors see me differently now they think im taken more seriously now the perception is that theater people are taken seriously
6431234 after the concert joel thought shed respect the fact that he was trying to be honest after all he and mary kate are just friends but nicole was hurt and angry he couldnt deal with it so he hung up and she kept texting him after that
6431235 theyre having their usual ups and downs i think theyre madly in love and want to get married but i also think its moments like this that will continue to keep their wedding on hold
6431236 were not here to attack catholics christians have always defended the innocent whether they have been born yet or not
6431237 it is true that both my opponent and i should work to reduce the number of abortions
6431238 i believe we can do that by providing good prenatal care and prevention we need to prevent unintended pregnancies that lead to abortion
6431239 we have been able to prevent abortions through limiting unintended pregnancies
6431240 my opponent has done nothing to prevent the number of abortions
6431241 fully informed regarding the pain experienced by their unborn child
6431242 there are no miracles in football you have to start to organise youth competitions before you can succeed at a higher level
6431243 where football is developed at youth level you have a good national team
6431244 they should start again with the young players and not artificially try to bring in the best from somewhere for the national team and to change them every year
6431245 there must be some continuity there must be a plan of course the people will not be happy when they see the mens team go out in the first round
6431246 i know john mccain i know his love of country he will choose the best person and if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6431247 its been a great day i dont think i deserve to be in this position in the past two months this is only my fourth round of golf ive got 11 stitches on my neck and thankfully the cyst was benign
6431248 wow not bad i feel i dont deserve the round but ill take it
6431249 you know when i was diagnosed with spinal meningitis in 2004 the doctor said i may not be able to play golf again and that i could die or even suffer a memory loss after the surgery so im just happy to be out here playing
6431250 ive played well in brunei for the past three years but have always finished poorly in the weekend ill try to push for a first win but because of my heart problem i tend to get tired very quickly the doctors have said i cant do anything about my health so ive got to live with it
6431251 its great to come out and defend my gold medal
6431252 its been great to see jamaica get a clean sweep of the sprints now i have to concentrate on the relays
6431253 but i just have to remember the verse in the bible which says give thanks in every circumstance
6431254 the start was bad and the end wasnt that great either but im grateful for the silver
6431255 bolt started it off and jamaicas sprinters have just kept it going
6431256 we have a great tradition of sprinters and we wanted to show what we could do here
6431257 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6431258 directed the authorities to make efforts to expose the hidden hands behind the incident
6431259 our bombers carried out todays attack it is in reaction to military operations in swat and bajaur
6431260 similar attacks will be carried out in other cities of pakistan including lahore islamabad and rawalpindi
6431261 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge
6431262 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside
6431263 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded
6431264 sometimes people get their hopes up about salaries when they get out of school
6431265 if you dont have the background for investment banking you dont want to be disappointed when goldman sachs wont touch you after graduation
6431266 expect a 35 percent increase from their pre mba salary to 76 000 from 56 000
6431267 a salary premium of 28 percent more than graduates from other graduate programs and 71 percent more than new hires from undergraduate programs
6431268 if you look at the last decade theres been an incredible growth of these programs
6431269 show this card at any participating orlando area exxon station to get your free save the tiger poster
6431270 if you look at the numbers the average us household belongs to 12 different loyalty programs but they only use about a third of them
6431271 that means that there is just so much money being invested into these loyalty programs that just sort of fall out of the wallet or end up in the sock drawer to never be used again
6431272 if i make an investment in this program at the end of the day is it going to make me more money
6431273 people dont tend to forget to carry around their credit card but theyll leave most of those 12 loyalty cards at home
6431274 how about combining the two and making it easier for consumers
6431275 the interest that weve seen from the credit card companies they are all very interested in this
6431276 so we know were on to something here and i think theyre looking at us and saying wow this is really the next evolution for consumers
6431277 what were seeing is really more of a trend of hey i usually go to three or four coffee shops if i consolidate my business then maybe ill get a free cup of coffee a week and that really adds up a couple dollars a week especially in this economy is important
6431278 i noticed there were three negatives from the dedication that were taken close together
6431279 that struck me as odd because of the difficulty and cost of taking pictures back then i also noticed the camera was not pointed at the stand but more toward the right i zoomed in and that was when i saw this figure
6431280 why would secretary of war stanton have allowed a photographer to make this intrusive shot when he confiscated the picture of lincoln all dressed up and lying in state in ny city hall
6431281 unlikely as it would be just way out of fashion by 1865 and too hard to take in a room with no lighting
6431282 it seems to me they are one and the same shot with the alleged deathbed photo lloyd ostendorf and charles hamilton published as a spurious image in their 1963
6431283 i noticed there were three negatives from the dedication that were taken close together
6431284 that struck me as odd because of the difficulty and cost of taking pictures back then i also noticed the camera was not pointed at the stand but more toward the right i zoomed in and that was when i saw this figure

6431290 the dangling person probably feels cervical pain and suffers from an acute headache as a result of the rope closing off the veins of the neck it had been generally assumed that fracture dislocation of the neck causes instantaneous loss of sensation sensory pathways from below the neck are ruptured but the sensory signals from the skin above the noose and from the trigeminal nerve may continue to reach the brain until hypoxia blocks them
6431291 despite the thousands of horses killed or wounded in battle the highest number were lost to disease or exhaustion the tenth massachusetts battery lost 157 horses between october 18 1862 and april 9 1865 out of these horses 112 died from disease forty five of these succumbed to glanders glanders a highly contagious disease that affects the skin nasal passages and respiratory tracts of a horse was most widespread another forty five horses from the same battery were lost to fatigue they simply became too exhausted to work and were put to death
6431292 approximately 500 soldiers north and south combined were executed for capital crimes the union armys records show that they executed 267 men this included 147 deserters 67 murderers 19 mutineers 23 rapists and 11 others for various crimes
6431293 i once saved lincolns life we had been going to school together one year but the next year we had no school because there were so few scholars to attend there being only about 20 in the school the year before consequently abe and i had not much to do but as we did not go to school and our mothers were strict with us we did not get to see each other very often one sunday morning my mother waked me up early saying she was going to see mrs lincoln and that i could go along glad of the chance i was soon dressed and ready to go after my mother and i got there abe and i played all through the day while we were wandering up and down the little stream called knob creek abe said right up there pointing to the east we saw a covey of partridges yesterday lets go over and get some of them the stream was swollen and was too wide for us to jump across finally we saw a narrow foot log and we concluded to try it it was narrow but abe said lets coon it i went first and reached the other side all right abe went about half way across when he got scared and began trembling i hollered to him dont look down nor up nor sideways but look right at me and hold on tight but he fell off into the creek and as the water was about seven or eight feet deep and i could not swim and neither could abe i knew it would do no good for me to go in after him so i got a stick a long water sprout and held it out to him he came up grabbed wi th bo th hands and i put the stick into his hands he clung to it and i pulled him out on the bank almost dead i got him by the arms and shook him well and then rolled him on the ground when the water poured out of his mou he was all right very soon we promised each other that we would never tell anybody about it and never did for years i never told any one of it until after lincoln was killed
6431294 last night about eleven oclock i went to the soldiers home alone riding old abe as you call him a horse he delighted in riding and when i arrived at the foot of the hill on the road leading to the entrance to the home grounds i was jogging along at a slow gait immersed in deep thought contemplating what was next to happen in the unsettled state of affairs when suddenly i was aroused i may say the arousement lifted me out of my saddle as well as out of my wits by the report of a rifle and seemingly the gunner was not fifty yards from where my contemplations ended and my accelerated transit began my erratic namesake wi th little warning gave proof of decided dissatisfaction at the racket and wi th one reckless bound he unceremoniously separated me from my eight dollar plug hat wi th which i parted company without any assent express or implied upon my part at a break neck speed we soon arrived in a haven of safety meanwhile i was left in doubt whether dea th was more desirable from being thrown from a runaway federal horse or as the tragic result of a rifle ball fired by a disloyal bushwhacker in the middle of the night
6431295 in the face of this testimony in favor of your theory of danger to me personally i cant bring myself to believe that any one has shot or will deliberately shoot at me with the purpose of killing me although i must acknowledge that i heard this fellows bullet whistle at an uncomfortably short distance from these headquarters of mine i have about concluded that the shot was the result of accident it may be that some one on his return from a days hunt regardless of the course of his discharge fired off his gun as a precautionary measure of safety to his family after reaching his house
6431296 i tell you there is no time on record equal to that made by the two old abes on that occasion the historic ride of john gilpin and henry wilsons memorable display of bareback equestrianship on the stray army mule from the scenes of the battle of bull run a year ago are nothing in comparison to mine either in point of time made or in ludicrous pageantry
6431297 somebody had fired a gun off at the foot of the hill
6431298 from that day on lincoln rode to and from the soldiers home in a carriage surrounded by soldiers

6431300 singularly enough the one european country which showed a definite friendship for the northern government was czarist russia in the fall of 1863 two russian fleets entered american waters one in the atlantic and one in the pacific they put into new york and san francisco harbors and spent the winter there and the average northerner expressed both surprise and delight over the visit assuming the russian czar was taking this means of warning england and france that if they made war in support of the south he would help the north since pure altruism is seldom or never visible in any countrys foreign relations the business was not quite that simple russia at the time was in some danger of getting into a war with england and france for reasons totally unconnected with the civil war in america to avoid the risk of having his fleets icebound in russia ports the czar simply had them winter in american harbors if war should come they would be admirably placed to raid british and french commerce for many years most americans believed that for some inexplicable reason of his own the czar had sent the fleets simply to show his friendship for america
6431301 in a contest over the mississippi river an inept union general almost committed on of the costliest mistakes of the war then an equally incompetent confederate general beat him to it from the outset of the war the sprawling state of kentucky had declared its neutrality presidents lincoln and davis both vowed to respect the wishes of their mutual birthplace although beneficial to both men neutral bluegrass was as good as gold for davis resting on five hundred miles of the confederacys border from western virginia across the length of tennessees vulnerable north boundary kentucky stood directly between the southern heartland and five union states the only land avenues left into dixie were tumultuous missouri and the stone wall of virginia all this mattered little to self aggrandizing union gen john c fremont and equally shortsighted confederate gen leonidas polk both eyed kentuckys jagged westerly tail as prime unclaimed real estate for controlling the mighty mississippi as it turned out both generals targeted columbus kentucky a small undefended town tucked neatly in a strategically exquisite bend in the river consulting neither their presidents nor their war departments each man positioned himself for the first strike polk in union city tennessee and fremont across the waters in belmont missouri polk was the first to move he crossed the tennessee kentucky border on september 3 1861 and snuggled into columbus the following day hearing of polks unilateral act of political idiocy tennessee gov isham harris confederate secretary of war leroy walker and jefferson davis demanded that polk withdraw back to tennessee an indignant polk took the orders under advisement and declined repercussions were swift armed with the moral high ground union forces took two days to occupy paduch in the west and frankfort in the north in two weeks the government of kentucky declared allegiance to the union a vast roadblock to the confederacy had become an open passage

6431314 if theyre eating something thats glowing in the dark bio luminescent prey then the darkness on the inside of the mantle shields the light from going outside and exposing the squid to a predator such as a sperm whale
6431315 but we know they are not eating fish with light organs but juvenile colossal squid do have two little light organs under their eyes it looks like she is brooding many many thousands of tiny colossal squid inside her mantle and the darkness will shield the light
6431316 my research suggests theyre not the t rex of the sea they get more docile as they mature a strange phenomenon that has caught scientists off guard
6431317 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine its likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs living on dead fish while her mate was off hunting

6431322 it has been a very painful day for the fatal accident and i want to send my condolences to all the families of the victims
6431323 we started slowly you need to be consistent in the first half we could have been trailing
6431324 it was great to be back though not so nice to start out down 2 0
6431325 im happy with this result because we created many chances and my players looked for the win up to the final whistle
6431326 the czech counterattack was very dangerous and we need to work on that
6431327 i learned things that when the other team counterattack we have problems
6431328 we are just starting the season and some players are not at the top physically and im sure in the next game we will be better
6431329 im very happy and especially excited by the portuguese display
6431330 we moved the ball around well and we managed to create a lot of chances were ready for the next phase of work
6431331 so early in the season with a fairly new line up we played quite well
6431332 we tried to play at high pace we passed well the second goal was well created

6431343 it bothers me whats going on behind the scenes here because certainly we arent receiving any bids

6431377 the exterior is how you recognize the vehicle but your interior is how you live with your car
6431378 anything you have to live with you have to have a level of comfort attraction functionality and durability
6431379 it doesnt matter if they were or werent involved in an attack today yesterday or on sept 11 2001 we seek out terrorists and we will give them the option to be captured or killed or possibly flee
6431380 everyone knows that terrorism is particularly fed by what is happening in afghanistan
6431381 we have no information allowing us to consider that french soldiers were killed under fire of nato planes
6431382 particularly in dealing with the insurgents who are coming across the border from pakistan into afghanistan

6431388 if you look at the last decade theres been an incredible growth of these programs
6431389 show this card at any participating orlando area exxon station to get your free save the tiger poster
6431390 if you look at the numbers the average us household belongs to 12 different loyalty programs but they only use about a third of them
6431391 that means that there is just so much money being invested into these loyalty programs that just sort of fall out of the wallet or end up in the sock drawer to never be used again
6431392 if i make an investment in this program at the end of the day is it going to make me more money
6431393 people dont tend to forget to carry around their credit card but theyll leave most of those 12 loyalty cards at home
6431394 how about combining the two and making it easier for consumers
6431395 the interest that weve seen from the credit card companies they are all very interested in this
6431396 so we know were on to something here and i think theyre looking at us and saying wow this is really the next evolution for consumers
6431397 what were seeing is really more of a trend of hey i usually go to three or four coffee shops if i consolidate my business then maybe ill get a free cup of coffee a week and that really adds up a couple dollars a week especially in this economy is important
6431398 our team led by our seniors has such a positive outlook for the season and we will be striving for excellence from the beginning
6431399 seguimos en contacto con las autoridades espa olas en particular el ministerio de exteriores para determinar si otros franceses pod an haber estado en el avi n
6431400 he stepped in a hole while chasing a fly ball for las vegas at fresno last night and left the game with discomfort in his knee he isnt playing tonight at colorado springs but he is expected to return to the lineup tomorrow joe torre made sure to point out that jones was scheduled to sit tonight anyway even before stepping in the hole
6431401 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6431402 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6431403 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6431404 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6431405 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6431406 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6431407 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6431408 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6431409 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6431410 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6431411 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6431412 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6431413 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6431414 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6431415 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6431416 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6431417 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6431418 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6431419 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6431420 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6431421 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6431422 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6431423 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6431424 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6431425 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6431426 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6431427 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6431428 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6431429 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6431430 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6431431 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6431432 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6431433 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6431434 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6431435 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6431436 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6431437 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6431438 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6431439 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6431440 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6431441 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6431442 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6431443 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6431444 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6431445 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6431446 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6431447 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6431448 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6431449 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6431450 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6431451 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6431452 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6431453 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6431454 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6431455 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6431456 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6431457 does this mean mccain edges obama in the passion poll too
6431458 he was once a pow and that trumps everything you probably didnt know that because he never mentions it
6431459 its interesting that you edge toward an objective analysis of mccains warmonger tendencies by referring to the welch piece but that reference only spotlights the broad willingness of the media to ignore what should be a major theme of any campaign for president
6431460 despite all that the clear difference for him is the level of clinton supporters who would apparently rather see another 4 years of george bush than give up a hissy fit hillary and bill had better rally these people in a serious way at the convention
6431461 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6431462 the internet is just a world passing around notes in a classroom
6431463 our goal in designing cruze was to be bold not evolutionary
6431464 we wanted to take a big step forward making a strong design statement for chevrolet products around the world
6431465 we are proud that europe is leading the introduction for this global product
6431466 chevrolet has always stood for expressive value and cruze delivers on that promise like never before it further redefines chevrolet with its design quality materials and great style inside and out the fit and finish for gaps and interfaces sets a new standard for this segment in europe and around the world
6431467 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6431468 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6431469 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6431470 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6431471 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6431472 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6431473 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6431474 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6431475 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6431476 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6431477 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6431478 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6431479 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6431480 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6431481 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

6431499 todo lo que estan argumentando es mentira este vuelo siempre tine problema
6431500 in april the federal aviation administration inspected american airline boeing md 80s and found a maintenance problem wiring bundles that had been improperly wrapped and attached inside wheel wells the airline canceled 3 300 flights
6431501 the wiring is required to be stowed in a way to avoid chafing by moving parts in the wheel well which otherwise could result in an electric short
6431502 la muerte est tan segura de alcanzarnos que siempre nos da una vida de ventaja
6431503 we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counterproductive
6431504 we urge the federal government to fully respect the well founded principles of conscientious objection
6431505 aparentemente dos hombres hicieron estallar los explosivos fuera de la f brica durante un cambio de turno
6431506 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6431507 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6431508 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6431509 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6431510 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6431511 i think the first half we thoroughly deserved to be ahead
6431512 i think we would have liked to have penetrated them a bit more but i think as far as playing in the game was concerned we were in control up until probably the 60th minute and then we kind of lost our way a wee bit
6431513 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6431514 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6431515 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6431516 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6431517 you cant criticise much of what liverpool teams of the past did when hansen was playing obviously they were the best team around but it was interesting to read him say that sometimes liverpool won the league even though they didnt have a particularly great side
6431518 he went on to say that there is no possible way you could do that today it struck a chord with me and i thought it was a fair point im not saying bad liverpool teams ever won the league of course they didnt but maybe a few years ago you could afford to carry a few players
6431519 i dont think thats possible now every position has got to be filled by a top player if you want to win things on a consistent basis look at the other top sides in the premier league even the full back positions are filled with the best full backs in the world now
6431520 years ago you could probably get away with carrying the odd player here or there it was good for me to hear that from someone who actually played back then rather than it coming from current players where itd probably just sound like an excuse
6431521 basically what hansen was saying was that its more difficult to win the league now than in his day the standards have been raised much higher over the past five to 10 years especially with the chelsea situation and whats happening there
6431522 well we tried our best but with the chelsea situation its almost impossible to win the league now
6431523 a lot of football success is in the mind you must believe you are the best and then make sure that you are
6431524 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6431525 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6431526 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6431527 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6431528 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6431529 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6431530 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6431531 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6431532 this is a planning took where all things are going
6431533 esto era lo que yo so aba de peque a ser una aut ntica princesa y estoy muy agradecida de todo lo que me est pasando ahora mismo
6431534 todos los personajes que he interpretado han sido distintos a bella todos han sido muy rockeros y de repente tengo que ser una princesa de disney
6431535 in recent weeks ricky martin became a proud father by the birth of twin sons
6431536 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6431537 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6431538 in my opinion this is perfect timing as we are fresh off of our ragbrai success and the logistics planning required for that will be helpful with this project
6431539 hes anxious to play behind nash and play for terry porter a true point guard both are all star players he couldnt ask for more its like when steve came in behind jason kidd and kevin johnson

6431548 the strong collaboration between joes crab shack and crunchtime has provided great benefits to both companies
6431549 we are excited to partner with joes crab shack and we look forward to playing an important role in their continued growth amp success

6431554 it is a source of pride and satisfaction that spectorsoft continues to be recognized as a growing and formidable force not only in its market space but also by recognizable and highly regarded media organizations such as inc magazine
6431555 making the list the first time is quite an event but staying in the mix thereafter becomes an even greater feat one im pleased to say weve been able to accomplish
6431556 the inc 5 000 provides the most comprehensive look ever at the most important part of the economy the entrepreneurial part
6431557 the expansion of the list has allowed us to tell the stories of larger companies older companies and a wealth of companies in industries like manufacturing and construction that are under reported in the business media
6431558 our new office establishes a strategic placement for our facilities that allows us to maintain proximity to current and prospective clients in northern virginia and metropolitan washington dc while giving us the opportunity to offer our comprehensive portfolio of web design and internet marketing services to clients and prospects in rising business communities to the west such as manassas warrenton and fredericksburg among others
6431559 we are very excited about this quarters program and the opportunity to include vendors as part of the agenda

6431561 being local to minneapolis knowledge infusion is proud to support the twin cities chapter and play an active part in providing relevant and exciting content to leaders in the area
6431562 we hope that hr professionals and vendors will take advantage of this unique opportunity to network together
6431563 we are extremely disappointed with the decision made by myspace and fox interactive to delete our account
6431564 myspace was a great way for us to keep in touch with our pool playing friends and customers so the loss of franks myspace page is not an insignificant loss
6431565 the biggest and best aspect of bighand in my opinion is the ability to download dictation from a remote location
6431566 when i am away from the office for days in a row i can download my dictation to the office allowing my legal secretary to transcribe it for my review either via an email attachment to me or an electronic file on the desktop this allows our clients to have updates on their cases far more quickly than when i would return to the office with a tape
6431567 we are very excited about welcoming rusin to our growing north american legal client base similar to other bighand innovators rusin based on a rapid bighand digital dictation rollout has been able to immediately take advantage of streamlined workflows and increased user productivity
6431568 best legal office technology system 2004 from votes from over 14 000 lawyers and it managers across the legal sector at the lotie awards

6431573 our entire site is dedicated to building healthy and strong families we believe 529 accounts are one of the best tools available to american families for managing the incredible costs of educating their kids
6431574 this all began when we saw how much quality time families were spending playing fantasy sports together building a site focused on family play and awarding money for college expenses was an obvious next step
6431575 there will be no break in the sale of alcohol at all
6431576 these restrictions do not take place for 21 days and at this time a new supervisor with the required licence will take over
6431577 i do not want our customers to think that the pub is closing it is not
6431578 our larger surveillance installations often require wireless because burying cable is impractical or cost prohibitive qorvus was strongly recommended to us by another mainland cctv integrator and i have been really impressed with the cost savings ease of installation wireless range and amazing performance weve been able to offer our customers using the qorvus technology
6431579 when youve done as many large scale cctv installations as we have you really value things like long term reliability responsive real time technical support and especially the wireless bandwidth to handle all those video streams without drop outs qorvus gives us all of that and much more
6431580 weve been exceptionally pleased with keener technologies and qorvus systems performance as vendors and definitely look forward to a continued relationship at our existing ports and at our planned new service locations
6431581 we couldnt be happier with the fantastic professional job that keener technologies has been doing in bringing our industrial cctv and wireless networking technologies to the hawaiian islands we always enjoy new challenges and ive been delighted with the results especially given the hostile industrial marine environment we faced at the ports of honolulu and maui

6431604 hey i can still get down and throw down and im not about to retire
6431605 about five minutes into the show he whispered in my ear this would be great in las vegas he liked the show he laughed and he sang along and he enjoyed it and at the end he said it reminded him very much of the 60s when he went into broadway and he had gone to see nichols and may those are my two collective heroes and the reason i went into python this musical is of course lovingly ripped off from the movie monty python and the holy grail which was made in 1975 for about 400 000 on the musical that is less than the lawyers cost but to come to the stage it needed quite a bit of changing we did about 17 drafts over 4 years but it made its money back after six months on broadway it was the big winner in london and we have a touring company that is really doing well everywhere
6431606 i thought it was an extraordinary show and i thought it was so funny i had not laughed as hard at a broadway musical since the first time i saw noises off back in the 80s i described spamalot as the show that if you laugh too long you miss the next joke it just doesnt stop and that is why i wanted to do it i wasnt thinking about vegas and lo and behold they said we are opening up in vegas and they asked if i would be in it i thought what a dream when my wife and i were in new york i went to see every other show because i really wanted to see what else was out there i circled two roles and i said to my wife i have got to do these roles one was the lead in dirty rotten scoundrels which closed before i got a hold of it and the other was the king in spamalot so it is easy to hop over to the executive airport and go home in la in just 45 minutes this has been an extraordinary thing and ill be full time through the summer here in vegas but then i go back in september and film we are shooting family feud again ill also be doing a new nbc show and believe it or not theres even a new one too but i cant talk about that one yet so in some cases i will be leaving vegas at midnight flying back to shoot the next day and then flying back here to do the spamalot show again that same night these are the gravy years this is the time you do the things to give you greater freedom later in life so while the opportunities are there i am going to embrace them
6431607 much has been written that maybe las vegas is not the place for comedy and musical theater the people come here from the midwest and around the world and they want spectacle they want big exciting things and maybe the musical theater isnt right for vegas over a period of years we have learned from the press and so we said why not face the inevitable and lets end it so we looked for the perfect piece of material to put a final chapter of theater into las vegas
6431608 there is a reality to these hotels in vegas there is a certain amount of space and there are certain things you can do we said well if we could do spamalot in the grail theater where avenue q was we would be able to preserve our convention and meeting space instead of building a third theater i must confess that i am ashamed of myself that i did it because of the money and the planning the decision was taken to abbreviate the stay of q we wanted to bring to this city something that hasnt really been done before we believe that vegas is a rich and mature enough community to also exploit wit and this theater was built to be that place in this city where humor and wit prevail i said to eric the night i went to spamalot for the first time this is the easiest entertainment decision i have made in 40 years las vegas would understand it and they would love it we are committed to the show for as long as the public likes it
6431609 only a couple of songs went all for one which we needed because we had a costume change for all the girls to get ready for the spamalot number
6431610 i was very nervous about opening in london i wasnt sure which way they would jump
6431611 i dont think we have added more vegas elements to it just because we are in vegas i realized that we couldnt improve or change the show because its so big and gross and over the top already we can only stay true to what we already do well that is part of the charm of it i am sure our vegas audiences will laugh like theyve never laughed before i find for me that it is more fun to work on python that anything else i tried to do a live reunion here in 1988 and we got very close we got an offer dates a hotel and then michael palin at the last minute said no he didnt want to do it it is scary to go back into the world of silliness but its essential to keep challenging yourself now though i dont think it will ever happen and thats why spamalot is so alive and well and keeping python alive and well too
6431612 the material is wacky and absurd irreverent and politically incorrect which is how you would describe las vegas actually
6431613 this is the show i should have done twenty years ago this is the dream come true

6431618 i wanted to take it to the next level of fan interactivity and no other sport in the world lets you get this close it literally is being in the locker room this has all turned out better than i expected i love what i see it makes me feel real proud to have everybody coming up and congratulating me they love it it is totally unique this puts us 10 years ahead of anybody else were in vegas and we wanted to be part of what its all about so our new facilities match the citys glamour and excitement now it revolutionizes the sport it makes it more fan friendly 12 000 people this weekend in the neon garage area almost touch the drivers hands watch over their shoulders as they work on their cars and thats important because its what we set out to achieve
6431619 our new banking will increase the speed by about 18mph therell be above 200mph in places but the qualifying speed wile about 191mph we have safe walls so we hope no more danger but certainly a lot more entertaining for the fans the turning radius is a little more than any other track although there are pother tracks with bigger banking than atlanta and texas but there will be guys going through those turns going a complete lap without ever lifting their foot off the accelerator on the straight aways therell be getting above 200mph we have the worlds best drivers for our vegas racing weekend
6431620 were tickled to death its turned out more spectacular state of the art and ahead of every other track in the world its the most dazzling makeover anywhere and in time for our 10th anniversary the entire project we hd no idea it would be as nice as it is brutons vision has been totally manifested the fans now get something here unlike anything else in the world the race fan always comes first lets give the fan to get close to the heroes of the sport while they are going about their business the race fan is so close to the stars as they work live and in person a few feet away theyll be able to peer right into see jeff gordon dale earnhardt jr kyle busch going about their business itll take some getting used to by the teams with the fans literally looking over their shoulders while they are tightening the engine parts fans will be able to come into the garage and look down at the cars as a surgeons class would be able to look down at an operation they will be able to see jeff gordon come out and talk to his crew chief about what needs to be done to the race car and watch the race team work on the race car it is going to bring a whole new element to las vegas we will have created the most wonderful sports facility center anywhere and well do it in the greatest city anywhere
6431621 speeds will increase but were actually looking for the increased competition
6431622 when the drivers are happy the fans are unhappy when the drivers are unhappy the fans are having a great time and theyre sure going to have a better time in las vegas from now on
6431623 we have tremendous sight lines at las vegas motor speedway wonderful backdrop mountains on the eastside of lv and off in the distance the las vegas strip you have the fan from small town usa that comes here to watch nascar and returns to the strip to downtown and gets to enjoy all that las vegas has to offer whether it is a show the gaming or the great restaurants that we have it has got to be the number one attraction in all motor sports to come to las vegas for nascar weekend there is no better place no other city to get this

6431757 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6431758 this agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6431759 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6431760 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6431761 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible
6431762 thailand is not allowing him to enter the country and hong kong is turning him back so there is no choice for him now said thai police col worawat amornwiwat
6431763 it is the responsibility of thai airways to take him out of the country and return him to england
6431764 what were hearing from trainers and physicians is were getting some back injuries when the ball carrier is immediately snapped to the ground by being jerked quickly
6431765 if the ball carrier is grabbed by the shoulder or jersey and just ridden to the ground over a couple of yards thats not going to be a foul
6431766 well err on the side of safety well defend the official who may be a little more strict because thats a major point of emphasis
6431767 this is a short dvd that focuses on proper injury prevention tackling techniques
6431768 its been distributed to every college in the nation and we encourage every football program to show this to the student athletes
6431769 he did well at right tackle and then we put him in at guard and he actually did better at guard
6431770 hes kind of a big body guy who just seems to bend just right and when people run into him they dont tend to get very far
6431771 the guy has a chance to be a pretty good starter for us
6431772 is a big loss for us he was a veteran on the offensive line
6431773 they really want me to use my quickness and strength on that side
6431774 so all of a sudden we started to see success you see the energy of what happens when you do start having success we have to overcome if some things arent going right its how you respond to it and thats what we do
6431775 the thing we had the other day is we had 10 people doing their job but the breakdown came from the fact that one guy didnt do his job so when one guy doesnt do his job theres going to be a breakdown it makes things dirty we dont know how to fit we dont know how to play things its about the 11 guys on the field doing whats right
6431776 weve made a move where weve moved ramon broadway up in front of jamar love
6431777 at the corner position isaac madison is playing pretty good he has his days where he has his ups and downs but hes been playing pretty consistently he has to improve on his tackling we need our corners to tackle and they have to be able to play both phases love was a situation where we felt he wasnt playing up to his expectations that we feel so we had to make that move
6431778 so its a matter of do you deal with the growing pains
6431779 how long do you do that before you feel comfortable possibly going back to that next guy if he showed us he wanted to be that type of football player a physical smart tough football player
6431780 its not like he means to do things wrong so hes just got to learn certain things where he needs to be and trust his speed knowing that if he keys and stops and runs at it the physical part is going to show up
6431781 its been a long process a long stressful process for me and my family
6431782 the whole system is about helping student athletes be successful and its good to see they are making that happen
6431783 we were getting ready to work a lot more hours developing a backup plan

6431790 the technology is moving a lot quicker than some people would expect
6431791 i never got to take my test because the company that was sponsoring me had some issues going on
6431792 one day i showed up to work and my boss was being handcuffed and put in a car they kind of locked down the place
6431793 i figured that was the end of my life insurance career
6431794 ive got good news and bad news the good news is you scored higher on the test than everybody the bad news is my dad wants to meet you and bring your playbook
6431795 i always enjoyed learning why we did the things we did offensively i always asked why sometimes the coaches maybe misunderstood me i wasnt really questioning them as much as i was just wanting to learn
6431796 i had told my wife awhile back that if mark gets a head job id like to go because i think great things could happen
6431797 if thats the only thing you can find thats wrong with him thats not bad
6431798 some people have to yell and scream to get their point across
6431799 some people have to exhibit certain animation mark knows who he is people respect him because of that hes the head coach but he doesnt have to tell anybody
6431800 i was kind of coaching off of past experiences and even fumes sometimes i didnt study the game on an ongoing basis like i normally do
6431801 which he did a very good job of but it got lost in the translation
6431802 i was listening i still wasnt seeing it in my mind quickly enough to make a change or make a call i would watch games afterward and id just think i cant believe we went the whole game and i didnt call this or do that id just be upset with myself
6431803 in the locker room at halftime if somethings not going right we need to get yelled at he definitely does that i think it just serves as an example for a lot of people that you can be passionate about something and yet stay calm and keep your head on your shoulders and stay levelheaded
6431804 we came out this afternoon and worked a lot on special teams
6431805 we got maybe 40 minutes work on special teams and then some situations coming out from the minus 1 how to end the game in what we call kill the clock offense and get the ball back on defense and then two minutes then we did some walk through stuff for our opener so it was a pretty short practice last two a day so im sure that the players are fired up about that
6431806 we got a lot of really good work on special teams
6431807 a lot of detail work and then hit some things that you have to spend time on that you dont really have time to do like sky kicks onside hands team all the things you have to have ready for that first game
6431808 weve been working jarius wright back there joe adams dennis johnson
6431809 weve really got four guys working in the secondary at the safety position
6431810 we are trying to make sure that we know both positions elton ford and matt harris have been working a lot at free safety and matt also runs over at strong safety dallas washington is there at strong safety and is doing a good job he knows what to do at the jack linebacker position that we have now and rashaad johnson plays both so its really a four man rotation and we feel that all four will play and as for who will start now i dont know but all four will rotate in and need to stay fresh
6431811 youve got to have guys that are not afraid to make mistakes
6431812 when you have guys that think about making mistakes all they do is make mistakes you need guys not worried about the what ifs
6431813 i wasnt satisfied i felt like i needed to make more plays to change the game when we needed a play on third down i just didnt get the job done i am just trying to get the job done this year and get off the field when someone else doesnt make it i need to make it
6431814 we feel we can be much stronger than we were a year ago
6431815 i like those situations where you have to come in and you being the guy everybodys looking forward to playing and helping out the defense thats what i want to do

6431819 there were 11 injured including natives and police officers in the clashes

6431823 there are doubts over the osces role during the initial stage of the conflict they were notified by the georgian side that there would be an invasion but did not warn russian peacekeepers
6431824 this fact makes us reconsider our relations it is an obligation of the osce to report on troop movements and they must answer for it

6432122 i think hes the greatest weightlifter of all time and i can say that without any resentment
6432123 in my estimation hes the greatest weightlifter and im talking worldwide
6432124 and living in a place like that you lose touch with civilization
6432125 the worst thing you can do in any sport is not have a coach
6432126 you need somebody to bawl you out and scream at you otherwise youll just repeat bad habits
6432127 i think hes the greatest weightlifter of all time and i can say that without any resentment
6432128 he was the greatest competitor because he always went where the competition was the toughest most lifters go where the chance of winning is the greatest at least thats what i did tommy would select the weight class that was the toughest
6432129 most athletes have an ideal body weight where they perform at their peak
6432130 maybe an athlete can move to a second weight class but for an athletes career to span four weight classes and have world records in all four there cant be more than one or two very remarkable people capable of accomplishing that type of feat

6432136 york that was a magical name to weightlifters around the world
6432137 being on the team was like playing baseball for the new york yankees once you were on that team you became a superstar
6432138 the one thing that has always struck me is what motivated lifters
6432139 i found that they often started out as weaklings one of the other dynamics that came into play was that most of the great weightlifters are foreign or ethnic non mainstream american
6432140 as i walked down the street kids were playing in an open lot and they stopped everything they were doing to look at me
6432141 i felt so ill at ease and these are only young kids it disturbed the heck out of me i swore i would never come back here again
6432142 away from the gym i was received differently because i looked different
6432143 id say it as more out of frustration than anything else but thats in the past now and im just looking forward to getting back into training for the final
6432144 i thrive on my sleep so when i got up this morning i knew that it was going to be a long day
6432145 but considering all that it was good i managed to shoot 67 with no bogeys which is great i just think that i managed my game well
6432146 i knew that my finish the seventh eighth and ninth was a really tough stretch and i almost accepted the fact that i would drop one there so to get out of it bogey free was a result
6432147 id much prefer to be four under but it got pretty tricky and we were unlucky to be on two of the most difficult holes at the time

6432173 neither myself nor fulham managing director alistair mackintosh have recently been contacted by any club regarding jimmy bullard
6432174 the only club i know that have made any contact at least with myself was wigan maybe five weeks ago
6432175 i find it strange that jimmy is being linked with moves in the press when no clubs are making offers for him

6432189 i thrive on my sleep so when i got up this morning i knew that it was going to be a long day
6432190 but considering all that it was good i managed to shoot 67 with no bogeys which is great i just think that i managed my game well
6432191 i knew that my finish the seventh eighth and ninth was a really tough stretch and i almost accepted the fact that i would drop one there so to get out of it bogey free was a result
6432192 id much prefer to be four under but it got pretty tricky and we were unlucky to be on two of the most difficult holes at the time

6432201 we were in trouble almost from the first minute of the second half and the goals we conceded were shocking defending there was indecision it was schoolboy stuff said toshack
6432202 you cannot make mistakes like that at this level you will be punished there was indecision people were arriving late at the situation and there was hesitancy i am concerned by a lot of things i saw
6432203 the centre of our defence gave us a lot of problems it is becoming a major problem we are lacking senior players in that area and it does not look like we are going to get our senior players danny gabbidon and james collins back for the first world cup qualifier
6432204 it was good to see fresh blood who can do a job we were unfortunate a couple of times not to score so it was just that lack of cutting edge that would have won us the game
6432205 we have been a bit unfortunate with injuries since i took over but there is nothing you can do about that and it gives people opportunities when we know who is going to be available that will give me a clearer mind about who is going to play
6432206 in every sport not only football results are important we said before the game that we had to believe in our quality norway believe in their quality and it was important for us to do the same the players believe in what we are doing and that is important for morale
6432207 the conditions in the second half completely ruined the game i think we would have kicked on because we were in control of the game the pitch absolutely spoiled the second half but we will take the positives from the first half said the liverpool striker
6432208 everything is falling into place for that to happen she said
6432209 it seems like someone has written this story just for us first we beat germany who beat us in the final of the world cup last year and now we find the united states blocking our path once more just as in the final in 2004 i firmly believe that it will be a different story this time around
6432210 im preparing to play my second consecutive final and ive already got one silver medal its wonderful im very happy but this time im hoping to end up with a gold medal round my neck
6432211 the last time we met brazil everything that could have gone wrong did
6432212 we know brazil have a ton of really talented attacking players but that was then and this is now
6432213 weve played them three times recently so maybe all the bad feelings weve had about the loss last year got worked out in those games
6432214 were not really thinking about last year were a different team and theyre a different team
6432215 its my greatest desire to return to brazil with a first womens trophy for my country
6432216 i believe that its our destiny to win the gold he said
6432217 both teams deserve to be in the final but i think we will be the ones who end up as the champions
6432218 we have only conceded three goals during this tournament and i think were getting better as a team with each game that we play for me our best performance was against belgium in the semi final and our second best performance was against c te divoire in the quarter finals but we want to be at our peak for the final match and i believe that we will be

6432226 i hope that this ruling serves as a lesson to all the talentless media obsessed no marks out there that the taxman does have a sense of humour declaring somebody with zero earning potential bankrupt is actually quite funny unless youre one of the people that was paying for her lifestyle

6432252 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6432253 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6432254 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6432255 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county

6432345 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6432346 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6432347 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6432348 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6432349 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6432350 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty

6432439 despite great expectations and promising results of clinical trials we still lack sufficient evidence of an effective vaccine against cervical cancer with so many essential questions still unanswered there is good reason to be cautious
6432440 some of our provinces are running out of money to provide primary care
6432441 im not against vaccines but in canada and the u s women are not dying in the streets of cervical cancer
6432442 giving the vaccine to 12 year olds would cost 43 600 for every quality adjusted year of life it saved by preventing a cancer death that price would often be considered acceptable by health officials in wealthy countries experts say

6432452 a priest is ordained with the privilege of celebrating the churchs sacraments by nothing less than a holy order

6432454 our clients are trying very hard to right the unrightable wrong
6432455 the civil process is not something that is amenable to righting this kind of wrong but theyre working very hard to try to come to a process where children in the future are protected
6432456 im glad to see this is settled but i feel sad though

6432463 the school did not merely find the confederate flag offensive to some students but rather found that in a context of high racial tensions race related altercations and threats of violence the flag would disrupt the schools educational process
6432464 we have all along felt it was in the best interest of our school environment to not allow any symbols that might be racially divisive in any way

6432485 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6432486 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6432487 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6432488 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6432489 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6432490 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in

6432497 id say it as more out of frustration than anything else but thats in the past now and im just looking forward to getting back into training for the final
6432498 i thrive on my sleep so when i got up this morning i knew that it was going to be a long day
6432499 but considering all that it was good i managed to shoot 67 with no bogeys which is great i just think that i managed my game well
6432500 i knew that my finish the seventh eighth and ninth was a really tough stretch and i almost accepted the fact that i would drop one there so to get out of it bogey free was a result
6432501 id much prefer to be four under but it got pretty tricky and we were unlucky to be on two of the most difficult holes at the time
6432502 its a good idea to encourage people to take some exercise i try and train two or three times a week
6432503 i try and do some running although as you can see clearly not enough
6432504 i also do some weights and i play tennnis and football when i can
6432505 i couldnt do this job unless i kept a certain level of physical fitness and as you go on in it becomes more and more important to keep yourself reasonably fit physically so you can be fit mentally
6432506 if you want to have a health care system thats capable of dealing with all the problems people have in the long term their physical fitness is a big part of it we have got a big opportunity with the olympics all of this whole place is going to be utterly transformed we are putting a lot of money into sport in schools now
6432507 what may be safe for many may be life threatening for a few
6432508 they should talk to their physicians about this for sure i think thats the most immediate advice talk about other alternatives or whether you need such a high dose or what to do
6432509 if you feel groggy and sedated you have to assume the baby is experiencing the same
6432510 i think now that this is out there we need to
6432511 neither myself nor fulham managing director alistair mackintosh have recently been contacted by any club regarding jimmy bullard

6432514 it bothers me whats going on behind the scenes here because certainly we arent receiving any bids
6432515 i really hope next week that everyone gets involved wherever they are

6432524 it means that coach reid has a lot of trust and respect in me to put me back in there because it wasnt even a big deal to me because i know max has worked hard this training camp and max is a good player
6432525 if max keeps working hard hes going to be a great player
6432526 i think its a good thing thats a positive thing
6432527 you want continuity there granted theyve played together a long time but they need to get in there and do it now and thats what they are going to do
6432528 we have enough of a gauge where we feel he can start the game there and well see how he does
6432529 we feel comfortable enough with that and well give him an opportunity to get in there and bang it a little bit and see what he can do

6432580 live big screen video using hand held cameras would be inadequate at 48p
6432581 is that why they all walk out on 60 hz hdtv oh wait they dont
6432582 i thought the audience walked out on the high film frame rate because it was too realistic now youre saying they cant tell the difference must have been an audience of supermen eh
6432583 the point where you cant tell the difference anymore is somewhere over 72 fps
6432584 personally i hate the jerky 24 fps film look id take 60 or 72 fps any day
6432585 flicker is noticed more with computer displays due to the white sheet of paper model flat white areas appear to flicker more than dark
6432586 another movie he directed brainstorm was originally designed to highlight a projection technology he was promoting the movie was about recording experiences in the film the recorded experiences were going to be played at 48 frames per second as opposed to the standard 24 frames per second his feeling was that audiences had gotten used to the look of standard film people were subliminally aware of the 24 frame per second flicker by projecting the film at twice the standard rate the flicker was harder to perceive and the film would be given that much more immediacy however it was impossible to convince the theater owners to install the special projectors to show the recorded experience sequences the movie was released as a conventional film fortunately the story stood up well on its own partly correct showscan runs at 60fps when he was doing test work for 2001 i believe it was on the spacewalk footage but its been years since i read up on the process and things have blurred for me he accidentally ran a sequence at 60fps and the uniform reaction in the booth was shock that hed gotten a 3d effect with a conventional camera he did dream up brainstorm to use the process but the studio hed been working with didnt want to install the only projector on the market that would run 60fps for an extended period without breaking for just one film and he ended up taking the story idea with him to mgm as i remember it he had to do a sizable payout to get it from his previous studio even then mgm wouldnt go for it compare and contrast with the ua chain which installed a highly sophisticated 3d system in a number of their theaters including seattle and ended up offering a couple of million dollars as a bounty to get someone anyone to shoot a feature using it there were several showscan shorts shot the one at expo 86 the one on magic tricks starring christopher lee and it looked like hed finally get them in widespread distribution when he signed a deal with a major restaurant chain to add a showscan theater to each of their restaurants but the chain was chuck e cheese and the deal was about two months before they imploded of all the reviews i read about the process the one that stuck with me was the one in cinefantastique that said makeup technology was going to have to improve greatly if the process was going to catch on you could apparently see every pore on christopher lees face

6432607 we feel our health benefits and sick leave benefits are competitive and we feel good about it
6432608 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
6432609 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
6432610 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality

6432618 only the tail was recognisable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6432619 its the closest thing to hell ive seen the corpses were boiling everything was burning there was nothing left that resembled a plane it was in pieces its a miracle anyone survived
6432620 i was on the runway and i could see the cloud of smoke the whole field erupted in flames over an area of about 1km square
6432621 the rescue workers couldnt get to the plane because of the fire engulfing the whole fuselage
6432622 this was a fairly elderly aircraft but saying that there are many of them flying
6432623 ive been trying phone them but they just dont answer i just dont know if they were on it
6432624 they were very dear friends and they would have put into effect immediately the full emergency evacuation system if they had been in a position to do so
6432625 we had just landed at barajas and were taxiing to terminal 4 when my wife pointed out a ball of flames at the end of the runway
6432626 at first i thought it was just landing but then i saw that it abruptly changed direction to the right and the wing seemed to hit the ground it seemed to break apart with a large explosion
6432627 i saw it take off and it climbed to about 200 metres when flames appeared in the engine it then crashed to the ground and disappeared from view in a hollow past the end of the runway
6432628 we extend deep condolences to the families and friends of those lost in the crash we stand ready to provide technical assistance

6432631 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6432632 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6432633 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6432634 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6432635 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6432636 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting

6432642 i have spoken to my national organization at the naacp and we will lend all the support we can to the federal lawsuit
6432643 i wish i could say more but we have been advised by our attorneys not to comment because there is a pending lawsuit
6432644 whats so difficult about all this is that i really liked the county commissioners
6432645 commissioners marseglia and cawley are not only members of the naacp but theyre active members

6432648 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6432649 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6432650 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6432651 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6432652 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in

6432670 we have been quite satisfied with the performance of the fieldturf installations at our practice facility and at our former home the rca dome
6432671 i know our players are happy that we will continue to play on fieldturf at our new home at lucas oil stadium
6432672 after playing a preseason game on fieldturf against the seattle seahawks in 2002 our players asked if we could put it in at our practice facility
6432673 after practicing on it we put it in at the rca dome weve had great experience with fieldturf and are excited that it will continue to be our playing surface in the new lucas oil stadium
6432674 the advance buzz throughout the sports industry is off the charts for lucas oil stadium and the fact that fieldturf will be the official playing surface at this fantastic facility is quite an accomplishment for our product we are extremely confident that we manufacture the absolute best playing surface in the world today but it feels great to get this type of affirmation from the colts of course fieldturfs latest selection by the colts tells us that owner jim irsay president bill polian and head coach tony dungy along with the players and team staff have been very pleased with the performance of our product during the past three years that they played and practiced on fieldturf now the colts will have the state of the art version of fieldturf to go along with their state of the art stadium

6432681 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows

6432687 so to me the decision when you put it in those terms is pretty easy
6432688 well i think youll find that if you do your research hundreds of athletes have done this i guess i am the first one to just draw attention to it
6432689 america has done it america has won many medals with athletes that are foreign born
6432690 its a dream that a little boy from kenya has dreamt about and finally came true and it didnt happen by myself
6432691 from the coach who sent me to the united states from the coach that i got from washington state and from the scholarship itself that came from the american taxpayers american money i am trying to give back to america what they gave me long before
6432692 if that trend develops yes i am sure the ioc would look at it
6432693 i think the rules are about right i think on balance we would want people to take part in the games rather than deny them the opportunity
6432694 if floodgates begin to open then clearly it offends the overall principles and that i am certain we would look at but i dont think its quite at that stage yet
6432695 when the american national anthem is played i feel enormous pride
6432696 my loyalty is for the country that i am representing right now and that is the united states
6432697 i dont know about other people who might have a lot of mixed feelings back in my country seeing the american flag being raised instead of the kenyan flag
6432698 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them

6432711 it was one of washingtons biggest scandals and the republican power broker ralph reed was in the middle of it in deep with convicted felon and lobbyist jack abramoff
6432712 ma am let me say that i don t disagree with anything you said
6432713 one this is the best military weve ever had and its just not big enough two there has never been a draft that i have ever heard of since world war ii that was fair what weve done is we find rich people find a way out and lower income people are the ones that serve so the thing if you could design i might consider it i dont think its necessary i might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally would serve
6432714 we are aware of the media reports and therefore we have to look into it
6432715 figure out how much money you have to spend and then make a list of the items you need and you really need to stick to that list you can cross check it against the list given by your kids school about what supplies they need for that grade level also check it against the items you have in your house
6432716 you can find pre packaged items with a variety of schools supplies in them
6432717 it may be tempting to buy that hundred count box of pencils or the twenty notebooks but you only use a couple at a time and the rest wind up stashed in a drawer somewhere taking up space
6432718 you want to check price but you also want to check the zippers and stitching on the backpacks so they will last for more than one school year
6432719 that way youre not wasting gas driving store to store looking for the best deal
6432720 you can do one stop shopping like here in the glendale galleria with target and jcpenney they have school supplies to accommodate kids from pre school all the way through college
6432721 let them know what the budget is and let them get involved in the decision making process
6432722 then theyre going to learn the value of dollar and also theyre going to be more excited about the items they purchased if your kids love hello kitty high school musical hannah montana you can find so many books binders notebooks featuring that theyre going to be excited about using them in the classroom and theyre not going to leave them on the playground

6432724 its really affected the tone and tenor of the site
6432725 today the commission tells comcast to stop and to disclose to its subscribers how it is going to manage traffic on a going forward basis
6432726 we therefore take another important step to ensure that all consumers have unfettered access to the internet
6432727 although comcasts terms of use statement may have specified that its broadband internet access service was subject to speed and upstream and downstream rate limitations such vague terms are of no practical utility to the average customer
6432728 this order marks a major milestone in internet policy for years the fcc declared that it would take action against any internet service provider caught violating the online rights guaranteed by the agency today the commission has delivered on that promise
6432729 shall encourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all americans
6432730 the practice of degrading consumer ability to share or access video content effectively results in the limiting of deployment of an advanced telecommunications capability
6432731 its a binary outcome it can go one way or another
6432732 they already have an aging product if these new devices are great the stock price will go up if they are late it will go lower
6432733 as part of our efforts to prepare consumers for the transition we have identified television markets in which the largest number of viewers will have to take action to be prepared for the transition six months from now
6432734 this unprecedented nationwide tour by the entire commission is part of our commitment to prepare and educate consumers about the digital television transition
6432735 stations that are transitioning on feb 17 2009 will not be able to retain analog signals for any purpose including emergency broadcasts
6432736 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better
6432737 retail sites no longer make customers choose between convenience and price
6432738 i think the auction was a novelty at the beginning but now people want what they want when they want it
6432739 this management is more willing to ride along with it
6432740 its still a great model for certain types of sales
6432741 the economy has changed dramatically and people just arent eating out as much anymore
6432742 people are cutting back everywhere and a lot of companies including caf dupri are feeling the affect for the past two months business at the caf has been down and if the business isnt making money i feel its a smart move to shut it down bottom line if it doesnt make money it doesnt make sense

6432750 women still see heart disease as a mans disease so it is my hope that this event while being fun and entertaining will be eye opening and educational for all who attend
6432751 we are excited to be partnering with the heart and stroke foundation sa once again and we believe the go red for women wellness workshops will go a long way towards encouraging women their partners friends and family members to make healthier lifestyles choices cigarette smoking is one of the biggest risk factors for heart disease and stroke so we encourage women to consider quitting nicorette has a wide range of nicotine replacement therapy products to suit the individual needs of smokers and has a 25 year clinically proven treatment track record
6432752 it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be im not much of a small talker and i dont think she is either i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years
6432753 everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
6432754 i think it will be ok were both grown women both professionals once we were working it felt like a good fit
6432755 offended mothers were calling up and saying i shouldnt be doing this that they werent going to go see it
6432756 ok dont see it theyre treating it like its pornography and its not its only seven minutes at the end of the play when im naked and im 19 now
6432757 youre in there and there are these hooves flying around and im naked by that point
6432758 we can never be surprised at what vile evil comes from the mouth of a confessed victim of child abuse at the hands of her own parents

6432761 during the dinner mary kate was very playful with joel it was all fun and games but with the olsens nothing is as simple as that nicole exploded at joel and demanded that they leave the party afterward nicole warned him to stay away from mary kate
6432762 after the concert joel invited her back to see the tour bus he showed her some baby photos of harlow joel isnt one to lie or hide things from nicole so the next day he told her about it on the phone
6432763 nicole freaked out joel thought shed respect the fact that he was trying to be honest after all he and mary kate are just friends but nicole was hurt and angry he couldnt deal with it so he hung up and she kept texting him after that

6432765 people are becoming more aware of the negative effects of conventional pesticides at the same time growers are more willing to switch they have more choices and incentive compared to 10 years ago
6432766 i think there has been enough scientific evidence that theres a difference between lets say conventional tomatoes and organic tomatoes in terms of pesticide residues but also improved taste and higher levels of antioxidants
6432767 i think its a combination of the movement of green chemistry trying to protect the environment and peoples thoughts about their own health maybe not even their health but their kids and grandkids health
6432768 while many americans are living paycheck to paycheck to effectively protect ourselves for the future we need to start saving paycheck to paycheck
6432769 our study shows that americans are better at saving money when they are thinking about it month to month on an ongoing basis rather than a long term goal
6432770 we plan on pay raises work bonuses and other monies to come forward but we cannot be thinking this way we need to start saving money every day
6432771 planning too far in advance not only makes consumers over optimistic regarding how much they will save but it also makes them behave in more aggressive and risk seeking ways in other financial arenas
6432772 the easiest thing to do is to be a smarter consumer and make spending and saving decisions thoughtfully on a daily basis that extra cup of coffee every morning carpooling with a co worker and cutting out the extras
6432773 the harder and more prudent thing to do is to mindfully take a portion of your earnings each pay period and save it in the bank
6432774 americans cant solely depend on their retirement plan it will be painful but like that mortgage or car loan payment we need to start thinking about a savings transfer every pay period
6432775 when a man receives hormone therapy initially the treatment works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down
6432776 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
6432777 the androgen receptor acts differently in different cells in prostate tissue
6432778 its always been assumed that blocking the androgen receptor will stop all prostate cells from growing but we have found that thats not the case since current treatment acts non specifically on all the cells having androgen receptors in the prostate blocking the androgen receptor will give mixed results
6432779 while the androgen receptor is really driving prostate cancer in another sense it appears that the receptor also normally inhibits the spread of cancer cells it seems to have a dual role manipulating the androgen receptor can increase or decrease either of these actions depending on precisely how its done
6432780 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
6432781 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
6432782 we found that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself
6432783 we have known for some time that young and middle aged adults who are overweight run a higher risk of death and it was presumed that this held true for older people in fact our results show that the risk of dying is higher only for the most severely obese but that all older people who are overweight are at significantly increased risk of developing problems with mobility and carrying out everyday tasks
6432784 this research is important because a growing proportion of the population is aged 65 or over and more and more of these older people are overweight in fact in most developed countries middle aged and elderly adults are more likely to be obese than people in any other age group these findings have huge significance for the delivery of health care both now and in the future increasing numbers of older people and higher levels of overweight and obesity will lead to a greater burden of disability and ill health and place an immense strain on health and social services the issue is likely to get worse as time goes on and represents a ticking time bomb for health services around the world
6432785 staying a healthy weight can be a fun and relatively easy thing to do even as people get older
6432786 our experience of running supported walking and cycling groups has shown that older people benefit in many ways from regular physical activity
6432787 people are living longer but this study shows that excess weight can have a real impact on the quality of peoples lives which can reduce the benefit of those extra years we must do all we can to encourage older friends or relatives to build enjoyable exercise into their daily routine and develop good habits ourselves to take into our retirement years people can visit 01209 313419 for more advice
6432788 this report highlights the problem of obesity in an increasingly ageing population
6432789 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6432790 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment ldl cholesterol
6432791 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6432792 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher ldl levels
6432793 this is especially true of cancers involving the blood cell system but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6432794 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers
6432795 we need to do a much better job of keeping track of these relationships
6432796 in major trials of statins some do not even report on the number of cancers we need a lot more research in this area in terms of biology virtually nothing is known
6432797 what we need is patient level data to see whether a pattern emerges of different risks at different ldl levels
6432798 but when we give medications to millions we need information about risks versus benefits
6432799 there are some question marks and they may change the risk benefit ratio for some patients

6432885 automatic thrust reverser deployment will be one of the things that air crash investigators will be looking at
6432886 the plane would have been designed to continue its climb if an engine failed on take off and pilots are certainly trained to cope with this
6432887 but the hotter the weather is the harder it is for a plane to climb conditions at madrid would certainly have been which degrades both aircraft performance and engine power so may have reduced the aeroplanes ability to climb this may have caused the ground impact and subsequent fire
6432888 for this level of loss of life at madrid however the aircraft was presumably not under the level of control that an engine fire alone would probably cause
6432889 if it is correct that the aircraft was taking off and skidded off the runway then this sounds like an aborted takeoff
6432890 the rules of operation are such that a pilot must be able to abort a take off while the aircraft is still on the ground and have enough runway left to come to a stop using maximum brakes maximum braking could be severe enough for brakes to catch fire and tyres to burst
6432891 however the aircraft and its brakes are designed to cope with this situation the brakes are anti lock and anti skid and the aircraft should travel in a straight line even under maximum braking
6432892 the investigation should not rule out human error as well as any engineering fault in engineering it can be deduced pretty quickly where the fault or problem stemmed from and rectified
6432893 on take off pilots reach a point of no return known as v1 speed which is usually reached about two seconds before take off
6432894 if you go above v1 and abort the take off there is insufficient room at the end of the runway and there is the chance of going off the end of the runway at a very fast speed and things can then go very badly wrong
6432895 the normal rule is that if you go beyond v1 and something goes wrong you take off anyway if for example a tyre blew you would take off
6432896 a problem at the point of take off is very challenging for the pilot if something happens at the point of v1 he is committed to taking off
6432897 if there is an engine failure at this point he is flying an aircraft at very low speed
6432898 deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life
6432899 philip joins me in sending our warm and heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of those who have died and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to those who have been injured

6432923 we had been discussing a viral campaign for three or four months now placing some stuff on the net so some of this was just wacky timing
6432924 the whole concept behind our campaign was that we wanted people to be looking at our web site while they were thinking they were looking at someone elses
6432925 and when i think about how it might affect fall out boy all i can say is that petes a clever bloke and he probably wouldve done the same thing had he thought of it
6432926 i mean think about it the two campaigns are very similar theirs is supposed to look like an ominous organization thats mucking around the way the two campaigns crossed didnt hurt anyone
6432927 the whole idea was mocking other sites and if life went according to plan you wouldve seen that continue instead it got ripped to shreds overnight
6432928 but like i said this wasnt done maliciously and everything ive heard about pete is that hes a marketing kind of guy hes the king of making people talk and ruffling feathers so he wouldve done the same thing if he could have so if fall out boy fans are mad about this whole thing well all i can say is that pete wouldve done the same thing

6432931 congresswoman tubbs jones was an outstanding friend and an amazingly productive congresswoman for our city and greater cleveland she never shied from difficult issues and in fact she led on them locally i believe that her support for pro equality positions directly propelled the passage of legislation which has positively impacted our families

6432936 we have to realize that it isnt just antivirals that we need
6432937 we need to make sure that were prepared to treat people with antibiotics
6432938 certainly the idea that resident bacteria flora already present could play a role in developing pneumonia is relatively reasonable

6432955 these results demonstrate very dramatically that hiv infection of cells associated with the bbb in conjunction with lps exposure contributes to bbb breakdown
6432956 so when hiv infection occurs we seem to have a 1 2 3 combination of punches working in concert to facilitate entry of hiv infected monocytes into the bbb protected brain hiv infection of monocytes increases their capacity to cross even an intact bbb hiv infection in the gut releases lps into the bloodstream allowing it to erode the bbb and hiv infection of the cells of the bbb makes them more sensitive to the deleterious effects of lps
6432957 ideally we would promptly start newly diagnosed hiv infected patients on a treatment to reinforce their bbbs so that hiv cant penetrate it and perhaps we could even strengthen the bbbs of people whove been infected for quite a while

6432999 fpl well represents a model of true integration in health benefit design
6433000 the approach is employee centered not program centered all five elements are managed as an integrated whole and it is the clearest way an employer can communicate that its employees are an asset
6433001 the approach is to take care of the complete individual
6433002 our role is to identify those with a chronic health issue and to provide services and support to manage the condition and move that person to better health the other emphasis is to get healthy people to stay healthy
6433003 improving the health and well being of the people we serve

6433008 many unstable countries change their currency every few years to help control runaway inflation and often to curb corruption the african country ghana just looped off three zeros in their currency this was done more to help control the rampant illegal diamond business in that country than to help inflation there was an estimated 25 percent of the currency in criminal hands outside the countrys banking system the turn in period was short only 60 days and the customer turning in old currency had to have an existing bank account
6433009 when the ruble became an international currency the first thing the russian government did was print new currency and give only 90 days to turn in old currency to convert to new currency
6433010 they also put a temporary freeze on new bank accounts being opened during the turn in period this left all the tens of millions of rubles outside russia as worthless a successful investor made several thousand percent in just the first year
6433011 today investors are interested in the chinese yuan the vietnamese dong and the iraqi dinar to name a few
6433012 the lesson learned is to make sure you comply with the issuing countries laws on their currency and business
6433013 to safely invest in any of these countries you need a state approved business license
6433014 because we do licensing in iraq we do make it easier to do business there where licensing has gone up dramatically for foreign companies often times it is better to wait until the currency actually makes it to the international market before investing or doing business

6433210 lediglich meine bedingungs lose freilassung und meine vollst ndige rehabilitierung als unschuldiger mensch sowie die sofortige freilassung von andrej kim und sergej parsjukiewitsch k nnen wirklich als ein realer schritt des belarussischen staates in richtung einer demokratisierung der gesellschaft gesehen werden
6433211 he is not loaded with millions like other leaders are sometimes he worried about the cost of things hes not someone whose hand had been in the cookie jar
6433212 have to work harder to fit in and to have a useful productive role
6433213 i think this research does to some extent call some of those assumptions into question
6433214 grazie a dio il mio amico putin mi ha ascoltato altrimenti col cavolo che i carri armati russi si sarebbero fermati a quindici chilometri da tbilisi abbiamo evitato un inutile bagno di sangue

6433224 we want to hear from as many people as possible about their experiences at the school
6433225 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6433226 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6433227 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6433228 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6433229 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6433230 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6433231 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6433232 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in
6433233 theres no way in hell im voting for the old establishment
6433234 now since im back at quarterback im reverting back to wide receiver things its pretty interesting the way its kind of different from a quarterbacks perspective to a wide receivers point of view

6433236 i took the no 2 reps the last couple of days of practice because of jbs situation
6433237 were working him back in it and getting him back on the field
6433238 coach galloway will throw me in there and tell me to run the play and he expects me to know it just like all the other wide receivers
6433239 just because im back at quarterback i still have to study my wide receiver blocking and my other techniques at wide receiver
6433240 its definitely the most freshmen in the two deep since ive been here
6433241 i guess they did a great job of recruiting and bringing guys in and getting them ready

6433251 there are a lot of games being played here with the democratic majority they refuse to actually drill here drill now and pay less for gasoline
6433252 the policy im supporting is the all of the above approach
6433253 a vote for eric massa is a vote for speaker nancy pelosi and higher gasoline prices
6433254 the current decrease in price is due to a decrease in demand which has forced millions of americans to make drastic changes and choices in their life families are abandoning vacations schools are considering a reduction to a four day week and hard working americans are being forced to schedule their lives based on how much gasoline they will have to use to get to church doctors office or work
6433255 all told undriven trips since the start of 2008 amount to some thirty billion pounds of unreleased co2 clearly the only way to change americas consumption habits is by making those habits more expensive

6433266 in initial work at the simulation center we were able to demonstrate collaboration with engineering resources at one of our california sites in a real time test of a missile guidance package for a defense client
6433267 with its multiple elements of the system design hardware and software engineering and finally logistics challenges the atk simulation center was one of the most exciting projects we have tackled for any client
6433268 we are very pleased with its success and look forward to further collaboration to support atk projects and programs

6433309 the examination staff note that we regularly communicate with portfolio managers at other hedge funds about investment and trading ideas
6433310 such conversations permit us to test our hypotheses and refine our thinking and as a result we believe that participating in give and take with other managers is in the best interest of our investors
6433311 our outside counsel has examined this matter thoroughly and assured us that our position is consistent with securities laws and that we have not violated any law in connection with these communications
6433312 regulatory matters are certainly playing an significant role in the life of hedge funds as the obligations and demands of the current regulatory environment continue to increase

6433323 advancing this work through the open standards process offers tangible benefits for device and platform vendors developers and consumers alike
6433324 these standards will enable the development of a new generation of enterprise enabled resources which can be automatically discovered and then function seamlessly together
6433325 this work will make it possible for a wide variety of devices to find each other and interoperate using web services techniques
6433326 the project will leverage existing basic web services methods to expand the scope of soa networks to a much broader range of machines and endpoints
6433327 ws dd is complementary to standards such as uddi and it will help improve the scale and flexibility of applications through the improved dynamic discovery of devices such as smart phones and services that may not be connected ca will continue to work closely with other industry leaders to enable a new generation of management security and governance solutions that support these more dynamic flexible applications
6433328 the formation of the ws dd technical committee is an important milestone and builds upon mature ws base protocols by expanding the scope to include the wide variety of devices being used today in homes and enterprises defining protocols for discovering securely consuming and exposing web services in a lightweight footprint that suits these devices has the potential to greatly broaden the reach of web services to meet customers needs discovery of enterprise resources whether devices or web services can help make large scale soa implementations more robust and simpler to manage
6433329 red hat is pleased to be involved with ws dd as we believe this is an important missing piece of the ws standardization effort particularly as it applies to the ongoing move towards more autonomous and large scale infrastructures that we are seeing being developed

6433648 i saw his older brother yesterday after it happened and he told me he was due to get his gcse results today when i spoke to him the brother was in a shocking state
6433649 i heard that he was a good kid and wasnt involved in anything bad its absolutely shocking
6433650 to my dear friend ahmed rip hope your afterlife is the best
6433651 at this early stage we believe he had fallen from a block of flats one line of inquiry officers are investigating is that the boy may have been chased prior to the fall

6433655 mortality and cardiovascular events in patients treated with homocysteine lowering b vitamins after coronary angiography
6433656 vitamins are meant to be taken for preventative measures to support long term good health rather than treat disease
6433657 this study is a randomized controlled trial rtc which has become the gold standard for establishing the efficacy of drugs unfortunately it is poorly suited to the evaluation of the effects of nutrients this type of study is doomed to fail since nutrients and drugs have two different mechanisms
6433658 eat a healthy diet exercise and take your b vitamins as needed research shows b vitamins support heart health cognitive function and provide many other benefits when taken long term as part of an overall healthy plan
6433659 elotuzumab provides us with the opportunity to develop and market an innovative therapy that has the potential to meaningfully address the significant unmet medical need in multiple myeloma
6433660 consistent with our companys strategy to integrate external innovation and to expand our capabilities this collaboration will further strengthen our pipeline of agents targeting hematologic malignancies which includes sprycel r and tanespimycin an hsp90 inhibitor from our recent acquisition of kosan biosciences
6433661 we are delighted to enter this global alliance with bristol myers squibb which we believe will maximize the potential benefit of elotuzumab to patients and highlight the value of our scientific discoveries and antibody technologies to the field
6433662 in addition bristol myers squibb brings extensive oncology development experience and resources and we look forward to collaborating with them to increase the scope of the elotuzumab development program moving forward
6433663 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss
6433664 embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propagated and expanded indefinitely providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy
6433665 we show that up to 65 of the blood cells underwent multiple maturation events that resulted in the extrusion of the nucleus
6433666 they formed enucleated erythrocytes with a diameter of 6 8 m which is similar to normal red blood cells we also showed that the cells could express adult globin and respond normally to biochemical changes
6433667 although more work is required before this can move into the clinic we are pleased with the rapid progress that is being made by our scientists and others we are optimistic about the potential future role for stem cells as a donorless source of blood for transfusion
6433668 we are investigating the case after four convicts tested positive for drugs
6433669 whats been lost is the idea that a banker has some responsibility to protect the clients interest
6433670 the most efficient way to organize economic activity may also prove to be the most brittle congress needs to consider the costs of volatility and instability
6433671 sometimes the cost of regulation might be far greater than its benefits
6433672 these are the problems financial markets should have created products to match but they created risks and now were bearing the consequences of this so called innovation
6433673 we have to learn how to handle the shocks when they occur
6433674 we may need a financial instrument administration that tests the robustness of financial instruments and approves only the uses where they can do no harm
6433675 our repayment rate is very high like 98 or 99

6433697 the price of a powerball ticket remains unchanged at 1 even though our players know that the cost of everything else has gone up since powerball sales commenced over 16 years ago we didnt want to raise powerballs price in our current economy

6433706 its a shame to move so suddenly after all the work weve put into this space but we need to feel our artists and audience are coming to a welcoming healthy setting and were going to make that true

6433734 as the first ifc infraventures investment in the region el salto hydro underscores our commitment to promoting renewable energy as a viable alternative for improving access to power in developing countries
6433735 this investment reflects our commitment to the private sectors role in improving the quality and availability of power in nicaragua
6433736 we intend to scale up our involvement in the countrys power sector where government policies support private participation
6433737 our priorities are clear diversification and sustainability we need to create an environment where the overall burden of work for businesses and the government is reduced creating more opportunities for a vibrant and competitive private sector azerbaijan has realized consistent economic reforms and we cooperate actively with ifc in promoting private sector development which is crucial for their implementation

6433748 we knew that we could not deploy f 15 jets with bombs because it was not possible to differentiate between french troops and taliban fighters

6433784 the government is clear that it will not be seeking an early election at any time parliament can defeat the government and provoke an early election if that is what the opposition irresponsibly chooses to do
6433785 if parliament was not functioning well that would show a lack of confidence in the government its a no brainer that wed have to go to the people to try and settle it
6433786 im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively

6433790 we have world class competitors in the cycling event and this is one of the races the riders want to win everyone wants the chris thater on their resume
6433791 were going to have a really dynamic event this year because weve got 15 teams with six or more riders and 7 squads which have reached their eight rider limit
6433792 this really creates the kind of team dynamics that allow squads to protect key riders until its time to make their move toyota united colavita sutter home kelly benefits rite aid and toshiba santo are among the teams that really know how to shred a field
6433793 we offer two sports to athletes and sponsors and we focus on healthy lifestyles and the perils of driving while intoxicated

6433797 the pricing will change theyll work their way down to something that is going to be more reasonable
6433798 the timing is pretty good theyre in the back to school time period and its a lead up to the christmas shopping season
6433799 it takes advantage of rogers investment in its high speed 3g network the hsdpa

6433843 mine operators that repeatedly violate mine safety standards must be held accountable for their actions
6433844 we are now contesting all violations issued to murray energy mines including a 4 000 violation which was a result of the section of law governing dust control having been written 29 times in the past 24 months
6433845 and the impact this could have on murray energy and the possibility of flagrant violations for repeated failure
6433846 one of our more level headed inspectors said the mines are doing less in compliance since murray took over and that if you want something corrected or done different you would have to cite it to get it fixed
6433847 but to have as many as murray has in one mine in such a short time is unbelievable
6433848 just like gunpowder it just makes a big powderkeg in the mine

6433855 to our knowledge the confidential internal communications we examined provide the first strong documentary evidence of how a pharmaceutical company framed a marketing effort as a clinical trial
6433856 physicians have long suspected that seeding trials go on and that theyve been an effective tool used by pharmaceutical companies to jump start sales for medications that are coming to market
6433857 the trial was designed and executed in the spirit of the merck marketing principles
6433858 was the result of a close collaboration between cdp and marketing and focused on a gap not filled by the pivotal clinical program
6433859 execution of the trial was of the highest level involving integration of the field marketing and cdp
6433860 they know about the techniques that other companies use what works and what doesnt work they spend a lot of money in marketing and so i think its reasonable to imagine that other companies are running trials very similar to advantage
6433861 the distinction between clinical research people and marketing people at a lot of pharma companies is not as clear as you might think
6433862 the most important question is is the trial fairly designed
6433863 many people like me have argued that we need to have a different system for deciding what questions are going to be answered by trials and what their designs will be for answering the questions companies cant look at both sides of the coin theyre obligated by their fiduciary responsibilities to look at questions that are likely to come out positive for them
6433864 is that this turned out to be a very high profile case from my view they were acting like most companies act and ive certainly seen more egregious behavior
6433865 were not allowed nor would i want to sign a contract with a company that works that way
6433866 to my knowledge the majority of industry sponsored trials do not have an independent executive committee or an independent data monitoring committee
6433867 people need to know what they are signing up for people need to trust the science behind clinical trials and seeding trials shake that trust and trust in the scientific process they shake the trust of the physicians who participate as well
6433868 patients risked their health in this case solely to boost merck profits
6433869 the merck documents do tell us that deception is the key to a successful seeding trial seeding trials can occur only because the company does not disclose its true purpose to anyone who could say no it is also true that seeding trials exist only because physicians say yes to a deal that seems too good to be true
6433870 we hope that a study like this if brought to the attention of the public will get people to ask more questions about what the objectives of a trial are and also from the physicians standpoint to think about what kind of trial theyre participating in
6433871 its hard for physicians to say no to trials like this which can be very lucrative and prestigious
6433872 all authors were compensated for participation in litigation against merck at the request of plaintiffs

6433905 they will get married to more than one man and get pregnant without knowing who the father is
6433906 eventually due to despair hopelessness and fear they get exploited to commit such crimes as they become unwanted by society
6433907 although it remains far from clear whether the women committed the crimes of which they were accused the tale they shared from their barren cell offers a peek into the violent and claustrophobic world in which women are groomed to become suicide bombers
6433908 then i went to grab it and there was nothing

6433911 not provide the amount of security information the college now requires to manage the access control of students and staff
6433912 new college decided to address this situation as part of a rolling upgrade of its security facilities and enhance the system with a modern state of the art mifare contactless access system this would need to be fully capable of integrating with and working alongside the existing system until it was eventually replaced while providing full audit trail information and control of student movement
6433913 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6433914 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6433915 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6433916 there was fire from machine guns on american planes that were guided by american special forces and we have no information that enables us to consider that the french soldiers were killed under fire from nato planes
6433917 fifteen to 20 minutes after the engagement of our forces a support section left the base camp and took around 40 to 50 minutes to get to the scene
6433918 there was fire from machine guns on american planes that were guided by american special forces and we have no information that enables us to consider that the french soldiers were killed under fire from nato planes
6433919 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6433920 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6433921 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6433922 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6433923 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6433924 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6433925 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6433926 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6433927 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6433928 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6433929 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6433930 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6433931 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6433932 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6433933 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6433934 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6433935 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6433936 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6433937 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6433938 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6433939 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6433940 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6433941 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6433942 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6433943 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6433944 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6433945 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6433946 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6433947 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6433948 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6433949 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6433950 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6433951 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6433952 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6433953 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6433954 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6433955 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6433956 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6433957 take off accidents are very very rare you reach a point in take off when it is unlikely that anything can go wrong but if things do go wrong they can go wrong very quickly
6433958 on take off pilots reach a point of no return known as v1 speed which is usually reached about two seconds before take off
6433959 if you go above v1 and abort the take off there is insufficient room at the end of the runway and there is the chance of going off the end of the runway at a very fast speed and things can then go very badly wrong
6433960 they should be able to work out whether the plane was in a flyable condition in those last few moments
6433961 as a city renowned for our passion civic pride love of sports and great sense of humor we know that no one can tell our story better than our own people
6433962 we are asking all of those who believe in bringing the world to chicago for the 2016 olympic games to tell their own story of
6433963 chicago 2016 is truly a community wide effort and nothing will speak louder to the world than passionate chicagoans telling their own chicago 2016 story
6433964 through the chicago 2016 channel the people of chicago are inviting the world to our city in 2016 we believe that no one can tell the chicago story more authentically and persuasively than our people

6433967 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6433968 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6433969 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6433970 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6433971 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6433972 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6433973 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6433974 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6433975 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6433976 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6433977 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6433978 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6433979 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6433980 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6433981 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6433982 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6433983 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6433984 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6433985 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6433986 jaysus paddy sure we dont have 15 footballs in the whole county
6433987 stormed through the championship with their weaving style of open handpassing breaking a 33 years cavan spell of dominance
6433988 pat ohara saw that a meath defender was going to trip him and with clever anticipation he hopped over the outstretched foot and kicked the ball to the net
6433989 the whistle went almost simultaneously with the kick in the one of the clearest instances where the application of the advantage rule would have made all the difference
6433990 but i think thats done through squeezing more than breaking

6433994 chief investigator gary howard told the knoxville news sentinel a drug sniffing dog smelled something on the truck during a traffic stop near crossville last week a search of the vehicle found no drugs but did find the cash in a hidden compartment
6433995 multiple agencies were involved in the stop and search howard said the money will likely be awarded by a court to those agencies
6433996 do you have any large amounts of cash on you
6433997 if you want your money the dea has it good luck
6433998 that very week i had been toying with the idea of blogging going so far as to have set up an as yet unpublished first post
6433999 blogs and wikis are now becoming mainstream communication tools but who in the department of the navy is actually using them
6434000 were incredibly fortunate to have pete geren secretary of the u s army and general george casey chief of staff of the u s army join us via phone for the bloggers roundtable panel
6434001 i value the diary tremendously but im scared stiff its going to get lost
6434002 the army does not routinely monitor blogs regarding postings of specific personnel or groups of personnel it is not standard practice for the military to target or single out individual military blogs unless a particular blog has been brought to the attention of the chain of command or other dod department of defense officials for gross opsec operational security violations
6434003 the success of that is what will be the turning point for the soldiers to come home the faster we reconstruct the faster the soldiers can come back
6434004 there are instantaneous communications taking place around the world and we need to figure out how to take advantage of that opportunity instead of looking at it as a nemesis
6434005 you can call it strategic communication you can call it information engagement i like to call it operating in the information domain of the 21st century
6434006 so i decided after reading some other milblogs to start my own to vent my frustrations and try to keep my sanity intact as much as possible
6434007 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6434008 human rights watch hrw researchers documented additional russian cluster munitions attacks during the conflict in georgia refuting russias earlier denials that it used the weapon
6434009 many more people could be killed or wounded unless russia allows professional demining organisations to enter at once to clean affected areas
6434010 human rights watch hrw researchers documented additional russian cluster munitions attacks during the conflict in georgia refuting russias earlier denials that it used the weapon
6434011 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6434012 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6434013 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6434014 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6434015 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6434016 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6434017 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6434018 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6434019 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6434020 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6434021 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6434022 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6434023 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6434024 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6434025 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6434026 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6434027 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6434028 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6434029 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6434030 who are open to doing something on the production side
6434031 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6434032 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6434033 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6434034 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

6434039 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6434073 ich will nicht anma end klingen aber es gab einen gro en territorialen konflikt bei der gr ndung der nato der hie ost deutschland

6434075 schlie lich hat deutschland in der nato nicht nur seine teilung berwunden sondern auch durch demokratischen frieden seine sehr schwierige geschichte mit den nachbarn
6434076 wir m ssen uns an diese geschichte erinnern wenn wir ber die territorialen probleme georgiens reden
6434077 georgien wird wenn es das will mitglied der nato werden
6434078 l nder die selbst in regionale oder innere konflikte verstrickt sind k nnen aus meiner sicht nicht mitglieder der nato sein wir sind ein b ndnis zur verteidigung der sicherheit und keines in dem einzelne mitglieder noch mit ihrer eigenen sicherheit zu tun haben

6434097 it could take a couple of hours for our help desk to reproduce an issue from a users description of events
6434098 but it wasnt burdensome until we started planning to extend our web based policy platform externally to brokers then we realized we needed a better way
6434099 we wanted to track activities on knowledge workers desktops and create event logs transparently in the background whether the users were internal or external
6434100 but everything we found was targeted at development troubleshooting with the exception of some emerging companies that we disqualified as too young
6434101 they were using the bmc product but not as extensively as we envisioned
6434102 so we brought in bmc and discovered appsight offered traceability from redmond wash based microsoft windows and java at the front end all the way through back end servers and dropping off into the cobol path
6434103 a windows enabled server was acquired and deployed for the application with recording agents loaded onto each supported application server
6434104 we included about a page of documentation on the new error reporting process
6434105 in short a popup window appears that provides users with directions to follow then the information is automatically e mailed to tech support
6434106 initially we set up the solution aggressively causing event logs to be about 10mb
6434107 users consistently said it was taking too long to release their machines so we fine tuned the number of recorded activities which reduced the logs to about 5mb after about eight months of internal use appsight was included when the new policy platform was released to our brokers
6434108 previously whenever a tester found a bug it required several interactions with a developer to clarify the issue
6434109 now developers can simply play back the recording of the failed test case
6434110 in develpoment the number of tester developer interactions has dropped from an average of three to one
6434111 plus were reducing productivity barriers inherent to working across time zones cultures and languages because developers keep working rather than taking a day or two just to understand a testing issue
6434112 also weve discovered about 25 percent of incidents are actually training issues this eliminates sending out analysts to locate reported system outages at business units only to determine that a new user has failed to click the proper screen tab

6434114 on the night of aug 7 saakashvili ordered an artillery barrage against tskhinvali and sent an armored column to occupy the town he apparently hoped that western support would protect georgia from major russian retaliation even though russian peacekeepers were almost certainly killed or wounded in the georgian assault it was a huge miscalculation
6434115 was foolish and possibly criminal but unlike putin he has led his country in a broadly democratic direction curbed corruption and presided over rapid economic growth that has not relied as russias mostly does on high oil and gas prices

6434152 my campaigns on behalf of some of our most vulnerable people are coming to fruition the forced marriage civil protection act comes into effect in september

6434154 i would like to thank the people of my constituency who it has been an absolute privilege to represent for the last 11 years in parliament
6434155 of course none of us are aware of when the next election will be called but my work and that of my office will continue on behalf of constituents until then

6434166 to get back into the work force and be able to see that i can succeed and that what i wrote down on my resume is true and that i can do it and i have a lot to offer has really decreased stress

6434172 what labor is trying is to do in my judgment is help employers understand that if you support the employee hell perk back up again
6434173 its a bit like being on team with a good coach youve got a good coach that performer somehow finds an extra amount of energy an extra effort
6434174 what were hoping to do is to give each one of these veterans a little bit of extra coaching a little bit of extra help that will get them to the finish line

6434284 the candidate republicans should be clamoring for is the one liberals are most feverishly denouncing that is mitt romney by a landslide
6434285 he just tripped off a chair he was getting ready to speak somebody aimed a gun at him and him he dove for the floor
6434286 prominent evangelical leaders are warning sen john mccain against picking former massachusetts gov mitt romney as his running mate saying their troops will abandon the republican ticket on election day if that happens
6434287 they say mr romney lacks trust on issues such as outlawing abortion and opposing same sex marriage and because he is a mormon opposition is particularly powerful among those who supported former arkansas gov mike huckabee in the republican presidential primaries earlier this year
6434288 other well placed christian conservatives say that although many evangelical leaders could accept and work for a mccain romney ticket mr huckabees supporters tend to be rabid in their views against mr romney because of his faith they do not regard mormonism as a christian denomination
6434289 i am wholeheartedly convinced that mitt romney can be trusted to uphold the values and principles most important to me as a political conservative and an evangelical christian again i am not being paid and i am not interested in a job in a romney administration i would not accept one even if offered as im still raising three teenagers neither is my public relations firm involved in any way i am involved because i believe the stakes are high perhaps higher than ever before in my life
6434290 cyclone power technologies is a great example of how american ingenuity can help solve our countrys energy crisis

6434297 with a global resource of 205 million ounces of silver and 4 3 billion pounds of zinc hackett stands as one of the largest undeveloped silver deposits in the world
6434298 as hackett river becomes a development project as with any project in the industry the considerable lead times required for feasibility work permitting financing and construction can have detrimental effects on a companys share price as the market waits out the evolution of the project as a management team we believe the best way to mitigate against depreciating recognition in the market is to create value and provide leverage within the company during this lead time i believe that we can do that by acquiring another asset one that would complement our advanced hackett river project this year we have done the essential work needed to push hackett river and our other exploration projects forward but have focussed on preserving our treasury the current market presents many affordable opportunities which combined with our excellent balance sheet puts us in a very strong position over the past two months management has been proactive in communicating within the m amp a community we have been and continue to be presented with proposals and ideas which we are now evaluating although the company would prefer to focus in the canadian north we will consider opportunities in other politically stable jurisdictions
6434299 from the inception of the cct through its final design we have integrated new and innovative specifications to address market needs on a global basis
6434300 our engineering team worked hard in developing this revolutionary device that encompasses all the proven features of the current valimed vm model as well as adding new reporting capabilities and software enhancements to further increase the operating value of the system
6434301 the vision has become a reality we have received very positive feedback from our validation sites and have incorporated input from our international customers and partners in the final design of the cct the new valimed model cct will be displayed at major pharmacy conferences in france spain and italy this fall and we are very excited about going forward
6434302 the shipment of ccts to international customers marks another major milestone in our international development plans
6434303 he is a bloke who is influential he is a bloke who is inspirational because he does intimidate and blokes alongside him tend to respond to that
6434304 it is good to have him back but most importantly it is good for him
6434305 he didnt enjoy watching the last outing and hopefully he brings that grumpiness with him
6434306 you dont need to read too much into that because the volume of game time wont change just the order
6434307 it is not a reflection of ranking so to speak it is the order we are using this week we will be looking to matty to put the after burners on and well respond to what we see
6434308 it is going to be dry it is going to be fast so that order serves
6434309 we have got versatility in the mix and in terms of covering fullback ryan cross will do that
6434310 he has background in that position and he has done well with each opportunity he has got
6434311 at times there it was obvious we took the wrong option
6434312 a couple of times it was on and we just didnt pull it off so skill execution and wrong options a couple of times there were off but the thing is were having a go its just when to take them weve just got to be a bit more clinical when we do do it

6434316 it is important for us to stop playing too much rugby in our half we have been playing a hell of a lot of rugby in our own half and although there have been scoring opportunities that we have created it is has not helped us
6434317 it is difficult because last year we won the world cup playing conservative rugby by kicking the ball when we were in our own half and only running it when we were in attacking positions
6434318 people said that we were playing rugby that is unwatchable but at this level it is about winning and in the tri nations so far we have seen that it is the team that kicks the most that wins
6434319 tactical kicking has played a big role in determining the results of all the games that have been played so far the all blacks have kicked the most of any team in the competition and they top the tri nations log that does not mean that the rugby has to be boring or unattractive just that the attacks must come when the attack is on
6434320 when i was captaining the stormers in the last super 14 match against the lions we found to our cost that playing all out running rugby does not on its own bring results
6434321 i dont think it would be a risk for us to look at scoring four tries for attacking rugby is not always just about running the ball field position is important and playing a structured game
6434322 if you keep to your structures for the first part of the match then often you will find that in the last 15 to 20 minutes the game opens up and you have an opportunity to score the tries that you need
6434323 it is important though to build a platform first you have to play off a platform for the defensive lines of the all blacks and australia have just been too good
6434324 good play at the breakdowns depends on a collective effort it demands input from all fifteen players the performance at the breakdowns does become more effective if the approach is more structured for if the game is pre planned for three or four phases then the players know where they have to be

6434384 children have a right to play outside their own homes i have a six and a two year old and while my eldest child will be at school my younger child will be at home with me and i wont be able to take her out for a walk
6434385 the health and safety of our children is a lot more important than the construction of eight houses
6434386 i cannot understand how they gave permission to allow such a thing take place
6434387 i have a six year old daughter and i wont feel safe here now if heavy construction traffic is allowed pass through because the roads are to narrow im appalled at the councils decision it is not the building of eight new houses that concerns me but the health and safety issues that will arise as a result of their construction
6434388 it is totally unacceptable to allow heavy trucks plough through a new estate surely there must have been alternative routes and an alternative solution could have been reached
6434389 at that stage there was water coming to my house through both the front door and the back door we were ankle deep in water and there was nothing we could do we tried to make contact with the council to ask them to close off the road because the passing vehicles were causing waves in our houses
6434390 we couldnt stay here in a flooded house with no power so my children and i had to go and stay with my sister for the night
6434391 its all very well being insured but my house has been flooded on several occasions now and i have to keep doing up my house after it i was flooded in 1992 again in 2003 and here we go again its just not right
6434392 the floors doors skirting and walls were destroyed the house is a complete mess and we have taken up the insurance companys offer to cover the cost of relocating for a while
6434393 i went out and spent almost 900 on school books for my teenage sons which i put under the stairs they are completely destroyed now and we have to throw them out
6434394 we encouraged everyone to do the best they could i am delighted for all the students their parents and teachers who put in a huge effort
6434395 we had a couple of outstanding students and we were delighted
6434396 the standard was high and the parents and students were very happy it was a very successful year and its a tribute to the students and their teachers
6434397 we were fairly in line with the national aver age
6434398 the vast majority seem to have gotten the points they were looking for however the maths was down on what it usually is
6434399 some students perhaps fared better than they may have deserved
6434400 people who worked hard achieved the results they wanted however there were also those who did not put in the time or the effort and this morning wasnt easy for them
6434401 the negativity of the national papers this morning left a lot to be desired and is definitely not the picture we want to be painting for students and parents today
6434402 a few got over 400 points and a few more got over 500 points and many of those who walked out the door this morning seem to have achieved the course that they wanted
6434403 its not something we are proud of that happened but its a fact

6434408 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement

6434410 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6434411 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6434412 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6434413 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6434414 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6434415 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6434416 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation

6434419 and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6434420 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6434421 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible

6434505 last night was yet another reminder that forecasts to the contrary the mets young players are outdoing their yankee counterparts in 2008 murphy appeared on no top 100 or even top 300 prospect lists before the season and pelfrey not hughes or kennedy seemed the pitcher most likely to end up back at triple a
6434506 the yankee system got the praise yet the mets had enough pieces not only to land santana but to sprinkle their roster with youngsters thriving in late august

6434509 sebbene noi possiamo commettere un peccato alla fine ci meritiamo tutti una seconda possibilit a volte vale la pena di sacrificarsi affinch gli altri possano trarne benefici
6434510 alcuni siti americani parlano gi della seconda possibilit che le macchine darebbero agli uomini siglando una pace tra i due eserciti e tornando a convivere insieme in puro stile
6434511 if people want to assess the blame to me thats ok i mean i can take whatever it is that people are going to dish out
6434512 we had good chemistry the hand was back there she was there i dont know what happened
6434513 then i went to grab it and there was nothing its kind of the way its been happening to me this olympics
6434514 but i know its my job to get the guy the baton and i didnt do that
6434515 youre old enough for your wants not to hurt you
6434516 so from the study of literature we learn that life is sad comic heroic vicious dignified ridiculous and endlessly amusing sometimes by turns sometimes all at once but never more grotesquely amusing than when a supposedly great thinker comes along to insist that he has discovered and nattily formulated the single key to its understanding
6434517 its usually in a topical lotion or a paste its not administered by mouth
6434518 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
6434519 he knows he will get a hard time in prison because of what he has been convicted of
6434520 he will find the sentence very difficult to deal with
6434521 this was persistent abuse of a vulnerable girl you groomed her and on occasions were violent towards her just to gratify your sexual urges
6434522 you have done damage to her and you have little or no mitigation
6434523 across west cumbria we are targeting violent crime and anti social behaviour on weekends
6434524 it is part of our respect campaign we realise that it will have an impact on the number of people arrested
6434525 we have prepared ourselves that workington cells will be at capacity the cells in whitehaven have now been designated by the chief constable to be used whitehaven has six cells in use

6434527 the game of billiards has destroyed my naturally sweet disposition
6434528 the flowers the gorgeous mystic multi colored flowers are not the flowers of life but people yes people are the true flowers of life and it has been a most precious pleasure to have temporarily strolled in your garden
6434529 if it wasnt for erica i wouldnt know just how evil i am
6434530 meeting erica was a party by itself theres nothing like a meeting of the minds sometimes you feel more at home with someone youve never seen before than with people who have been in the background for years
6434531 i think i should be very careful with what i say lest folks get the idear were lesbos or something
6434532 you always succeed in making me laugh or cry and think and learn thank you for your blog its a treasure
6434533 youre such a delicate flower i want you to write the blurb for the dust jacket when i finally write my novel
6434534 thats all right erica you can talk dirty to me in kerrville
6434535 you used to be fun you now act like a fascist
6434536 i think someone oughta take ericas comments from all the blogs she visits and mash em together into a new blog
6434537 erica you possess formidable talent i am impressed yet slightly repulsed
6434538 i find myself wandering the blogosphere to read ericas comments almost as much as to read everyones posts really
6434539 oh my gawd what a cutie she is bright eyed and full of wonder i could just listen to that accent all day
6434540 oh erica it is always good to know that brooklyn is in the house
6434541 i like you just the way you are a dooshbag
6434542 girl you are slicker than cow patties on wet dew in the morning and you can play half rubber better than anyone
6434543 one of the sweetest most intelligent and perceptive ladies i have never met
6434544 erica has cornered the market on crap blogging in a highly disgusting but yet entertaining way
6434545 i can have a mason jar of grade a pure d buck goat pee especially delivered to the troll of your choice at any given time
6434546 erica has a heart two sizes too big for her may god bless her and keep her
6434547 omg i so totally rate right now erica has left anti nj words in the comments here on my blog
6434548 beating erica sherman at pool was a rare treat and i think perhaps people should know even at the expense of possibly coming off as a braggart for going on and on about beating this aforementioned individual at her own game
6434549 china julia child and yiddish how do these things go together why in a post by erica of course need you ask lol
6434550 i dont do memes and i dont do links i do do gratuitous sex you know my email
6434551 as you gaze into the mullet remember that the mullet also gazes into you
6434552 by the time i went to grab it there was nothing
6434553 some people say if it hits your hand you should have it im a veteran ive run all kinds of relays ive never dropped a stick in my life this is kind of upsetting i cant believe it
6434554 before roadtriphelper hotel booking was inefficient and very time consuming the location of the hotel was very important during my travels the other issue i had was finding which site offered the best price now i can search all the major travel sites at once with roadtriphelper
6434555 we try to list every hotel in the world in a free and honest manner and ensure everyone gets the lowest price by comparing over 30 major hotel providers at once
6434556 we are very excited to have chinook trading as our partner in canada their experience in leading the boot footwear category with major retailers in canada was critical in choosing chinook to be our partner they bring a wealth of successful experience in designing manufacturing and merchandising to our offering they are well regarded throughout canada and knowledgeable regarding the retail environment and consumers
6434557 weve seen a lot of new technologies over the years but so few ever live up to the hype we believe in this technology and its a natural fit for the categories we specialize in
6434558 we wanted to create a unit that would come in extremely handy for those people who love the outdoors like our popular phototrackr this unit is lightweight and easy to use but is built to withstand the adventures of your average hiker or outdoorsman its the perfect tool for your adventure quest
6434559 in 48 hours three ships have been attacked and hijacked by armed pirates it is coming to a very dangerous stage
6434560 we urge the united nations and the international community to take serious action to stop this menace
6434561 the calf was in much worse condition than they originally thought and the injuries were a lot worse than they thought as well probably from a shark attack
6434562 we have taken the hard decision to put it down unfortunately
6434563 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6434564 you said youd give us a 24 hour stay of execution
6434565 this is certainly not what we would have hoped we would have hoped that the animal would have been ok
6434566 we know what we need on a global level in terms of reductions
6434567 we cannot continue forever saying this is an issue for the industrial countries and no one else should do anything
6434568 unless we come with a spirit of cooperation trying to resolve things instead of making things more and more complicated
6434569 a lot of governments dont have positions yet and are going through internal processes where ideas are still festering
6434570 if you dont meet those basic criteria you are not going to achieve success
6434571 it wasnt as if we ran in with the sponsorship of the olympics wanted to make a quick buck then turn around and run back out
6434572 i wish i could say 10 years ago we saw this as a great vision but i think weve been doing great things for the last 20 years and this intersected really well for us
6434573 the olympics are great we love being connected to it but we dont want to tell olympic stories we want to tell our stories
6434574 whats happening in china is that stage has been raised so high it makes it easier for us to tell our stories louder with the world looking at whats going on here
6434575 the governor will discuss the logistic cooperation with the chinese company especially the security side
6434576 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
6434577 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
6434578 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
6434579 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesn
6434580 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
6434581 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
6434582 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the woman
6434583 when girls are married off at a young age they will be deprived of education and of enjoying their childhood
6434584 their bodies won s father told the associated press he will delay his son
6434585 from the point of view of a berry grower this is a great idea
6434586 there raspberries for example are so perishable that they need to be dealt as soon as they ripen t new buy the mobility is said brian noder project director of the vermont food venture center who designed the rolling freezer s unique desire to see this sort of on farm processing happening
6434587 i think once this thing starts being used people are going to be looking for it
6434588 we have plans to expand the vermont mystic pie with other kinds of berries
6434589 the constraint was being able to go from harvest to processor with berries from the field
6434590 it would be a very difficult thing to start a business in the preservation realm and build all your own infrastructure so this is really helpful
6434591 this initiative opens up possibilities for fraport as an airport operator and ground handling provider to apply its extensive know how actively and to help define standards within the framework of the cargo 2000 quality management system
6434592 producers of consumer products have an obligation to understand the short and long term effects of what they produce on people and on the environment our vision was to create products that are good for pooches people and the planet and we did so by deciding to manufacture in the us to ensure our products were green and of the highest quality
6434593 we wanted bath time to make for healthier dogs and happier people so we designed the line to evoke
6434594 pcos isnt just about your ovaries or your medical tests its about the whole of you mind body and spirit whether youre dealing with weight issues struggling with facial hair feeling frustrated with fertility or worrying about your increased risk of diabetes or heart disease theres little doubt that having pcos can prevent you from wholeheartedly embracing your life thats why we decided to write this book weve both got pcos ourselves and weve both used the information and ideas in this book to get our health and lives back on track
6434595 our entire site is dedicated to building healthy and strong families we believe 529 accounts are one of the best tools available to american families for managing the incredible costs of educating their kids
6434596 this all began when we saw how much quality time families were spending playing fantasy sports together building a site focused on family play and awarding money for college expenses was an obvious next step
6434597 to live boldly encompasses many things an invitation to act true to your nature to act in accord with your natural strengths absent that it is the vision to begin to act in accord with your inclination seeking out that thing you would like to be or face even when the natural ability or the courage isnt yet within your grasp living boldly is walking right into the thing you need at the moment and putting it on seeing how well you can make it fit
6434598 live boldly before yourself so you live through your day to that just before sleep moment where you offer yourself the certain approval today i have done my best thats when you get to present yourself a trophy a trophy for living boldly forward in your day living as if no one were looking
6434599 girlawhirl com is about a quick shot of information or idea thats relevant to a busy womans lifestyle
6434600 while weve always been cost conscious we never recommend handbags with super high price tags we still mix in a bit of the fantastical maybe an article here and there about shopping in a european city now were focusing on more information about contests readers can enter to win big and pulling forward all our usual information about web sales and discounts so its easier for readers to access

6434607 in the last 10 years or so we have seen a noticeable difference in the number of younger kids 8 and 9 years old playing travel ball
6434608 i guarantee you i spent 15 000 hotels gas food all kinds of things i miss sally s johnson a spokeswoman for the national council of youth sports said travel teams pulling in the best young players have helped create room for less skilled players in recreational leagues but they have also upset the mix between natural born shortstops and benchwarmers s been going on quite some time but it is getting younger and younger and i s good
6434609 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
6434610 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water
6434611 national forecasting of water availability has never been done because traditionally our use of the resource was thought to be unlimited
6434612 our lack of data places canada at strategic disadvantage for bilateral negotiations with the u s
6434613 this report is a one stop shop document that can guide us toward ensuring that we get clean safe water to canadians wherever they choose to live
6434614 the fact that theyre even taking this close a look at this issue is good news in my mind because theyve been away from the fresh water scene for so long
6434615 this house believes that we can solve our energy problems with existing technologies today without the need for breakthrough innovations

6434624 we can never be surprised at what vile evil comes from the mouth of a confessed victim of child abuse at the hands of her own parents
6434625 roseannes parents responded to the accusation by going on air and slating she is a psychopathic liar and her sister agreed
6434626 that gave us an insight into who she is and what she is capable of saying and doing

6434644 any time anybody does anything that in any way pulls this campaign down and says lets address reality and the problems were facing in this world youre accused of being racist so you have to shut up

6434658 this study demonstrates the potential for personalized medicine combining selection of patients with a specific type of genetic mutation and a drug treatment that has been specifically designed to overcome that mutation
6434659 the publication of these ground breaking results in the lancet offers new hope to those patients with cf due to a nonsense mutation in the cftr gene and establishes a path forward for evaluating the efficacy and long term safety of ptc124
6434660 we are very pleased by this positive outcome from our ongoing collaboration with ptc
6434661 the development of ptc124 fits well with our strategic goal of supporting approaches that have the potential to modify the course of cf we are continuing to work together with ptc and the broader cf medical community to support the next steps in the evaluation of ptc124 for the clinical benefit for the treatment of nonsense mutation cf
6434662 the publication of these data provides clinical proof of concept in cf for the ptc124 mechanism of action in overcoming nonsense mutations as the basis for treating genetic disease
6434663 based on these results we intend to initiate a phase 2b study later this year to evaluate the clinical benefit of ptc124 in adults and children with nonsense mutation mediated cf given the potential applicability of ptc124 to multiple genetic disorders we have a pivotal study of ptc124 for nonsense mutation duchenne becker muscular dystrophy ongoing and are planning proof of concept studies in additional genetic disorders

6434680 we have a childhood immunisation register that records immunisations for children up to age seven and the national hpv register will now go forward into adulthood for that particular immunisation
6434681 we must consider going even further with efficient and cost effective use of funds to establish a complete national whole of life register of all immunisations for all australians
6434682 there is real patient benefit in a properly administered register
6434683 it would be convenient for patients and doctors and ensure that patients were up to date and covered with immunisations as well as reducing unnecessary duplication of vaccinations
6434684 for example there is no national record of whos received mmr or hepatitis b shots at school and who might need to receive them later in life
6434685 for doctors a national whole of life register would provide total data to complement their patient records and for patients they would know that wherever and whenever in australia they have had an immunisation it would be recorded
6434686 this is an issue of considerable importance to the health of all australians and to the governments overall prevention agenda

6434807 the policy of placing a restraint on nelson while in a hospital bed is unequivocally related to a penological goal and is not constitutionally excessive
6434808 nelsons experience does not rise to the level of unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain

6434837 the obama campaign falsifying its fec disclosure reports by using a front company to disguise its relationship with acorn a controversial group
6434838 according to federal election commission fec financial disclosure reports filed by the campaign earlier this year between february 25th and may 17th obama paid 832 598 to citizens services inc
6434839 according to the fec in a situation where a campaign committee reports that they paid a company for services that the company says they do not provide there is reason to be suspicious it was irregular and it was inappropriate to wit in 1997 congresswoman mary rose oakar oh was prosecuted by the u s justice department for conspiracy to deceive the fec as to the true nature of the campaign contributions and expenditures that she was required to report falsifying federal disclosure reports is a serious matter and it is a crime if the fec chooses to exercise equal enforcement then senator obama could very well be subject to prosecution

6434875 over the next couple days whats kind of going to tell where im at in terms of my progress is the amount of swelling that is in there
6434876 and how quickly we can get it out of there is going to be how quickly i can get back on the field
6434877 when we got in here that was our goal to get better as an individual and as an offensive unit and weve done that were just better as an offense our communication understanding the system knowing their roles execution weve gotten better
6434878 we improved on a lot of things that we really wanted to focus on i thought we really got better as the weeks went on the good thing is that camp is just the start though we still have a couple of preseason games left and some more time to get ready for the regular season but we got off to a good start
6434879 we accomplished our installation on both sides of the ball and all of the things we wanted to get done we got done you just have to wait to see how the season goes
6434880 mainstream and multicultural youth services and raise the profile of multicultural youth issues in the act
6434881 i am glad that we are taking matters in our hands
6434882 students come to gaijindai to learn the skills that they think will help them fully integrate into japanese society of course however hard they strive becoming fluent speakers applying for permanent residency etcetera he pauses to chuckle softly they will never be allowed to vote
6434883 as a japanese i can say that the closest a gaijin can come to full japanese citizenship is to witness some newsworthy incident and then be interviewed about it by a tv news crew
6434884 almost all eyewitness accounts from non japanese end up on the cutting room floor and are never broadcast
6434885 on the board you will see written two eyewitness accounts of the same dramatic incident read them carefully and identify the key differences you have three minutes
6434886 because it sounds more articulate so id be more inclined to trust the witness
6434887 believe in sounds more than words the second is the better account the first is full of crafty turns of phrase if you are the eyewitness you will use the second pattern if you dont want to lead your miserable gaijin lives in eternal obscurity you will do as i say and use the onomatopoeia i teach you in this class
6434888 now imagine that the north korean threat was taken out not by machine gun fire but instead by a missile that was fired from the helicopter and exploded leaving only a crater where the infants once stood
6434889 herikoputaa kara misairu ga shu de tonde don de kakou shika nani mo nokottenai you ni bakuhatsu shita
6434890 listen shu is the sound my wife makes when she gets down on her knees in the shower like this
6434891 and she directs the spray at a little patch of mould like this shu shu shu shu there you go walk around on your knees and try it son
6434892 louder missed a bit stick out your arse a bit more you look nothing like my wife
6434893 a missile aimed at children goes pyuuu you maggot as for the explosion however don is the correct sound go back to your seat
6434894 now lets get rid of the missile this time the helicopter used a flamethrower which in japanese is kaenhoushaki repeat after me ka en hou sha ki to burn the north korean children alive i am a tv news reporter who has just arrived on the scene which of you can describe how the nation was dramatically saved
6434895 herikoputaa kara kaenhoushaki ga guoooo to shite kitachousen no kodomo ga bachi bachi ni yakikorosareta
6434896 it is not pashi i repeat not pashi a sound pashi i associate pashi with the sizzling pashi flesh pashi korean pashi kids
6434897 but the others are too defiant they dont understand that onomatopoeia is not an optional part of speech its a state of mind i have yet to devise effective means of erasing everything they know or think they know they are still using goddamn verbs
6434898 always check in the code even if it doesnt work or isnt finished youll still be able to change it later
6434899 perhaps what we need is a model of software accretion start with a tiny fragment of code that does almost nothing look on the bright side code that does nothing cant have many bugs test it and check it in add one more small feature test that feature and check it in add another small feature test that and check it in daily hourly even you always have functional software
6434900 perhaps what we need is a model of software accretion start with a tiny fragment of code that does almost nothing add one more small feature add another small feature
6434901 wouldnt have appointed antonin scalia and perhaps not john roberts though
6434902 as you know attorney general guidelines were first implemented in the wake of the fbi abuses of the 1960s and 1970s and serve as one of the most important bulwarks against future abuses
6434903 given the importance of these guidelines providing a period of time for public comment would be a reasonable and responsible way to move forward and achieve the best possible end result
6434904 the guidelines will require all activities to have a valid purpose
6434905 we are particularly concerned that the draft guidelines might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
6434906 we have serious questions about the scope of information sharing as it relates to u s persons who are under no suspicion of wrongdoing

6434918 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security
6434919 the democrats win when the republicans are split or when the ideology of the democrats is triumphant for unique historical reasons
6434920 de kosten bereikten een toppunt in maart en zijn sindsdien weer wat gedaald maar nog niet op het niveau van juli vorig jaar vraag is of dat niveau ooit opnieuw zal bereikt worden
6434921 als dit blijft duren is dat een zeer zwaar probleem voor de belgische economie door de automatische loonindexering neemt de concurrentiekracht af
6434922 de vraag naar nieuwe woningen daalt hetgeen een impact heeft op de woonkredieten

6434944 deze belastingmaatregel dreigt de concurrentiepositie van schiphol nadelig te be nvloeden
6434945 daarnaast houden we er ernstig rekening mee dat er als gevolg van de hoge kerosineprijzen en de wereldwijde verslechtering van het economische klimaat in 2009 opnieuw geen groei van het aantal passagiers zal zijn
6434946 de groei is nul voor 2008 en nul voor 2009
6434947 the success of our programs and activities in honduras depends on the efforts of our dedicated staff implementing partners and counterparts
6434948 usaid is sending one of its most talented leaders to honduras brands has the perfect combination of scholarship pragmatism and professional integrity that enables him to make difficult decisions in the interests of all concerned parties without being judgmental
6434949 im pretty confident from our sources that weve got the person that we want who weve been looking for
6434950 and with that being the case we will be standing here until he gets down to arraignment until he gets to the grand jury and until he goes to jail
6434951 what we got to do is make sure that predators like this guy are off the street
6434952 make no mistake about it when hes arrested when hes prosecuted and convicted we will ask for consecutive penalties he will be a very very old guy before the time he ever gets out of prison
6434953 there is a significant acs history in that household so detectives are conducting the investigation
6434954 there are three children in that household obviously the two and a half year old a one year old and a five year old
6434955 my sympathies are with the case workers and the judges who have to make those decisions every single day
6434956 and sometimes they turn out to be in retrospect i dont know if they made the wrong decision but in this case a tragedy took place and our prayers should be with a two year old who is dead
6434957 that kid is only two years old he dont have a life yet come on he cant even fight
6434958 he didnt have a chance what kind of chance did that little boy have at two years old
6434959 i have eight children of my own and i cant even imagine coming home to something like that
6434960 allen cappelli will fill an important vacancy on the mta board
6434961 allen will continue to be a strong voice not only for staten island but also for the eight million people who take new york public transportation each day i look forward to his confirmation
6434962 the pika is the american wests canary in the coal mine
6434963 as temperatures rise pika populations at lower elevations are being driven to extinction pushing pikas further upslope until they have nowhere left to go
6434964 climate change is likely to drive a third of the worlds species to extinction worse its the species living on mountaintops which until now have been free from human impact that will be hardest hit
6434965 the american pika is an obvious example of such a species at considerable risk from climate change
6434966 not in the purview of the commission or department to effect
6434967 the california fish and game commissions attempt to bury its head in the sand rather than deal with the impact of global warming on wildlife is an embarrassment to our state which is a leader in climate policy
6434968 the commission is not allowed to abdicate its duty to protect californias plants animals and wild habitats and neither is the u s fish and wildlife service
6434969 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6434970 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6434971 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6434972 the self can be broken and broken to pieces that if they can be reassembled can be reassembled into a completely different self
6434973 i know the public funding of avastin will come as a great relief to those nova scotians who want the drug for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer
6434974 by funding avastin we are offering people another option for coping with this cancer
6434975 this tool is a critical first step in helping hospitals evaluate their disaster plans to find out what works and what doesnt
6434976 that knowledge can help hospitals make important changes to their response plans now before a disaster strikes
6434977 in the hal lab we work with a range of athletes and sports people to measure and record the dynamic data as the foot moves across a special computerised plate like a doormat on the floor
6434978 gathering and analysing the moving foot data of rowers presented an extra challenge for us
6434979 the data was then analysed and the results discussed with each rower and their support team so that they could make adjustments to the foot beds of their shoes to enable them to get optimum force distribution and magnitude when rowing
6434980 this system gave gb rowing something they didnt have before they were able to quantify the equality of the force each rower was producing and the quality of the force is intrinsic to their speed and success this information can also help to protect athletes against lower limb injury for example if the foot is rolling in it will affect the knees
6434981 the dynamic insoles retrain the way the foot functions once the athletes start wearing the insoles this helps to retrain the way they load the weight in the foot over time this helps to relieve symptoms caused by uneven foot pressure and muscle misalignment and can help to prevent further injuries the technology is not unique but our expertise in interpreting the data is crucial to making this technology useful to the athletes
6434982 in the past we used to make insoles by hand from a plaster cast of the foot but this new software gives us much more information because we know how the foot is being used in motion and how the pressure is being loaded this enables us to design a much more accurate insole using the computer software
6434983 the stock photo market in our region is currently ruled by classic international stock agencies that customarily offer images at elevated prices the awareness of the various micro stock agencies and photo shopping options is limited among czech and slovak internet users
6434984 we will prepare comprehensive instructions in the czech language for those czech and slovak photographers interested in uploading their photos to make them available for sale on dreamstime
6434985 many of our customers are coming from emergent markets such as the czech republic and their interest in both purchases and submissions buyers and contributors is increasing at a healthy rate making images available to the czech and slovak users at a price they can afford is just good business
6434986 basically its almost like over the gates of hell abandon hope all ye who enter
6434987 most of these people like things that go bang pop sput fizz
6434988 i think its great that weve got the enthusiasm of a lot of people its impressive but i dont want anyone to get hurt
6434989 many people have a knee jerk reaction that if youve got anything nuclear youre a possible terrorist

6434992 you can never tell where the sparks of innovation are going to come
6434993 we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counterproductive

6434997 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6434998 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6434999 anyone who spent time this summer in the strafford pond should be alert for symptoms such as high fever muscle aches severe headache chills red eyes and vomiting
6435000 call your doctor right away if you experience any of these symptoms or jaundice abdominal pain diarrhea or rash
6435001 after they realised we werent from home amp away there was this dead silence
6435002 the crickets were chirping and i think i could hear a crow in background so they ushered us up the red carpet and on to a podium to have our picture taken
6435003 then a security guard came up to me and the other female cast member and said can we get the girlfriends out of the shot we were like were actually in the show but thank you for validating our presence and our sense of equality in the comedy industry
6435004 i was like adams the nicest guy in the world of course hes going to say that then his producer called the following week theyve had me on five times this year
6435005 were nurturing new talent and getting good radio out of it abc tv is on board theyre basically looking for formats they can develop into television series the 10 episodes were making now are pilots but im delighted with it and id like it to continue
6435006 shows like little britain and the league of gentlemen started as radio shows and then went to tv
6435007 i thought the way i grew up was normal until i started comparing myself to other people
6435008 instead of giving us umbrellas for example mum would cut arm holes in a garbage bag we were only allowed to watch half an hour of tv a day until i reached the age of 10 i had to be in bed by 6pm when it was daylight savings the f ing sun would still be shining
6435009 if that was true my job would be done the jokes would write themselves id just sit back and put my hand out for the cash

6435012 its not about everybody driving a subcompact going forward but it is better fuel economy some sort of change in the design of the vehicle itself in order to get some of the weight out and not carrying around a lot of excess vehicle that you dont need in a marketplace that is just going to be a little more price sensitive
6435013 i think its probably true that people have particularly in the u s experienced enough of a shock from the sudden rise in gas prices that theyre not going to go back to quite the same kind of product that they were driving previously

6435022 todays announcement represents our commitment to maintaining and growing our leadership position in the calgary market
6435023 with this investment we are demonstrating to our customers that we can grow along with them for the foreseeable future
6435024 we are very excited about having hochschild as our new partner in the liam joint venture
6435025 hochschild is a world class precious metals mining company and brings a wide range of strategic benefits to the liam project they currently operate four gold silver mines in close proximity to liam at arcata selene and pallancata and have successfully operated in southern peru for many years
6435026 there should be no bar on the kumaris from going to school as there are no historical and religious documents restricting kumaris from enjoying child rights
6435027 as soft and clear as a ducks the body of a banyan tree and the chest of a lion
6435028 made a commitment to jesus that is still important to them today
6435029 there are some very significant and i believe unintended consequences of the mechanism the government proposes
6435030 the reductions in emissions that are being asked of the electricity generation sector are a huge ask if that sector is to make the transition and keep the lights on
6435031 if you go beyond a certain level youll just achieve your extra abatement at the cost of sending industry offshore
6435032 and if theyre prepared to be that irresponsible with australian childrens future then perhaps they dont deserve to operate here
6435033 the governments got to hold its course its got to resist these calls that seek to handball the responsibility onto others than the big polluters
6435034 weve got to understand there is not a bottomless pit of money here we will take responsible decisions in the national interest
6435035 we have to be very conscious that any decision to shield one sector or increase the protection to one sector will inevitably place greater costs on other parts of the community and on other parts of the economy
6435036 i understand because you are a casual worker they can dismiss you when they want but the main thing is the way they went about it
6435037 the rudd government is committed to ensuring that university students have access to vital campus services including child care health care counselling and sporting facilities
6435038 the government is currently considering options we are not considering a return to compulsory student union fees
6435039 open to proposals that would see a restoration of viable campus services
6435040 what were seeing are real concerns that universities have lost some of their soul through vsu it has really gutted services
6435041 a university is far more than an academic institution otherwise wed do it over the internet if you live in a town you pay your rates you cant opt out and say you dont want to pay for the cricket pitch
6435042 vending machine campuses where the only services are machines you put money in and a can of coke comes out
6435043 if people cant park in the street it turns them away from stopping altogether and therefore people will start to go to the bigger shopping centres and strip shopping will die
6435044 there is certainly scope to help speed up trams along sydney road which crawl like snails at peak times
6435045 the media should accept some responsibility for the current state of foi
6435046 the extensive use of foi editors has contributed significantly to the current impasse by flooding government with deliberate fishing expeditions and requests designed specifically to embarrass ministers
6435047 id like to see more sensible and less sensationalised reporting of the information released within an accurate context
6435048 the media reported that four key departments had recommended against the governments policy the reported implication being that the government had acted foolishly against the advice of the public service and that there was disconnect between the new government and its public service advisers
6435049 with you in charge of business i can relax ni ban shi wo fang xin
6435050 without him it would have been much more difficult to get rid of them gang of four so his contribution was huge
6435051 a clear message to the community that ignoring your fines does not make them go away
6435052 theyve been marginally successful for us the percentage we were recovering two years ago was 40 now its up to 53
6435053 i think were still in a situation where were not recovering enough its a large amount of money were writing off
6435054 we could certainly run a few more child care centres
6435055 the amount owing to the city of port phillip is decreasing mostly because the infringements court is writing off more fines because five years has elapsed
6435056 for those of you that are voluntary workers as part of the liberal cause i want to say to you that more than ever australia needs good government
6435057 more than ever we need you to be a part of the comeback of the liberal party at a federal level
6435058 theres only one thing you can do and thats pick yourself up start explaining the issues start talking about the future
6435059 was not a tax resident of any country and therefore the payment was free of tax
6435060 an investigation of national and international significance into allegations of tax fraud and money laundering
6435061 the issue is the steps taken by p hogan with the assistance of a3 mr stewart to misrepresent his tax residency status to authorities in australia and the united states for the purpose of avoiding liability to taxation
6435062 ignores the legitimacy of the tax planning involved in any international travel by hogan
6435063 the last thing we want is that the whale should suffer the vets are saying he hasnt got long to go you should take action
6435064 the figures show we need to bridge that gap there are solutions which governments could work towards for example in rural areas where the population is big enough there could be rural cancer centres to give people access to the services they need
6435065 we expect the market to soften further from this month onwards
6435066 it was a little bit sloppy when you hit that 20th or 21st practice its always the time of the year when youre tired of hitting each other and want to go play but weve still got some things to do
6435067 but then you look back and everybody got hurt during non contact drills i probably think about it more at night but when i come to work hey get the next guy ready get the ship ready to sail
6435068 er is een wildgroei aan voorstellen om bepaalde kosten fiscaal aftrekbaar te maken hiervan wordt alleen de belastingbrief dikker de burger slaagt er nu al niet meer in zelf zijn belastingbrief in te vullen
6435069 het is beter deze verzekeringstaksen te herzien diverse wetsvoorstellen liggen hier reeds in het parlement
6435070 ive made it very clear that i expect the banks to pass on official rate cuts
6435071 we will pass on any reduction in the reserve banks cash rate to anzs variable home loan rates as funding costs allow
6435072 this research suggests that while one farmer might get 100 megalitres through his wheel his neighbour could receive almost 118 megalitres each and every year thats around 40 000 of permanent entitlement highlighting the inequity that can arise from inaccurate measurement
6435073 the voluntary redundancies are occurring at a time when there is a staff shortage and now they are going to implement a forced process
6435074 the most recent round of voluntary departures did not fully resolve the deficit problem
6435075 we thought it was a dummy and we went and had a look and it looked to us like it was a little boy
6435076 it may have been snagged it may have been under water and with the recent rain has just been brought to the surface
6435077 we hope that his soul will rest in peace thats the best thing we can wish for
6435078 dimmeys is of historical significance as an example of the many large department stores built in the suburbs of melbourne during the pre world war i retail boom following the 1890s depression
6435079 its changing status from a once fashionable department store to a prominent bargain store reflects the changing fortunes of melbournes inner suburbs during the 20th century
6435080 im surprised it hasnt been nominated already it certainly deserves to be this place is a bit like the clocks at flinders street station and you can see the tower from all over richmond
6435081 if the government wants to help they should try to reduce the price of fresh vegetables and put a tax on junk food chicken breasts can be as much as 15 a kilo and broccoli 5 a kilo but junk food is so cheap it makes it really hard
6435082 keeping in view the sacrifice of former prime minister benazir bhutto for democracy the office of the president is the right of asif ali zardari
6435083 researchers have speculated that tumours give off different odours but were the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved
6435084 this research opens doors to potential new approaches to skin cancer diagnosis based on the profile of skin odours hopefully leading to more rapid and non invasive detection and diagnosis
6435085 our skin releases many different chemicals and their levels depend on many factors including the area of the body and the age of the person factors that would make developing a national skin cancer screen based on detecting them extremely difficult
6435086 i would have hoped that a station broadcasting programs which describe jews as the offspring of apes and pigs and which advocates their annihilation would not receive the support of australias arabic community
6435087 we need to make a clear distinction between anti israel and anti semitic and between a terrorist organisation and a resistance group
6435088 that resulted in the release of 500 prisoners rotting in israeli jails israel understands only the language of force an occupier cannot claim self defence

6435093 the corporate and structured finance division will also be gradually wound down
6435094 other assets and businesses not within the key areas of focus will be kept under review and divested or wound down as appropriate to maximise shareholder value
6435095 for our shareholders we would like to think that some of the measures today and the clear direction we are taking should be the first step down the path of restoring some confidence
6435096 the volatile global market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult
6435097 we believe that the changes to the business will better equip babcock amp brown to operate in the current market environment to build on its leading position in its key markets and position itself for ongoing earnings growth in future years
6435098 the pace of change in that business is really gathering some momentum
6435099 we are not going to ratchet up our earnings from coles as may have been done in the past by playing the margin lever either with suppliers or customers
6435100 while supermarkets and bunnings were 8 below expectations coal was 20 ahead
6435101 reductions in interest rates will be positive but not overly positive

6435103 there are businesses out there with good positions that cannot afford to fund them and we would like to help them
6435104 items recorded through the statutory profit line have no impact on our net operating profit dividend and underlying cash flow
6435105 what we tend to do at distressed times is not offer expensive lots for sale we remix small lots and lower entry points that tends to protect the value of the land management deals we have
6435106 weve told the market for two odd years that were a developer of roads
6435107 it makes good sense to see what value we can crystallise in an economy thats doing really well
6435108 we have not arranged any retail cdo issuance in the last three years
6435109 a range of investors out there are scared because these acronyms have either burnt them or burnt others
6435110 the owners of these things are selling both the high quality and low quality
6435111 so much for the drought in the bush regional publications is now fairfaxs largest new division
6435112 if we had done nothing somebody else would have been holding this press conference today ive got no doubt about that
6435113 i look at fairfax as what it is today not what it was and what rural press used to be
6435114 clearly with 8 2 per share earnings growth notwithstanding the dilution and the extra debt the answer is yes
6435115 conditions have tightened in the general economy and consistent with those conditions advertising markets have slowed in this new financial year and we dont have much visibility at all on what we think the advertising markets will do between now and the half or into the new calendar year
6435116 the uncertainties about the value of the a and other currencies rising raw materials costs oil prices and global economic conditions
6435117 we have this major brownfield expansion program going on so that will give us significant growth in the next few years
6435118 we want to be fairly aggressive in our acquisitions there because we have to get critical mass into that business
6435119 we have had a good start to full year 2009 with the hospitals experiencing strong demand and the pathology group building on the significant growth of the second half of full year 2008
6435120 it is not expected that the changes to the medicare surcharge levy threshold level announced in the federal budget will impact earnings in the next period with underlying volume growth in hospitals remaining strong and health fund agreements in place with most major health funds for terms to run varying from one to three years
6435121 the bottom line result is that new migrants provide a substantial contribution to the commonwealth government budget initially and this contribution grows substantially over time in real terms
6435122 if terria wins the bid the very first thing ill be doing is contacting telstra chairman donald mcgauchie and telstra chief executive sol trujillo and offering them a substantial equity stake in the network company
6435123 i think it really is important that the network company not only operate in the interests of everyone but be seen to be operating in the interests of everyone
6435124 clearly these results are not where we would like them to be
6435125 merchant profits came under pressure in the second half particularly in the weak us and uk markets

6435133 qantas has maintained its 3 wages policy but changes to our classification structure ensures every member obtained increased remuneration of between 4 and 5 8 per annum
6435134 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6435135 every time we put something in on offense it might look good for a day or two then the defense counters then weve got to counter that believe me we got them on a couple things today theyll go back over there tonight and try to counter that
6435136 because probably he lived a relatively frugal life there isnt a great deal of cook material directly attributed to him around the place
6435137 we are not in the business of pursuing that kind of material
6435138 the cartoonists job is to criticise historically cartoons began as a means of criticising royalty and abuses of power perhaps it was thought to be harder to take them to court than someone who had criticised with the written word
6435139 i have always been impressed by the depth of his thinking his satire is very funny but never derisive his line is subtle and original no one does it like him

6435142 microsoft has benefitted enormously from its novell deal and to be honest so has the linux community
6435143 theres a lot of linux out there much more than microsoft generally signals publicly and their customers are using it so its important that microsoft have a good interoperability story on that front linking up with a linux vendor is a good way to do that
6435144 it wants to sabotage free software while at the same time keeping those pesky regulators off its back
6435145 people that use red hat at least with respect to our intellectual property in a sense have an obligation to compensate us
6435146 we believe every linux customer basically has an undisclosed balance sheet liability
6435147 mr conductor is a lot harder then last year but it was fun
6435148 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
6435149 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
6435150 the blood of christ is sufficient to atone for as many worlds of sinners as there are sinners in the world
6435151 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
6435152 we are not pulling out and pulling back troops behind this administrative border into the territory of south ossetia
6435153 its a neighborhood electric vehicle we discovered that practically all that we need in our life shopping work medical is within seven miles of the house thats what we use the electric car for
6435154 you can charge the car anywhere there is a place to plug in
6435155 when stopped youd almost swear the car was off i just listen to birds chirp
6435156 after the footy finals but before the melbourne arts festival
6435157 i can only vaguely remember being lifted on to a lorry with my child when i came to we were in tbilisi
6435158 my husband is lying there killed left to be eaten by dogs
6435159 my husbands sister was burnt alive ossetian fighters made her set her own house on fire then they pushed her in there and locked the door behind her
6435160 i phoned my ossetian neighbours asking them to bury my husband they said they had tried but the fighters threatened to kill anyone who would try to bury a georgian ive been haunted by nightmares i cant carry on living
6435161 my village took the hardest hit they bombed and fired at it from all sides in the morning after the attack on our village stopped we got out of our cellar and fled
6435162 she had to leave her old father behind she doesnt know what happened to him the village was destroyed and plundered and lots of its residents were killed
6435163 if youd met my father you would know that he was an absolutely harmless person he did not deserve a death like that
6435164 and he cried so much when i was leaving how can i ever forget his eyes
6435165 today i was told that they were killed but the person who told me this does not know them personally he isnt certain its not reliable information its a rumour i dont believe it i dont want to believe it i will go on looking for them
6435166 we left the house we left everything and came on foot because to stay there was impossible
6435167 they are burning the houses from most of the houses they are taking everything they are stealing everything even such things as toothbrushes and toilets they are taking the toilets imagine they are taking broken refrigerators
6435168 we are so heartbroken i dont know what to say or even think our whole lives we were working to save something and one day we lost everything now i have to start everything from the very beginning
6435169 breaking the rules sublime beats ridiculous energy you know how we do
6435170 theres a lot of logistical as well as aesthetic considerations if there is a large ape that starts climbing the empire state building it might get in his way
6435171 americans look at it as though it says c which i dont even think of
6435172 i love sinead oconnors song fire on babylon it starts with germaine speaking about women and politics
6435173 we believe there is a bigger role for gas in providing australias baseload electricity needs as the economy transitions to a lower carbon emissions footprint
6435174 while gas fired power is substantially cleaner than brown coal its unclear whether this project is going to replace coal fired power or merely add to existing electricity generation and therefore increase our emissions
6435175 even if these two full time jobs dont come through he will be starting with job b next week
6435176 enough already angelo has a job and could have three we dont need to move to that state

6435186 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
6435187 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
6435188 a lot of campuses feel like theyve made really good progress at the campus level of developing plans
6435189 but theres more of a challenge at the regional and state level
6435190 no civilization can survive the physical destruction of its resource base
6435191 the second law of thermodynamics trumps the laws of economics
6435192 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it
6435193 if kindness and comfort are as i suspect the results of an energy surplus then as the supply contracts we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack
6435194 one of our central tasks is the creation of the post oil megacity
6435195 competitive markets that provide strong incentives to innovate combined with a regulatory environment for doing business that readily allows them to do so
6435196 for much of the innovation that needs to take place in australian firms there is no market failure that needs addressing or can sensibly be addressed once governments regulatory failures have been rectified
6435197 pocketed the money hoodwinked the government and had a free lunch
6435198 the implicit industry assistance stemming from such policies may in the future dominate other measures of business support
6435199 even by the the high previous benchmark for industry support this really is real money
6435200 it is not fair that the people of the latin american community cannot leave its houses neither to do plans by the fear of to be bothered by police officers and agents of immigration
6435201 we may later choose to expose the linux platform fully enabling others to add widgets and other extras
6435202 we know that when students feel connected they are more likely to be successful academically socially and personally
6435203 we hope these programs give students an opportunity to make connections
6435204 the new line up of events will help freshmen to know right away what it means to be purple
6435205 they will have a sense of institutional pride they will feel connected and they will have fun
6435206 new students get the very basic information they need at plan it purple
6435207 in the past they would get lots of information thrown at them that they werent able to process and that they forgot by the time classes began we expanded orientation now so that new students get the information they need when its most useful for them
6435208 this years freshman class will get to launch a new warhawk tradition and pave the way for every future freshman class to experience in years to follow this class will be welcomed to uw whitewater like never before and will have a chance to leave their mark on our campus in a new and exciting way
6435209 at plan it purple students received only the basic information they needed at that time
6435210 the podcasts helped fill in the gaps and gave students the next set of information they needed prior to move in and club u dub dub
6435211 it is our goal that students will leave their club u dub dub experience more energized more informed and more committed to the university of wisconsin whitewater and their status as a warhawk

6435230 no that is not true we have not pulled out of the champions trophy but we have advised the icc about our considerable concern and we have made sure that they understand that we will not go anywhere which is not safe we are waiting to hear from them later this evening

6435232 we are very willing to tour pakistan we are very keen to do so and we will visit pakistan as long as the safety and security advisors say that it is safe

6435280 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6435281 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6435282 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6435283 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6435284 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6435285 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6435286 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6435287 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6435288 we are making progress together in the defeat of iraqs enemies of all stripes
6435289 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6435290 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6435291 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6435292 and as we said from the begininng there is no hidden agenda here
6435293 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6435294 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6435295 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6435296 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6435297 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6435298 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6435299 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in

6435366 we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counterproductive
6435367 we urge the federal government to fully respect the well founded principles of conscientious objection
6435368 im constantly looking for innovation during the olympic games i felt that i could not see critical parts of the game well enough from outside the field in order to give advice about how to play corners we used to analyse video fragments after the game but for me this was too late i wanted it realtime after some unsuccessful trials with a laptop that was connected to the tv camera with a long cable i came up with the idea of video classes these are a set of glasses with little screens in it on which i see all the tv cameras capture i got in touch with some engineers and some months later i could test the first prototype from then on i could give much more detailed advice to my players there are three important things to mention when working with innovations id like to share with you innovation must always serve a purpose ive been tempted many times to innovate for the sake of innovation which does not lead to an improvement there must be a clear challenge innovation has to solve each innovation has growing pains dont expect it to work the first time it needs tweaking and tuning until it gives you the competitive advantage you want innovation causes resistance everything thats new frightens people this fact has two implications first when you encounter resistance you probably found a real innovation so be proud of yourself second find a way to deal with resistance dont expect others to embrace your novelty give the others time to adapt and get used to it
6435369 our training program included many 30 meter sprints the team excessively had to train this because for ages it is common practice to train 30 meter sprints then i had this idea to analyse the running pattern during a game in order to achieve that we equipped each player with a gps for some training sessions analysis of the data showed that on averag e a player performs 15 meter sprints rather than 30 meter ones due to that we were able to make our training plan better match our real needs another small improvement was born
6435370 before the start of a game i thought it was a good idea to motivate the team with phrases like we really need to win otherwise were out the effect was rather the contrary it did not help them to perform better initially i was wondering why now i know the problem is that the individual player has no chance to influence the outcome of the game by himself even though she does his very best there are too many other factors she cannot control and which can be decisive for the outcome this lack of control made them tensed and nervous hindering them to function optimally i realized that winning or losing is merely the result of the way we play the good news is that each individual player can influence the way she plays so instead of talking about winning or losing before a game we carefully repeat our strategy before a game as well as the personal things each player has to pay attention to thats concrete and much better controllable through this approach they are much more relaxed and in a condition to bring the very best out of them our results proved that
6435371 in hockey there are 38 ways how corner can be played during a match i instruct my team how it has to play it in order to do that i developed a sophisticated body sign language all players had to learn by heart the problem was that the competition recorded and analysed this language and finally decoded it consequently they knew what i was up to and my competitive advantage was under pressure coincidentally i was invited to join the dutch cycle team during the tour de france by chance i discovered that they used radio sets to stay in touch with the cyclists i thought wow if we had this i could regain my competitive advantage at once when i returned home i secretly studied the rules where nothing about radio communication was mentioned therefore i correctly assumed that it must be allowed i got in touch with a company that produces radio sets in the size of an earplug since the ones cyclists use are too bulky after some adjustments the first prototype was operational the beautiful thing was that we kept our innovation top secret and continued using the body sign language in order to confuse the competition for 1 5 years we were able to stay undetected and fool the competition before they found out
6435372 from a financial perspective it is madness to become a hockey player they are paid a scholarship which is hardly enough to survive in spite of the dire financial reality applicants wait in queues to join the notion that they can win and be part of that winning team which gets media coverage all over the world is much more powerful than money or whatsoever

6435384 we are left without a shadow of doubt that anand who was a key player was interfering or at least tending to interfere in the due course of judicial proceedings the unshakable truth is that anand is guilty of criminal contempt of court both anand and khan have not tendered any apology

6435438 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis such as the elderly pregnant women and those with weak immune systems to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6435439 i have also asked all public health units to advise emergency rooms in their jurisdictions to be on alert for cases
6435440 we have taken a much broader approach to the recall than the actual testing has indicated we need to

6435443 food thats contaminated with listeria doesnt always look like its spoiled and the bacteria can also proliferate when its in the fridge
6435444 so its important for individuals to make sure they heat their food especially cold cuts and deli meats properly
6435445 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
6435446 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

6435448 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
6435449 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
6435450 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
6435451 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
6435452 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
6435453 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
6435454 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
6435455 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
6435456 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
6435457 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
6435458 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

6435553 there have been some subtle changes in the signage that should make it faster to get into the parking lots and ease some of the frustration
6435554 weve never had flaggers on the highway at the south end of inner springer loop
6435555 they forgot where they parked or said they were in the red parking lot when they were actually in the purple in all my years i have had one that was stolen they just get flustered or they arrive in the daylight and leave in the dark

6435557 they have to get their fertilizer and seed from the lower 48 too
6435558 we want the verdict as far this side of election day as possible
6435559 because i wanted alaskans to have a first hand opportunity to learn the facts of this matter
6435560 i understand the courts decision today and continue to have every faith in the fairness of the american judicial system and the courts commitment to conduct a speedy trial
6435561 i welcome the opportunity to demonstrate that i am innocent of these changes

6435563 this court went to great lengths i emphasize great lengths to rearrange its calendar
6435564 this is a proper venue for the crimes charged in the indictment
6435565 these forms are very important they serve a very important public function
6435566 i think its about some forms and some statements made in the district of columbia
6435567 so far thank god thats not a crime in america

6435739 we can certainly strengthen certain programmes in areas where unmik may be less present because of its own reconfiguration but this is always in the context where unmik will retain a presence in the field we will retain offices in pec gracanica and strpce and obviously we will be present in mitrovica
6435740 the reconfiguration of unmik is something on which weve been spending much time it will not result in us abandoning anybody
6435741 i think that it is important for kosovo it is important for the communities to have functional community policing that is multiethnic that reflects also the ethnic proportions on the ground
6435742 we really hadnt started talking about this issue with belgrade even though it is my conviction to have fully functioning customs it will be very important to have the co operation of belgrade on that
6435743 it is my view that belgrade has an interest in stopping smuggling in that area in ensuring proper controls
6435744 i want to avoid situations where i create a problem rather than solving one so i want to talk to all of those who may have a role in facilitating the implementation of this decision prepare for it and then move forward

6435758 i thought the audience walked out on the high film frame rate because it was too realistic now youre saying they cant tell the difference must have been an audience of supermen eh

6435762 another movie he directed brainstorm was originally designed to highlight a projection technology he was promoting the movie was about recording experiences in the film the recorded experiences were going to be played at 48 frames per second as opposed to the standard 24 frames per second his feeling was that audiences had gotten used to the look of standard film people were subliminally aware of the 24 frame per second flicker by projecting the film at twice the standard rate the flicker was harder to perceive and the film would be given that much more immediacy however it was impossible to convince the theater owners to install the special projectors to show the recorded experience sequences the movie was released as a conventional film fortunately the story stood up well on its own partly correct showscan runs at 60fps when he was doing test work for 2001 i believe it was on the spacewalk footage but its been years since i read up on the process and things have blurred for me he accidentally ran a sequence at 60fps and the uniform reaction in the booth was shock that hed gotten a 3d effect with a conventional camera he did dream up brainstorm to use the process but the studio hed been working with didnt want to install the only projector on the market that would run 60fps for an extended period without breaking for just one film and he ended up taking the story idea with him to mgm as i remember it he had to do a sizable payout to get it from his previous studio even then mgm wouldnt go for it compare and contrast with the ua chain which installed a highly sophisticated 3d system in a number of their theaters including seattle and ended up offering a couple of million dollars as a bounty to get someone anyone to shoot a feature using it there were several showscan shorts shot the one at expo 86 the one on magic tricks starring christopher lee and it looked like hed finally get them in widespread distribution when he signed a deal with a major restaurant chain to add a showscan theater to each of their restaurants but the chain was chuck e cheese and the deal was about two months before they imploded of all the reviews i read about the process the one that stuck with me was the one in cinefantastique that said makeup technology was going to have to improve greatly if the process was going to catch on you could apparently see every pore on christopher lees face

6435803 no one is beyond redemption even long seated hatret can be overcome
6435804 its a story about the beauty of life even when it seems mundane it shows us that the things for which we should be most grateful are often the things we overlook
6435805 the gritty reality of the hatred and prejudices that can live in all of us and defuses our preconceived notions by humanizing everyone involved
6435806 good people must carry the spark of human kindness even when all around is dark
6435807 gives us a look at what makes us human we are more than the sum of our parts
6435808 any of us can change even when weve spent our entire lives being selfish
6435809 one would assume we would have to help them rebuild because they are a partner in the war on terror theyve been helpful they are going to ask us i am sure to replace and rebuild
6435810 i think that assistance is probably going to happen its a matter of how much and how fast
6435811 my intent here is to understand better and find out how we can be more helpful if thats needed
6435812 we need to take a look at the strategic picture now and we need nato the european union to discuss that fact that many assumptions we have made may have changed and we need to take a hard look at this new reality
6435813 the only question is is the finished product when it comes to market substantially similar to the original drawing
6435814 you have to judge this not from the standpoint of a professional doll sculptor but from the standpoint of a child thats the law
6435815 the evidence is uncontroverted that the drawings portray older edgier sexier dolls
6435816 the eyebrows were way too aggressive the lips way too pronounced the face way too harsh what mga made is a prettier doll that could compete
6435817 can you see a parent saying to their child why do you want that you have a substantially similar doll back home
6435818 something else is going on besides mattels property in contributing to sales
6435819 an appropriate and proportionate tactical option to bring the matter to a safe conclusion
6435820 bottom line is that there is enough evidence to warrant a bullish bias against 1 4631 resistance a few days out is 1 4980 former resistance 1 5080 former resistance and 1 5170 38 2 fibonacci

6435826 la divisi n interna est debilitando a los negociadores palestinos
6435827 la nica opci n que tenemos ahora para salir de la crisis es iniciar un di logo completo que tenga como objetivo acabar con la divisi n y resolver todos los asuntos internos

6435832 asegura daniel nieto quien compar el caso de chiclana con el de estepona
6435833 estar amos ante un esc ndalo pol tico por una presunta prevaricaci n por omisi n y donde estimamos que el ayuntamiento habr a dejado de ingresar en torno a cien millones de euros las treinta mil viviendas ilegales son consecuencia de este pr ctica perversa en la disciplina urban stica de chiclana
6435834 el psoe sab a que dando la informaci n que el pp ped a se iba a poner de manifiesto cual era la responsabilidad del propio psoe y del gobierno local en la pol tica urban stica de chiclana que iba a tener consecuencias pol ticas y jur dicas e intent evitarlo por todos los medios

6435839 the illegal recruitment and trafficking of filipino women to malaysia is fast becoming a thriving enterprise and we call on the malaysian and philippine governments to forge a bilateral pact against human trafficking
6435840 with mere p3 000 the recruiter turns a blind eye on whatever fate awaits the recruit bound for malaysia
6435841 the recruitment is now done door to door in both urban and rural areas and the only way to stop this is through active public vigilance leading to higher arrest and conviction rates
6435842 we must fight as one country against human traffickers who deploy our women as modern slaves not only to malaysia but to nearly every nook and corner of the globe
6435843 they should put their eyes out so they cant commit any more crimes
6435844 prison isnt a solution anymore they just form their own gangs inside prison and come out stronger
6435845 one issue everyone has been afraid to touch is land use
6435846 everyone understands about using alternative fuel but land use has been the third rail ab 32 changed the equation because now land use has to be part of the solution to global warming you cant meet our goal just with alternative fuels you have to reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled
6435847 if people are going to drive and they are going to drive we need to plan in ways to get them out of their cars faster that means shrinking not the amount of housing not economic development not growth but shrinking the footprint on which that growth occurs

6435859 the upcoming debate in congress will allow the truth to come out that offshore drilling wont lower gas prices today tomorrow or a even a decade from now and will simply benefit big oils bottom line instead of helping hardworking americans
6435860 the new legislation that speaker pelosi has outlined includes crucial clean energy solutions and other important measures that will make america more energy independent offer consumers relief at the pump and will force drilling supporters to admit whether they really want to move america forward or simply want to continue helping the oil companies

6435877 in terms of our stadium construction programme our deadline for the confederations cup venues is december 2008 those stadiums are there and they are being upgraded

6435879 for the rest of the stadiums the completion date is october 2009 eighty percent of those stadiums will be completed by july 2009
6435880 therefore it is very important that we succeed in this world cup because nothing less is required to open the door for the last major event on the continent the olympics
6435881 it is about nation building its about infrastructure improvement for us its about country branding its about repositioning its about improving the image of our country and its about tourism promotion

6435883 the staging of the event on african soil presents us with an enormous opportunity to showcase our country and our continent i want to assure and reassure all of you present today that we are on track to host one of the best and most successful world cups of soccer ever held
6435884 our overarching goal is to host an incredible event on our continent that will be the envy of all the eyes of the world are already on us but the stare will intensify right after the olympics in beijing are over
6435885 we at fifa are working very hard with south africa to ensure that the world cup will happen in south africa if we say the world cup will take place in south africa it will take place in south africa
6435886 we are on the right timing the right track to ensure that all goes according to plan
6435887 when you look at the infrastructure preparations for the world cup its about building facilities for sports for instance the south african government for that infrastructure is spending close to r33 billion
6435888 but over and above that within that amount we are spending about r13 billion on transportation that is about extending the capacity of south africa to move people any economist will tell you that any countrys economic viability relies heavily on its ability to move people and good

6435936 this is a proper intellectual property ip court that has made this judgement
6435937 the previous ones were default judgements where defendants never turned up
6435938 i do not get any sense that theres been any fundamental shift in the desire to litigate
6435939 an open court process with a full report is certainly preferable to justice of the type being mooted by the government on p2p where activity takes place behind closed doors through industry action
6435940 i had just experienced a couple of weeks where i had seen some of my friends and acquaintances blow huge opportunities for themselves
6435941 why is it so tricky sometimes even difficult to realize how great of an opportunity you have and to jump on it to knock it out of the park
6435942 i truly believe we all ultimately determine how good our quality of life is everyone has past issues that they can use as a crutch if they choose to
6435943 i see people screw up quite often when they become comfortable and or complacent with where theyre at in life people usually dont realize how good theyve got it until its gone

6435961 it is within our mandate to give support we must get to work to offer assistance to our brothers and sisters
6435962 we are waiting for help from the chadian government fortunately we had already evacuated our women and children
6435963 we do not have any exact data but deaths appear to be on the rise in 2007 there were fewer uxo deaths we can assume that in all the places where there has been intensive fighting this year including the june battles between rebels and government soldiers in eastern chad there must be left over shells or unexploded ordinance of some kind

6435972 so far this year humanitarian organisations have heavily concentrated on purely life saving aspects of the response such as food security for refugees and internally displaced people
6435973 this money enables us to make sure people not only survive but they can start to live lives that are as normal and dignified as possible education and protection are essential to this
6435974 over a third of this was carried over from the 2007 appeal or comes from cerf funding and allocations of un non earmarked funds so in fact donors have directly given just 28 percent of the funds needed for 2008 not 44 percent
6435975 if funding trends do not significantly improve in the coming months this could have devastating consequences for nearly half a million people who heavily rely on humanitarian assistance for their survival
6435976 under funding is one of the greatest problems facing the protection sector particularly for children
6435977 it doesnt make any sense to provide shelter and food if we know children remain at serious risk of recruitment into armed forces sexual violence or other forms of abuse
6435978 these findings provide further evidence that the health system is falling short of where it needs to be to ensure health and
6435979 what is notable is how this is spreading up the income scale
6435980 even adults with insurance reported problems in getting needed care
6435981 for assuredly i say to you whoever says to this mountain be removed and be cast into the sea and does not doubt in his heart but believes that those things he says will be done he will have whatever he says
6435982 therefore i say to you whatever things you ask when you pray believe that you receive them and you will have them
6435983 and whenever you stand praying if you have anything against anyone forgive him that your father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses
6435984 but if you do not forgive neither will your father in heaven forgive your trespasses

6436005 there can hopefully be two versions of a film that exist
6436006 you gotta see this factor everyone feels like they discovered this movie
6436007 i was just trying to tell this big elaborate science fiction story
6436008 its like a john hughes movie of the 21st century

6436013 the question in this case is whether permitting authorities may supplement inadequate monitoring requirements when epa has taken no action
6436014 if the monitoring isnt good enough the whole system falls apart
6436015 affects every major stationary air pollution source in the country this is a very important case just in terms of the publics right to know and guarding the publics opportunity to keep tabs
6436016 determine the appropriate course of action once the review is complete we are still assessing the implications of the decision
6436017 is a complex statute with a clear objective it enlists epa and state and local environmental authorities in a common effort to create a permit program for most stationary sources of air pollution
6436018 by its terms this mandate means that a monitoring requirement insufficient to assure compliance with emission limits has no place in the permit unless and until it is supplemented by more rigorous standards
6436019 we are deeply concerned by this attack and the implication this could have on our ability to provide critical help
6436020 insecurity remains a constant problem in chad and the chad government should work to curtail the environment of impunity which permeates this region
6436021 the area is very poor there is not enough food whereas ngos have money and cars
6436022 but this time there is nothing to do with that to attack a health facility is quite extreme staff and patients have been beaten up this has nothing to do with money
6436023 i dont see us coming back within the next few weeks
6436024 if we are targeted it will be difficult to justify they have to find a way to control this violence
6436025 cazzo per dovrebbe capire che forse questa non la scelta giusta
6436026 oil has given a fairly significant boost to the fight against aids
6436027 it is thanks to the oil resources that we now have free arvs antiretrovirals which has enabled us to reassure our international partners that chad is keeping its promises to invest in priority social upliftment sectors
6436028 this drop in the amount granted to fight aids can simply be attributed to the war
6436029 as the budget wasnt discussed in parliament we can assume that other sectors such as health were sacrificed in aid of the war certain priority areas have not been taken into account or simply forgotten in the fight against aids

6436037 simply based on somebodys race religion or exercise of first amendment rights
6436038 this document clarifies the rules by which the f b i conducts its intelligence mission
6436039 this seems to be based on the idea that the government can take a bunch of data and create a profile that can be used to identify future bad guys
6436040 but that has not been demonstrated to be true anywhere else
6436041 persons who suffer from this unexplained skin condition report a range of cutaneous skin symptoms including crawling biting and stinging sensations granules threads fibers or black speck like materials on or beneath the skin and or skin lesions e g rashes or sores in addition to skin manifestations some sufferers also report fatigue mental confusion short term memory loss joint pain and changes in visions
6436042 to learn more about who may be affected with this condition the symptoms they experience and to look for clues about factors that might contribute to the condition
6436043 we are aware that many patients have suffered from this condition and i can tell you that here at cdc we have really been seeing an increasing number of these reports over the past year or so
6436044 all morgellons patients screened to date have tested positive for the presence of agrobacterium whereas this microorganism has not been detected in any of the samples derived from the control healthy individuals
6436045 agrobacterium may be involved in the etiology and or progression
6436046 theres almost always some history of exposure to dirt basically either from gardening or camping or something
6436047 release of these plants may also result in release of the
6436048 very few authors actually test to ensure that the antibiotics succeed
6436049 here is where the possibility of gene escape arises the presence of the disarmed agrobacterium in the tissue would not be a problem if the binary vector had been lost but now its survival and spread are real possibilities
6436050 the opportunistic and systemically moving agrobacterium vector infectious to a wide host range might eventually cause infection and damage to crop plants or natural vegetation
6436051 not presently visited by the traditional vectors of the virus disease
6436052 future research has to show whether agrobacterium mediated transformation contributed to horizontal gene transfer between microorganisms in the rhizosphere
6436053 have a ready route for horizontal gene escape via agrobacterium helped by the ordinary conjugative mechanisms of many other bacteria that cause diseases which are present in the environment
6436054 a well respected and award winning scientist ivins co wrote a slew of anthrax studies including a recent work on the treatment for inhalation anthrax published in the july 7 issue of the antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy journal
6436055 yet ivins had attempted to poison people as far back as 2000 and his therapist said she was
6436056 2 so much of the public reporting about ivins has been devoted to depicting him as a highly unstable psychotic who had been issuing extremely violent threats and who had a violent past
6436057 duley herself has a history that at the very least raises questions about her credibility
6436058 just three months ago duley pled guilty and was sentenced to probation with a suspended fine of 500 as a result of having been stopped in december while driving at 1 35 a m and charged with driving under the influence
6436059 i postulated that the real culprit of the 9 11 and anthrax attacks who engineered it all was thomas e enron white the former co chair of enron who subsequently became army secretary his dominate motive was cover his and others ass and assets was there a massive cover up white who was co chair again of enron was never indicated recently we are led to believe that bruce ivins was behind the anthrax attacks who worked out of the armys fort detrick biological center i wondered if there besides that was any direct connection between dr ivins and tom white
6436060 my veteran able danger colleagues and i share the common fear that the seeds of the next 9 11 attack have already been sewn and that much of the critical data that was harvested for the able danger project that could be used again now in the search for sleeper cells and others that matched the

6436063 it makes no sense to regularly target command and control nodes with precision guided munitions while denying highly capable sniper teams the ability to attack individual targets
6436064 the messy business of back alley tradecraft has taken a back seat to the much simpler business of liaison with foreign intelligence services
6436065 the committee for the liberation of iraq was the brainchild of the bush administration
6436066 it is said that once the saddam regime has been overthrown the cli will act as a shadow government for baghdad
6436067 but it will limit itself to policy matters and will not deal with details it will eventually press for a competitive petroleum production sharing regime which could make opec irrelevant to iraqs oil output or supply decisions
6436068 sessions with opinion makers contacts for journalists and mass marketing when the time is ripe
6436069 by joining our efforts senators mccain and lieberman highlight their commitment to ending the threat posed by saddam hussein and freeing the iraqi people
6436070 with nato now set to enlarge from 19 members to take on seven east european nations including the three baltic states it is said that both the bush team and the committee for the liberation of iraq want the political mechanism of the atlantic alliance to replace the un security council in giving multilateral legitimacy to any major u s action outside north america
6436071 this is because unlike the un security council where the french or russians might block american action natos political decisions do not require consensus only natos military decisions require consensus
6436072 considering the nations including the baltic states signed on the group at the expense of creating a schism in the european union the scheunemann initiative was unanimously regarded as a diplomatic triumph for washington and a coup detat in brussels

6436079 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pada suatu malam keluar dan shalat di masjid orang orang pun ikut shalat bersamanya dan mereka memperbincangkan shalat tersebut hingga berkumpullah banyak orang ketika beliau shalat mereka pun ikut shalat bersamanya mereka meperbincangkan lagi hingga bertambah banyaklah penghuni masjid pada malam ketiga rasulullah shallalalhu alaihi wa sallam keluar dan shalat ketika malam keempat masjid tidak mampu menampung jamaah hingga beliau hanya keluar untuk melakukan shalat shubuh
6436080 amma badu sesungguhnya aku mengetahui perbuatan kalian semalam namun aku khawatir diwajibkan atas kalian sehingga kalian tidak mampu mengamalkannya
6436081 aku keluar bersama umar bin al khaththab radhiyallahu anhu suatu malam di bulan ramadhan ke masjid ketika itu manusia berkelompok kelompok 2 ada yang shalat sendirian dan ada yang berjamaah maka umar berkata
6436082 sebaik baik bidah adalah ini orang yang tidur lebih baik dari yang bangun ketika itu manusia shalat di awal malam
6436083 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam tidak pernah shalat malam di bulan ramadhan atau selainnya lebih dari sebelas rakaat
6436084 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam menghidupkan malam ramadhan bersama manusia delapan rakaat kemudian witir
6436085 umar bin al khaththab menyuruh ubay bin kaab dan tamim ad daari untuk mengimami manusia dengan sebelas rakaat
6436086 ketika itu imam membaca dua ratus ayat hingga kami bersandar bertelekan pada tongkat karena lamanya berdiri kami tidak pulang kecuali ketika furu fajar
6436087 bahwa umar mengumpulkan manusia di bulan ramadhan dengan dua puluh satu rakaat membaca dua ratus ayat selesai ketika awal fajar
6436088 hai orang orang yang beriman diwajibkan atas kamu berpuasa sebagaimana diwajibkan atas orang orang sebelum kamu agar kamu bertaqwa

6436090 barokah itu ada pada tiga perkara ats tsarid dan makan sahur
6436091 tidak dikenal perawi lainnya tsiqat dipercaya red hadits ini mempunyai syahid saksi penguat red dalam riwayat abu hurairah yang diriwayatkan oleh al khatib dalam munadih auhumul sami watafriq 1 203 sanadnya hasan
6436092 sesungguhnya makan sahur adalah barakah yang allah berikan kepada kalian maka janganlah kalian tinggalkan
6436093 sahur itu makanan yang barakah janganlah kalian meninggalkannya walaupun hanya meneguk setengah air karena allah dan malaikat nya bershalawat kepada orang orang yang sahur
6436094 kami makan sahur bersama rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam kemudian beliau shalat
6436095 di antara kebiasaan arab mengukur waktu dengan amalan mereka misal kira kira selama memeras kambing fawaqa naqah waktu antara dua perasan selama menyembelih onta sehingga zaid pun memakai ukuran lamanya baca mushaf sebagai isyarat dari beliau radhiyallahu anhu bahwa waktu itu adalah waktu ibadah dan amalan mereka membaca dan mentadhabur
6436096 pembeda antara puasa kami dan ahlul kitab adalah makan sahur
6436097 sahur adalah makanan yang barakah janganlah kalian tinggalkan walaupun hanya meminum seteguk air karena allah dan malaikat nya memberi sahalawat kepada orang orang yang sahur

6436226 here i am at the grand canyon here i am again there
6436227 to stand upon the edge of this stupendous gorge as it receives its earliest greeting from the god of day is to enjoy in a moment compensation for long years of ordinary uneventful life
6436228 it is impossible in a few pages to do justice in the smallest degree to the great gorge itself
6436229 somebody fill this fucking thing in so we can move on
6436230 the spectacle is so symmetrical and so completely excludes the outside world and its accustomed standards it is with difficulty one can acquire any notion of its immensity

6436233 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one

6436237 she is dealing with a lot right now but it is a discussion that needs to take place
6436238 the difference here is that she has cancer she is not simply at risk for cancer
6436239 she needs to deal with what she is dealing with right now which is the breast cancer
6436240 the barack obama and john mccain campaigns have agreed to hold three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate in september and october sponsored by the commission on presidential debates the campaigns have come to the earliest agreement on presidential debates reached in any general election in recent history this announcement reflects the presidential campaigns agreement on dates locations and the formats for the fall debates campaign appointed debate negotiators house democratic caucus chairman rahm emanuel d il and senator lindsey graham r sc said they were pleased to have reached an early agreement to provide the american people with the opportunity to see and hear the candidates debate the critical issues facing the country the two campaigns have accepted sponsorship of the debates by the commission on presidential debates subject to the debates being conducted under the terms of their agreement

6436252 we are waiting to hear from the authorities what we should do with them
6436253 unfortunately this is all too common this trade is a far bigger threat to these species than habitat destruction
6436254 the vigilance on the border has to be improved cooperation with source countries needs to be strengthened there should be better monitoring of dealers and the people violating the laws must be penalised severely
6436255 we serve it in hotpot that is the tastiest way
6436256 we keep them alive in cages until the customer makes an order then we hammer them unconscious cut their throats and drain the blood it is a slow death we then boil them to remove the scales we cut the meat into small pieces and use it to make a number of dishes including braised meat and soup usually the customers take the blood home with them afterwards
6436257 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill
6436258 hes having difficulties breathing and his flippers were at an unnatural angle
6436259 their advice to us was hes not going to last much longer hes suffering and you should take action
6436260 theyll need to locate it first and the poor little guy could have passed away in the night
6436261 once they figure out whats happened theyll take it from there
6436262 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard for
6436263 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work
6436264 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6436265 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6436266 get it into the vicinity of the other cow and calf and hopefully the cow would take on two calves which would be pretty unusual
6436267 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem
6436268 even if they are able to entice the calf out into open water it would face a higher predation pressure from sharks
6436269 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6436270 the key here is hes weakening hes losing the strength to get him fed and to a pod that will care for him
6436271 obamas support among voters between the ages of 18 and 29 which had been one of his strengths slipped 12 percentage points to 52 percent mccain who will turn 72 next week was winning 40 percent of younger voters
6436272 im so sick of reading headlines like obama slams mccain or vice versa
6436273 i thought that this campaign would actually be different but its not its depressing

6436277 the only question is is the finished product when it comes to market substantially similar to the original drawing
6436278 you have to judge this not from the standpoint of a professional doll sculptor but from the standpoint of a child thats the law
6436279 the evidence is uncontroverted that the drawings portray older edgier sexier dolls
6436280 the eyebrows were way too aggressive the lips way too pronounced the face way too harsh what mga made is a prettier doll that could compete
6436281 can you see a parent saying to their child why do you want that you have a substantially similar doll back home
6436282 something else is going on besides mattels property in contributing to sales
6436283 in history there have only been two successful fashion dolls barbie and bratz and mr larian and mr bryant stole one of those
6436284 the numbers are what they are and the law says when you profit by taking someone elses confidential information you have to give it back

6436288 i was trying to accommodate his request because he is the chancellor
6436289 it wasnt very appropriate but it was truthful i would have selected better wording if i had to do it again
6436290 the issue did come up and dr pearson dealt with it
6436291 i remember mr earnest calling me and saying she was not doing her job as she should
6436292 im not aware of any of that i wasnt her direct supervisor
6436293 i think any educated person with a decent personality could do that
6436294 he had discussed that previously that was his idea not sues not roys
6436295 we thought her position in the legislature would be helpful primarily she had access to people we needed to get access to
6436296 if you make a good hire and you do a bad job of supervising doesnt that set up a failure

6436300 lynn had a quiet but very warm personality and was an inspiring mentor to many fine students over the years
6436301 a characteristic of his life and work was his strong belief that one had to balance rigorous standards of proof with openness to new ideas in uncharted areas lynn kept up his thinking and writing about various topics right to the end

6436304 theres no reason to try to better my life because theres no such thing as something better than anything else there just is
6436305 i refuse to make a decision until we get all the facts straight
6436306 youve released all thoughts labels and judgment and you simply are when you do this theres a subtle feeling that theres no longer a difference between you and everyone else between what in here and whats out there
6436307 i was so obsessed with thinking outside the box it began to follow me around

6436311 non oecd oil demand growth of 1 2 mb d will account for all of the world oil demand growth next year
6436312 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6436313 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6436314 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance
6436315 as consumers look to stay connected and entertained regardless of where they are and what device they are using the web continues to affect our lives in new ways and is quickly moving to the tv thanks to a new generation of internet connected ce devices
6436316 as intel delivers its first ia soc system on a chip with leading edge performance and internet compatibility for consumer electronics devices we are providing a powerful and flexible technology foundation upon which the industry can quickly innovate
6436317 this technology foundation will help the hi tech industry bring devices to market faster as well as encourage new designs and inspire new services such as connecting the tv to the internet
6436318 canmore first left our design lab for manufacturing late last year and the very first chip was produced by fab 24 at the end of last year fab 24 literally established new records in giving the fastest turnaround possible it was simply amazing
6436319 the first chip out of the factory in leixlip was so good that i was able to demonstrate this to the whole world at the 2008 ces
6436320 my take on the situation is that security companies have done a good job of convincing people that their products are essential if you are to keep your system free of badware thats not true but im not going to get into that argument right now and as such the incentive to develop a good solid product is lost
6436321 ive gotten to the point where i think id rather take my chances with the bad guys myself rather than bother with so called security software
6436322 there were bodies lying everywhere and wounded people soaked in blood were screaming for help
6436323 many of the wounded were either without legs or hands i could see body parts hanging on trees
6436324 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6436325 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6436326 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6436327 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6436328 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6436329 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6436330 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
6436331 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6436332 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6436333 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6436334 is god willing to prevent evil but not able then he is not omnipotent
6436335 we do feel its important we drive this potential land sale to a conclusion one way or another weve been working on this for more than two years
6436336 its now formal if we show up with the money well be able to purchase the land
6436337 if we didnt think it would be successful we wouldnt be looking at it
6436338 there was a bench here then and as i sat there with winston i watched a beetle slowly moving across the floor if that beetle reaches that crack i said to myself and winston hasnt proposed then he isnt going to but he did propose
6436339 sarmat kapisov ran all night through the forest with his family fleeing the fighting in south ossetia and headed for the georgia russia border
6436340 we usually get participants from 10 to 45 years old
6436341 we really try to make it as cost feasible as possible
6436342 we and the kids wanted to do something different other than floor hockey
6436343 it was a good transition most of the kids have athletic ability
6436344 it is so nice to see improvement in the kids
6436345 for a lot of the kids theyve never been away from home so that too is a good experience the most important thing is that they learn how to get along with other and everyone helps each other out
6436346 for the first few weeks of practice we dont even put pucks on the ice
6436347 all we do is work on the skills and sometimes the kids dont even realize theyre learning because theyre having fun
6436348 the most rewarding experience of all is watching the smiles on all the kids faces
6436349 im just focusing now on getting my fitness levels back up to 100 per cent
6436350 pienso que l disfrut del juego ha estado muy ocupado y cansado de tantas actividades pero a n se tom tiempo para ver nuestro deporte
6436351 el mismo sentimiento lo traslado hacia samaranch fue bueno tenerlos porque nuestro deporte necesita m s apoyo
6436352 but mr monster hunter and pirate ahmadinejad is iranian and this is the us presidency
6436353 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
6436354 if the holocaust is a reality of our time a history that occurred why is there not sufficient research that can approach the topic from different perspectives
6436355 anybody who recognizes israel will burn in the fire of the islamic nations fury
6436356 israel is a rotten dried tree that will be annihilated in one storm
6436357 those who insulted the prophet should know that you cannot obscure the sun with a handful of dust the dust will just get back and blind your own eyes
6436358 iranians possess delicate characteristics they introduce their merits which are extremely attractive to whole the world
6436359 could 9 11 be planned and executed without coordination with intelligence and security services or their extensive infiltration of course this is just an educated guess why have the various aspects of the attacks been kept secret why are we not told who botched their responsibilities and why arent those responsible and the guilty parties identified and put on trial
6436360 once you get into the routine it is really fun for a coach anyway you are doing football every day your meals are regulated and you are on a real good schedule in some ways you dont look forward to the end of it
6436361 over the next couple days whats kind of going to tell where im at in terms of my progress is the amount of swelling that is in there
6436362 and how quickly we can get it out of there is going to be how quickly i can get back on the field
6436363 when we got in here that was our goal to get better as an individual and as an offensive unit and weve done that were just better as an offense our communication understanding the system knowing their roles execution weve gotten better
6436364 we improved on a lot of things that we really wanted to focus on i thought we really got better as the weeks went on the good thing is that camp is just the start though we still have a couple of preseason games left and some more time to get ready for the regular season but we got off to a good start
6436365 we accomplished our installation on both sides of the ball and all of the things we wanted to get done we got done you just have to wait to see how the season goes
6436366 estoy muy contenta regreso con medallas y estoy entre las cinco primeras de mundo regreso contenta
6436367 hicimos un muy buen equipo dimos la mejor y creo que las dos estamos muy satisfechas y ya estamos listas para regresar a m xico

6436395 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work
6436396 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6436397 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6436398 get it into the vicinity of the other cow and calf and hopefully the cow would take on two calves which would be pretty unusual
6436399 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem
6436400 even if they are able to entice the calf out into open water it would face a higher predation pressure from sharks

6436470 blogging is like so 2007 that triggered some thoughts ive had on blogging and growth in it he talks about how the there are many more ways to publish your thoughts to the web other than your blog lifestreaming and how that fractured state leads to less value being placed in blogging
6436471 creating hyperlinks between images and its doing that based on the content inside of the images
6436472 when you do a web search for images you type in phrases and the text on the web page is carrying lots of information about that photograph what if that picture links to your pictures
6436473 this is something that grows in complexity as people use it

6436484 kids definitely spend more time online during the summer months
6436485 but very often parents will try to curtail that time now with school back in the picture kids have the excuse they need to legally be online and surfing the internet
6436486 instead of doing research for a report they may be updating their facebook pages
6436487 there is no doubt that kids keep in constant touch over the internet throughout the summer
6436488 but they may find themselves becoming friends with classmates they werent friends with before or perhaps befriending the new student at school add to that the joining of special clubs or sports and there is a definite chance of new friends popping up on your childs social network page and im buddy lists

6436493 you just knew gene upshaw was eventually going to go on to something great
6436494 wed take trips to our capital at sacramento and id watch him moving among those politicians and just marvel sometimes sort of half kidding half serious i used to call him governor because thats what i always guessed hed be
6436495 if thats what they say i will say this id want him to represent my side in labor negotiations
6436496 the players should be thanking him actually they should be genuflecting
6436497 he knows how to set his sights on his goal and pursue it relentlessly
6436498 he wanted a bigger piece of the pie for the players some of us took the position that revenue sharing might be good for league but its none of your business you know you just go ahead and make a labor deal
6436499 i think some people thought he was arguing but not really committed to the principle suddenly it started to dawn on people that the guy really means it over time he spoke with more and more owners
6436500 youre talking about a football fight versus a fight for the seat on the bus
6436501 theres no comparison people were dying in the era where you were fighting for rights fighting for a voice but i do think his enthusiasm the fire in his heart was homegrown
6436502 segregation wasnt one of those things that was discussed life was laid out in front of you i found the world as it was in the 50s and saw it change the value system that was there allowed me to see the change and how i could further impact that change
6436503 part of the reason hes been successful is his parents and his family background it enabled him to get through the segregated south with a positive rather than cynical view of what can be accomplished what changes are possible
6436504 gene is an interesting combination of hardheaded realist and idealist he is much more interested in progress than rhetoric
6436505 it was very rare for a big man to get out and run like he did the raiders would run that weak side lead led by art shell and gene upshaw and theyd continue to run because we couldnt stop it
6436506 he was one of those guys who could do everything pass protection as well as run blocking
6436507 very few guys are good in the trenches and out on the perimeter versatility thats what he had then and thats what he has now after football
6436508 there was never any question because he embodied all the things youd admire in a man
6436509 great integrity extraordinary intelligence great judgment and he had an unbending will
6436510 wed be on capitol hill having meetings with congressmen and senators and hed be completely at ease he was a charismatic character but he never forgot the everyday people he would always stop and talk to the doorman at player rep meetings he would say hello to all the waiters and walk into the kitchen and talk to the cooks like he was the owner
6436511 what kind of shape was the union in after the strike
6436512 we hadnt been obliterated in negotiations but we had been bloodied hey if you could get up in the morning and the building was still standing well you had won
6436513 im looking at the books every day and seeing the amount of debt
6436514 it was more important for them than it was for me originally i only agreed to a six month term but it became obvious that i had to stay i knew what had to be done
6436515 it was really an important watershed moment in our history because we finally came to grips with how important it was to fight for free agency
6436516 gene was the best at his position yet he didnt have a choice where he played when everybody has a choice they get treated differently
6436517 the most important thing was we drew a line in the sand the owners overreached and tried to get us to take a bad deal we said no and we lived to fight another day
6436518 the facts are he got an advance that he didnt realize hed gotten
6436519 it was an accounting error and it was corrected two weeks later the reagan labor department took a good hard run at him but they didnt have a case
6436520 the union is in place to protect the players not the owners if the union isnt doing its job it shouldnt be there
6436521 it was a roll of the dice an all or nothing bet
6436522 the interesting thing the harder it gets the simpler it gets we had two choices surrender or fight as a staff we were betting not just our jobs but our careers gene most of all
6436523 it was about how to change the relationship with the players association and to make it less adversarial and less confrontational and build a relationship of respect and trust
6436524 weve tried to do that over the years gene upshaw and i and the owners and the players association executive committee he and i have always been on the same page when it comes to trying to make this system work fairly
6436525 until we achieved free agency i always viewed the nfl as the last plantation
6436526 the players need to have their freedom i knew that once they got that theyd get everything else
6436527 it was after all that id been through growing up that i was able to see that
6436528 i saw what was happening in baseball and hockey and i could see our sport going in the same direction
6436529 the gulf between the high revenue and low revenue clubs was beginning to be so wide that with another negotiation it might have been too late
6436530 i have always said the only time this agreement will ever fall apart is if either side gets greedy and they were starting to get greedy
6436531 the key was his commitment to that revenue sharing issue
6436532 people would say why should he even care as long as players get cap money he wanted all players to have a piece of all the money that was his goal and he never wavered
6436533 paul tagliabue had made it clear for a while that we were not going to be able to just extend the contract that the time was about right for a change
6436534 right from the start gene was able to sell the commissioner on the contract and then it was ok this is where were at now
6436535 gene tell me what will it take to move the free agency deadline
6436536 only under one circumstance take my proposal to dallas for the owners with no changes and give it a yes or no vote thats it
6436537 we each moved to a midpoint but then nobody was moving and it was getting late gene laid down the ultimatum this is it paul had a duty to present it to the owners to walk away at that point would have been irresponsible
6436538 upshaw and the players did a good job in establishing their petition early and sticking to it
6436539 continually putting the focus on the parallel negotiation the large market versus small market owners was in my mind a brilliant thing to do
6436540 upshaw played on the classic idea that uncertainty is bad for business once the owners realized it was such a fabulous business nobody wanted to go down the road and kill the golden goose
6436541 i wasnt going to take a deal back to my players that i didnt believe in
6436542 uncertainty breeds uncertainty look at history a good cba has benefits for both sides whether its u s steel the automotive industry or the nfl this extension does that were all doing well the rising tide lifts all boats
6436543 from the point of view of the new england patriots looking at our isolated situation this is a bad deal
6436544 but looking at it in terms of putting our league hat on its right at the edge maybe a little bit over in terms of a great deal for the union
6436545 gene pushed it right to the limit and he did a heck of a job and those of us who care about what makes the league special found a way to man together clubs like ourselves and come up with a plan that took substantial dollars out of our pockets paul tagliabue and gene upshaw have formed a unique partnership its a tribute to the two of them that they were able to do it
6436546 there was enough of us and maybe a time and place for that they got right to the point where they were overreaching if that does happen if you go over the border youre going to have to go through some more of those tough times
6436547 in the current climate the nfl would have locked the players out it happened to the nba twice and you saw it in the nhl too it would have been the best strategy for the owners the only way to defeat the attempt to lock out players would be to decertify we were prepared to do it
6436548 he played in three super bowls and hes a hall of fame player
6436549 it takes a great deal to get gene riled he is always a bedrock no matter what kind of waters are swirling around him
6436550 youd have to ignore the decertification and the six following years
6436551 the strike collapses and decertification well it kind of looks like desperation and then you have to win the lawsuit without dues i dont know what could have been harder than that this time he looked like he was taking a stroll through the park
6436552 once they stopped trying to put us out of business and approached the union as a partner
6436553 jeff is what gene calls his lead dog he gets out front and pushes ideas
6436554 there are times in meetings when gene says no thats not authorized im not saying that jeff is bright and quick and full of ideas sometimes a little bit of what he says is right in the end gene makes his own calls
6436555 every leagues union except the nfls has chosen to hire professional leadership the nfl players association hired a former player you see the results
6436556 unwittingly the league did the impossible it made gene upshaw look smart
6436557 he doesnt spend a lot of time promoting himself i know hes turned down hundreds of interview opportunities sometimes we yell at him about that he reminds us that he can communicate better with the players better in a locker room than in a magazine story
6436558 because we achieved labor peace in football without massive disruptions to the sport
6436559 when youre dealing with the nfl so much is expected
6436560 they move around cities senators even presidents if they have to but were still the players
6436561 people see him too much as a hall of fame player not as institutional leader
6436562 i mean when they talk about african american ceos i dont know too many more powerful and influential than he is
6436563 you dont get much credit for being a man of color
6436564 i can personally say that because im a man of color
6436565 seventy five percent of the league is african american and yet thats not translating into head coaching positions or ownership why is that its ok for us to score touchdowns and make big tackles and interceptions but its still not ok to lead your team as a quarterback
6436566 its a sad lingering part of our society the reality is that gene upshaw and nba union chief billy hunter dont always get the credit they deserve they are effective powerful leaders who have gotten extraordinary gains for their players
6436567 thats a factor theres no doubt about it you think about where this job has taken me and what i have to deal with in so many meetings seminars and negotiations im the only black face in the room
6436568 people criticize me saying now that hes had success hes soft on the job he used to be a radical but now hes too close to paul tagliabue its all just chatter if we dont have a good relationship were not sitting here talking about the cba
6436569 people see the labor peace and they say someones gone soft
6436570 we decided on our message three years ago and we stayed on that message
6436571 we told them the more the deal drags on the more educated the players will be and its going to be harder on you
6436572 that was the last time they were going to see those numbers the next time they were going to be a lot higher
6436573 i was asked a few years ago if i would be interested
6436574 the only way would be to change voting procedures from the three fourths vote to a majority its so difficult to do that job i dont consider myself a candidate but if someone else does thats fine
6436575 im going to tell you what i told my three boys a few years ago
6436576 we have an age requirement in the union you have to leave at age 65 well im 60 years old so between now and then ill decide
6436577 i will not be here past age 65 but no im not planning on leaving any time soon
6436578 global demand for all types of energy has risen steeply and supplies of finite resources like oil and gas are under intense pressure

6436731 ras proteins exist in all cells anchored to the inside of the cell membrane where they regulate cell growth and cell division the enzyme we are studying helps ras proteins get anchored to the cell membrane by blocking this enzyme we were able to inhibit the binding of ras proteins to cell membranes and greatly improve the disease symptoms in mice with blood cancer
6436732 when we inhibited the production of the enzyme the development of blood cancer declined and the uncontrolled growth of bone marrow cells was blocked another discovery was that normal bone marrow cells were not significantly affected by the icmt enzyme the means that future drugs for inhibiting icmt could specifically target the pathogenic cells and leave normal cells intact a drub that blocks this enzyme could be an effective future cancer treatment

6436734 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 an ounce
6436735 there are many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can use hydrogen as fuel how to make it how to transport it how to create the infrastructure for people to fill their cars with it
6436736 our research lends itself to whats called a distributed production strategy instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralized facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6436737 precious metals have high catalytic activity and in most cases high stability but theyre also very expensive so our goal from the outset was to come up with a precious metal free catalyst one that was based on metals that are readily available and inexpensive but still highly active and stable so that sets us apart from most of the other groups in the world
6436738 whenever a process works at a lower temperature that brings energy savings and cost savings
6436739 also if the catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields we dont need as much of it that will bring down the size of the reactor and its cost
6436740 in all our 30 years helping uk buyers find florida dream homes the market has never been so full of bargains

6436743 we have been helping uk home and holiday ownership buyers in florida for nearly 30 years with companies such as disney marriott hilton sheraton and many of our industrys leading multi national building companies we believe there really has never been a better time for uk investors to buy in florida

6436760 las regulaciones pentateucas eran para mitigar las causas de que las personas tuvieran que servir como esclavos los extranjeros residentes los hu rfanos y las viudas no deb an de ser abusados oprimidos o deprivados de justicia cuando se les prestaba dinero a los pobres no se deb a cobrar inter s en cualquier otra zona del cercano oriente los intereses exorbitantes sobre los pr stamos eran la primer causa de que la gente se vendiera en esclavitud

6436763 la mayor a de los casos registrados donde personas libres ingresan al sistema de esclavitud en emar son debido a deudas hambruna o ambas

6436771 en la mayor a de las sociedades neol ticas y de la edad de bronce los esclavos no ten an derechos sobre su vida desde el antiguo egipto hasta las estepas de eurasia los esclavos eran sepultados vivos o muertos con sus amos para que los acompa aran al m s all entre los indios tinglit de la costa noroeste los amos mataban a sus esclavos en ceremonias llamadas potlatches sin traducci n al espa ol para demostrar su desprecio por las riquezas y propiedades tambi n mataban a los esclavos viejos o de poco uso y arrojaban sus cuerpos al oc ano pac fico un amo pod a matar impunemente a sus esclavos en la grecia de homero la antigua india la rep blica romana la china han los pa ses isl micos la inglaterra anglosajona la rusia medieval y muchas partes de sur americano antes de 1830 este no fue el caso en otras sociedades los hebreos los atenienses y los romanos bajo el principado restringieron el derecho de los due os sobre la vida de los esclavos de su propiedad
6436772 la esclavitud dom stica era con toda probabilidad bien tolerable los esclavos formaban parte de la familia y los varones si circuncidados pod an tomar parte en la pascua de la familia y otras funciones religiosas
6436773 la mano de obra esclava era usada en el servicio dom stico y por ende creaba una relaci n estrecha entre el se or y el siervo
6436774 el trato de los esclavos propiedad indica que estos esclavos eran considerados seres humanos
6436775 la dignidad personal del esclavo se evidencia tambi n en las prescripciones relacionadas con las lesiones personales ex 21 20 27 claramente los derechos personales de los esclavos prevalecen sobre los derechos de propiedad por parte del due o

6436779 siervos obedeced a vuestros amos terrenales con temor y temblor con sencillez de vuestro coraz n como a cristo no sirviendo al ojo como los que quieren agradar a los hombres sino como siervos de cristo de coraz n haciendo la voluntad de dios sirviendo de buena voluntad como al se or y no a los hombres sabiendo que el bien que cada uno hiciere se recibir del se or sea siervo o sea libre y vosotros amos haced con ellos lo mismo dejando las amenazas sabiendo que el se or de ellos y vuestro est en los cielos y que para l no hay acepci n de personas
6436780 siervos obedeced en todo a vuestros amos terrenales no sirviendo al ojo como los que quieren agradar a los hombres sino con coraz n sincero temiendo a dios y todo lo que hag is hacedlo de coraz n como para el se or y no para los hombres sabiendo que del se or recibir is la recompensa de la herencia porque a cristo el se or serv s mas el que hace injusticia recibir la injusticia que hiciere porque no hay acepci n de personas

6436782 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6436783 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6436784 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6436785 instead here is a case where processing is positive in terms of enhancing absorption of lycopene
6436786 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
6436787 some people like to cook tomato sauce for prolonged periods sometimes reheating it day after day because it tastes better on the second and third day they add fat by using oil or meat and thats going to start to induce cis isomers of lycopene if fat is present and the cooking continues
6436788 so its possible people could induce this process and increase lycopene absorption by routine food preparation procedures as well
6436789 the percentage of households entering foreclosure in the area was almost as shocking a number as the notice of default and notice of trustee sales
6436790 in riverside county 9 54 percent of the households entered foreclosure while the number was slightly lower in san bernardino at 7 45 percent considering that the national average is 2 percent it is clear this area is still getting buried by foreclosures

6436825 abu dhabi is an obvious choice for a boat show as it is the richest of the oil laden united arab emirates has a large expatriate population and is aiming to transform itself into a global tourist destination
6436826 diverse sports amp leisure pursuits are part of the active lifestyle residents enjoy in abu dhabi and the most recently announced 2009 formula 1 abu dhabi prix ferrari theme park and warner brothers theme park are all situated on the yas island a 2 500 hectare island development
6436827 we have received overwhelming support from abu dhabi as the host and from the marine industry in particular with regard to the timing of the show
6436828 with the emirates boat show international in abu dhabi we will be well on the way to providing the luxury marine industry in the middle east with a year round calendar of events that marine enthusiasts could look forward to
6436829 for us at knotika boat shows are not just about boats but also everything that goes with the marine lifestyle
6436830 people do not buy a boat just to own it they want to enjoy it to live the culture and that is what we are bringing to abu dhabi this is not simply a boat show it is a marine lifestyle exhibition where they will be able to see and buy the latest coolest and must have yachts and marine products

6436834 again we are always pleased to see an improvement in the foreclosure situation even if it is just a month to month adjustment
6436835 although southern california was hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis the northern part of the state has also been significantly affected but not as much in san francisco even in san francisco though median home prices have declined
6436836 the region has seen prices fall approximately 20 to 25 percent since the middle of 2006
6436837 however median home prices and inventories in northern california have begun to level off in the past few months

6436843 im letzten jahr haben wir mit der gr ndung der drei servicegesellschaften das solide fundament f r einen besseren und konkurrenzf higeren kundenservice geschaffen die ergebnisse k nnen sich sehen lassen die erreichbarkeit unserer servicehotlines die vom kunden wahrgenommene servicequalit t und die termintreue unserer techniker haben wir deutlich verbessert f r die mitarbeiter eine moderne bearbeitungssoftware in die kundeninformationssysteme eingespielt und den service samstag eingef hrt mit letzterem haben wir sogar ma st be f r die telekommunikationsbranche gesetzt
6436844 aber wir m ssen weiter an der zukunftsf higkeit unserer organisation arbeiten deshalb packen wir nun die n chsten aufgaben an
6436845 im marktvergleich haben wir zu viele und zu kleine service center die bauliche und auch die technische ausstattung insgesamt entspricht l ngst nicht mehr dem erforderlichen branchenstandard um f r unsere kunden noch besser zu werden und den mitarbeitern bessere arbeitsbedingungen zu bieten wollen wir innerhalb der n chsten zwei jahre in 24 st dten die vorhandenen service center zu modernen und attraktiven zentren ausbauen in denen unsere mitarbeiter gut arbeiten k nnen und dies auch gerne tun
6436846 gleichzeitig bleiben wir mit unseren service centern in der fl che deutschlands vertreten da wir bei der planung darauf geachtet haben dass die 24 st dte ber das ganze bundesgebiet verteilt sind eine verlagerung ins ausland wie es andere unternehmen tun ist f r uns berhaupt kein thema
6436847 wir brauchen also gr ere standorte mit der neuen struktur kommen wir auf eine durchschnittliche standortgr e von etwa 700 mitarbeitern auf dieser basis sind service center wie sie f r die anforderungen eines modernen telekommunikationsunternehmens wie der deutschen telekom notwendig sind wesentlich wirtschaftlicher zu betreiben damit haben wir eine gute balance zwischen zeitgem en arbeitsplatzbedingungen und betriebswirtschaftlichen notwendigkeiten gefunden wie z b branchen bliche kosten f r informationssysteme sowie ausstattungs und mietkosten
6436848 daf r haben wir sogar den einen oder anderen kleineren standort in das neue konzept aufgenommen
6436849 das spornt an f hrt zu besseren ergebnissen und ist damit gut f r unsere kunden
6436850 bei der auswahl der 24 st dte haben wir intensiv gepr ft wie die notwendige zusammenlegung f r unternehmen und mitarbeiter bestm glich realisiert werden kann nat rlich wird es f r einen teil der mitarbeiter dadurch l ngere fahrtzeiten zum arbeitsplatz geben
6436851 auch hier streben wir sozialvertr gliche l sungen an sollte in einzelf llen aber aufgrund von speziellen berufs und lebenssituationen die fahrt zum neuen arbeitsplatz oder ein umzug f r eine mitarbeiterin oder einen mitarbeiter nicht m glich sein werden wir nach kr ften l sungen suchen
6436852 die eingliederung der technik zentren ist ein logischer und konsequenter schritt der aus der gr ndung der deutschen telekom netzproduktion gmbh vor mehr als einem jahr folgt
6436853 schon damals haben wir die vollst ndige b ndelung der technikkompetenzen erwogen aber aufgrund der komplexit t zun chst zur ckgestellt heute blicken wir auf mehr als ein jahr positiver erfahrungen bei den servicegesellschaften zur ck telekom service und die damit verbundene st rkung unternehmerischer verantwortung hat sich bew hrt
6436854 ja die mitarbeiter werden beispielsweise die gleiche wochenarbeitszeit wie ihre kollegen haben also statt 34 dann 38 stunden arbeiten und auch das gehalt soll auf das niveau der servicegesellschaften gebracht werden nat rlich mit den bekannten abfederungen damit st rken wir die wirtschaftliche leistungsf higkeit unserer netzproduktion im interesse unserer kunden und damit letztlich auch unserer mitarbeiter
6436855 wir wissen dass wir noch einen langen weg vor uns haben wir werden f r unsere kunden weiter an der verbesserung der servicequalit t arbeiten ein hochmodernes netz f r tolle produkte bauen und m glichst vielen menschen einen sicheren arbeitsplatz bieten

6436876 i never had a problem with this circuit i adored it in fact but in 1975 i was concerned about safety because i didnt think the barriers were correctly installed to my mind though montju c is one of the most beautiful street circuits that ever existed its fantastic the last two corners before the pits were uphill and our cornering speeds were close to those we achieved at silverstones woodcote in the days when it was a flat out right hander but to do that on a street circuit it was very challenging an absolutely unbelievable place
6436877 the final three laps of that race were the most anxious of my career
6436878 i had a rear puncture and could feel the cars back end moving around i looked in the mirror and saw the left side tyre deflect on the wheel i thought well id better carry on at all the left handed corners i was putting in a tremendous amount of effort but through the right handers i was being very careful because i knew i might spin i had to take a decision should i come into the pits and lose the grand prix or stay out and have a chance to win or maybe crash
6436879 i have raced old cars at epic tracks such as monaco macau and le mans
6436880 but i always imagined this place would be off limits i know were not racing but its nice to get some kind of feel for its character its not really a street circuit as such its a proper balls out racetrack that just happens to be on public roads

6436929 i am deeply sad that leo has passed away he was a personal friend for well over 40 years
6436930 i worked with him first as his constituency party secretary and later of course as his successor as mp for torfaen
6436931 he was a very distinguished parliamentarian and social reformer who has left an indelible mark on his country the lives of millions of people over the years have been improved because of his social reforms
6436932 leo was a passionate welshman and a fine constituency mp for the eastern valley which he represented in parliament for nearly 30 years
6436933 i personally owe him a great debt and i know that mps from all sides of the house will mourn his passing
6436934 leo was courageous highly principled very funny and totally unique
6436935 we are glad that he had such a long and fulfilling life in which he gained so much social progress by being an outstanding free thinking socialist
6436936 it is very rare for one mp to have been involved in so many major pieces of social legislation in relation to homosexuality divorce and abortion which have had a huge impact on the whole of british society
6436937 that is perhaps a tribute to how leo used his legal knowledge built up in his law practice leo abse and cohen and then applied it to his work in the house of commons in such a remarkable way
6436938 when i first joined the labour party in 1963 it was as a member of cardiff south east labour party whose full time office was in the attic above leo abse and cohen headquarters at 36 churchill way cardiff
6436939 his passing is a huge loss to politics and public life in wales and he will be fondly remembered in torfaen in cardiff and throughout britain
6436940 leo abse was a courageous campaigner and a superb representative for the people of pontypool and torfaen for more than 30 years his loss will be felt not only in the labour movement but across the political spectrum
6436941 our thoughts are with his wife ania and his family at this very sad time
6436942 as a nation we should be grateful for his contribution as a parliamentarian he spearheaded some of the most momentous changes in legislation paving the way for greater equality
6436943 his successes in parliament freed many from the shackles of paternalism and bigotry allowing us some of the basic liberties we now take for granted
6436944 his commitment to justice and modernity made him a formidable force in the case for change
6436945 im assuming you have lube and a condom somewhere in here
6436946 there is a tendency to make fun of people who get involved in these sorts of things brad went there new orleans builds houses he can do a lot of other things with his time he and angie really put their money where their mouth is im always very impressed by them
6436947 ive bought a couple of those houses already that hes building

6436968 we are very pleased with the confidence cowen healthcare royalty partners is showing our first marketed product by purchasing the rights to the fenoglide royalty stream we are proud to be one of the very few danish specialty pharmaceutical companies who have taken a product directly to the us primary care market

6437001 russia sent more tanks troops and rocket launchers in the breakaway georgian region of south ossetia this morning amid fears that it is planning a new front against georgia in the west
6437002 the dollar is slowly becoming an i o u nothing
6437003 i come here tonight with a cure for a broken heart as well
6437004 im preaching to me as much as im preaching to you tonight
6437005 some people have asked me whether i am angry at god because my son is no longer here
6437006 but how can i be mad at a god who holds my son safely in his arms tonight its hard knowing that i wont see my son again on earth but i have the assurance that christopher is in heaven because he put his faith in jesus i havent lost my son because i know where he is and someday i will join him
6437007 heaven is not the default destination when you die you have to choose it jesus christ paid your way to heaven when he died on the cross for you but you must make your own choice to follow him

6437011 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill
6437012 hes having difficulties breathing and his flippers were at an unnatural angle
6437013 their advice to us was hes not going to last much longer hes suffering and you should take action
6437014 theyll need to locate it first and the poor little guy could have passed away in the night
6437015 once they figure out whats happened theyll take it from there
6437016 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard for
6437017 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work
6437018 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6437019 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6437020 get it into the vicinity of the other cow and calf and hopefully the cow would take on two calves which would be pretty unusual
6437021 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem
6437022 even if they are able to entice the calf out into open water it would face a higher predation pressure from sharks
6437023 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6437024 the key here is hes weakening hes losing the strength to get him fed and to a pod that will care for him

6437033 the overall survival detailed in the expanded fda approval of vidaza is extremely important for patients with higher risk mds a group with limited options and median survival of about 15 months with classical treatments
6437034 vidaza however is also effective across a broad range of mds subgroups including who classified aml patients the largest subgroup in our study
6437035 the clinical data from this randomized phase iii controlled study demonstrated that patients with higher risk mds treated with vidaza benefit from a significant survival advantage a critical measure of a drugs effectiveness
6437036 additionally the efficacy and safety profile of vidaza allows for long term therapy in patients with higher risk mds underscoring the ability to treat until disease progression for optimal survival benefit
6437037 this decision by the fda reflects the unprecedented survival advantage demonstrated by vidaza in patients with higher risk mds
6437038 vidaza is another example of celgene developing novel therapies for critical blood diseases that are enabling patients to live for years rather than weeks and months todays decision strengthens our companys ability to deliver vidaza and our other therapies to patients in need around the world
6437039 this study demonstrates the potential for personalized medicine combining selection of patients with a specific type of genetic mutation and a drug treatment that has been specifically designed to overcome that mutation
6437040 the publication of these ground breaking results in the lancet offers new hope to those patients with cf due to a nonsense mutation in the cftr gene and establishes a path forward for evaluating the efficacy and long term safety of ptc124
6437041 we are very pleased by this positive outcome from our ongoing collaboration with ptc
6437042 the development of ptc124 fits well with our strategic goal of supporting approaches that have the potential to modify the course of cf we are continuing to work together with ptc and the broader cf medical community to support the next steps in the evaluation of ptc124 for the clinical benefit for the treatment of nonsense mutation cf
6437043 the publication of these data provides clinical proof of concept in cf for the ptc124 mechanism of action in overcoming nonsense mutations as the basis for treating genetic disease
6437044 based on these results we intend to initiate a phase 2b study later this year to evaluate the clinical benefit of ptc124 in adults and children with nonsense mutation mediated cf given the potential applicability of ptc124 to multiple genetic disorders we have a pivotal study of ptc124 for nonsense mutation duchenne becker muscular dystrophy ongoing and are planning proof of concept studies in additional genetic disorders
6437045 effectiveness of ptc124 treatment of cystic fibrosis caused by nonsense mutations a prospective phase ii trial

6437068 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions

6437070 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress

6437109 getting in the water can help athletes move from good to gold
6437110 for 20 plus years water has been a part of our training weve seen less than one percent incidence rate of stress fractures and know that can be attributed to this kind of alternative training in the pool
6437111 as an example i personally coached mike miller two time olympic trials competitor in the 1500 800 and a sub four minute miler we used aquatic training with a huge degree of success with him
6437112 the athletic enhancement via aquatic exercise symposium is a unique forum for coaches and professional trainers who do not work in the aquatics field and are looking for new ways to enhance their athletes performance
6437113 we are excited to sponsor this first ever event slated for wednesday october 15th at the u s olympic training center colorado springs colorado
6437114 we are pleased to see many of our locations supporting such an important cause
6437115 we believe in the stewardship of share our strength and are honored to join the great american dine out for its inaugural year
6437116 the global credit crunch has tightened the availability of banking finance forcing investors in india and worldwide to reach out to private equity funds as an alternative source of funding their capital investment expansion programs despite indias recent weakened economic outlook and inflation at a 13 year high the infrastructure sector continues to attract global equity funds
6437117 additionally india is realizing increased interest from offshore money which will be invested into the national infrastructure program over the next five to seven years
6437118 the driving motivation for foreign direct investment inflows into india continues to be double tax treaties associated with offshore jurisdictions private equity funds establish wholly owned subsidiaries in offshore jurisdictions to invest into the indian target company
6437119 clients of walkers hong kong office have established special purpose vehicles spvs in the cayman islands and british virgin islands to operate as holding companies for investments into india these spvs typically invest into underlying indian investee companies via a wholly owned subsidiary established in a country that has a double tax treaty with india namely mauritius singapore or cyprus by creating an offshore holding structure the private equity fund may avoid transferability restrictions on an eventual exit from the underlying investment
6437120 private equity funds are extremely keen to identify and invest in growth opportunities in the indian pre ipo market this enthusiasm coupled with a lack of viable investment opportunities in other markets has made private equity financing an easier source of capital than financial institutions that are scaling back their lending activities in emerging markets
6437121 however private equitys insistence on taking quasi management positions within the investee companies can be perceived as an encroachment on the funded companys ability to independently control the growth and direction of the business this can often lead to a focus on short to medium term growth to facilitate an exit for the private equity fund not longer term strategies
6437122 while india does present some challenges due to the strict restrictions of the indian companies act 1956 and the material regulatory barriers if a fund investing in india is not a member of iosco we anticipate continued interest in india and more activity from india investors
6437123 by working with a sophisticated law firm that has vast experience both in private equity funds and in the asian markets institutional investors and global financial organizations can leverage the power of this emerging market
6437124 work with others towards conclusion of a multilateral fissile material cut off treaty fmct

6437129 the iphone is an interesting device and it is great to see other companies also share our vision of connected multimedia devices

6437139 we will be part of the meeting among other steel producers
6437140 we have reason to believe that tripathi enjoyed the patronage of some high ups in the bank who allowed him to have a field day in domariyaganj
6437141 the matter is under investigation so i am not going to give you anything on the issue i cannot even tell you how much currency has so far been found to be fake
6437142 sustained interrogation of abid sheikh alias pundit who was among the arrested people gave our cops the leads to sbi bank cashier sudhakar tripathi
6437143 i am told that rbi is supposed to carry out inspection and scanning of all currency chests every six months
6437144 after all so many crores tens of millions worth of fake notes could not have been replaced from the currency chest overnight

6437227 he works for the taxation department in brisbane and he took a 12 month leave of absence to take a six month contract teaching english there
6437228 hes just finished that and he was just starting his planned travels he was heading through laos and that is where he came to grief
6437229 from what we know he went to visit a waterfall which was only an hour hike from where he was staying and discovered there were two waterfalls so he went on to see the second one
6437230 then there was a sudden downpour of tropical rain and he was in a jungle area where there are very few tracks and the dreadful downpour just washed away all signs of the tracks that were there and he became lost
6437231 the people where he had his lodgings did organise a search party but they went to the wrong waterfall and were not aware he had gone on to the second one
6437232 eventually they sent up a helicopter and discovered him and sent the ground crews there
6437233 hayden apparently had been able to leave a message by building his name out of rocks to identify himself and his direction of travel
6437234 he saved his own life in a way because the ground crews were able to find him quicker because of that message the helicopter was only able to give a general area
6437235 when they found him he was lying on his back and had been unable to move for three days he laid there like that in the pouring rain attacked by flies and mosquitoes attacked by nasty bugs he was scratched from head to toe
6437236 they put a phone to his ear and i was able to talk to him
6437237 i asked him how he was going and he started to tell me he had gone for a one hour walk and it took three hours and then they stopped him from talking he was delirious and not making a lot of sense
6437238 hes a bachelor and he had the wanderlust he has lived and worked in england for a couple of years worked in most states of australia hes travelled through europe hes been to africa as well america and last year he took five months off and went and bummed around south america
6437239 hayden is lucky in a way he is a non smoker and he doesnt take drugs or anything like that
6437240 hes a surfer and walks regularly so whilst he is not a super athlete he is fairly fit and we are hoping that his good living will help him pull through this

6437279 we pull all that information before they get here and give it to the doctors and the nurses
6437280 its basically a briefing before the patient gets here so we all know what their condition is before they arrive
6437281 the mcc is one of the largest factors in getting the mission together
6437282 they deal with all the logistics and numbers and make sure the patients get on the right flights they do all of the channeling of information to the medical technicians and make sure everyone gets on the missions theyre supposed to

6437301 another movie he directed brainstorm was originally designed to highlight a projection technology he was promoting the movie was about recording experiences in the film the recorded experiences were going to be played at 48 frames per second as opposed to the standard 24 frames per second his feeling was that audiences had gotten used to the look of standard film people were subliminally aware of the 24 frame per second flicker by projecting the film at twice the standard rate the flicker was harder to perceive and the film would be given that much more immediacy however it was impossible to convince the theater owners to install the special projectors to show the recorded experience sequences the movie was released as a conventional film fortunately the story stood up well on its own partly correct showscan runs at 60fps when he was doing test work for 2001 i believe it was on the spacewalk footage but its been years since i read up on the process and things have blurred for me he accidentally ran a sequence at 60fps and the uniform reaction in the booth was shock that hed gotten a 3d effect with a conventional camera he did dream up brainstorm to use the process but the studio hed been working with didnt want to install the only projector on the market that would run 60fps for an extended period without breaking for just one film and he ended up taking the story idea with him to mgm as i remember it he had to do a sizable payout to get it from his previous studio even then mgm wouldnt go for it compare and contrast with the ua chain which installed a highly sophisticated 3d system in a number of their theaters including seattle and ended up offering a couple of million dollars as a bounty to get someone anyone to shoot a feature using it there were several showscan shorts shot the one at expo 86 the one on magic tricks starring christopher lee and it looked like hed finally get them in widespread distribution when he signed a deal with a major restaurant chain to add a showscan theater to each of their restaurants but the chain was chuck e cheese and the deal was about two months before they imploded of all the reviews i read about the process the one that stuck with me was the one in cinefantastique that said makeup technology was going to have to improve greatly if the process was going to catch on you could apparently see every pore on christopher lees face

6437347 there is an allegation made by any newspaper any newspaper writes anything about anybody
6437348 the day after that the company that is alleged to have given the president of south africa r30 million the company that is alleged to have done so issues a statement in its own country denying that it has ever paid that amount of money to any south african
6437349 where is the evidence that can actually be tested in our courts
6437350 i think that to continue to make allegations against the president of our country when we cannot take him to court and place evidence there undermines the standing of this country internationally and actually makes a clown of this whole sitting here that we can actually bring those stories here when theres no evidence of any kind
6437351 we made those documents public we opened defence the investigators could come in and look at the documents save that they couldnt take them away but they could examine any document
6437352 expulsion would at least serve the purpose of sparing these two victims the trauma
6437353 if you do not spend time with your children someone or something else will
6437354 we have a group of detectives who are in the process of exposing more and more detectives to the investigation of harmful religious practices
6437355 if there is not a crime involved there is religious freedom
6437356 they start to reject everything that is moral coming from their school and their parents they think they are on a higher level in a relationship with some kind of supernatural deity
6437357 they take this very literally so the vengeance issue becomes very active
6437358 lets face it it is a religion of the flesh
6437359 there is no cyber prohibition children are curious and start exploring these things
6437360 it starts with white magic it goes to gateway religious systems and then to destructive religions it is pretty prevalent
6437361 i wont go as far as to say it leads to that kind of violence generally
6437362 in most cases it boils down to an emotional need
6437363 they often knew the different religions and belief systems very well but had chosen to follow the route of satanism
6437364 there is a clear message that in our families we must get back to basics we must start loving our children and guiding them there is absolute carte blanche in a great deal of homes where children have no borders at all
6437365 i am going to sing about aids and i am going to sing about drug abuse and the things that are happening out there
6437366 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6437367 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6437368 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6437369 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6437370 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6437371 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6437372 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
6437373 why dont you tie a kerosene soaked rag around your ankles so the ants wont climb up and eat your candy ass
6437374 website design eh do you use a computer for that

6437377 apple craves good news so im sure they arent too happy to read about the random connection problems around the world with the iphone 3g
6437378 although estimates about the number of users affected are usually in the low single digits with millions of units out there little things can mean an awful lot
6437379 of course we are concerned about the fans however any disappointment from the core fans should not be directed toward fox what we are doing is seeking to enforce our distribution rights to watchmen legal copyright ownership should not just be swept under the rug and ignored

6437385 this is a solid set of results particularly when viewed against a backdrop of far fewer blockbuster films in the period and an increasingly challenging consumer environment
6437386 the enduring appeal of film continues to be even more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty and we feel confident that the strong line up of films in the second half will drive admissions particularly in the fourth quarter when james bond quantum of solace madagascar 2 and high school musical 3 hit our screens
6437387 i sat there on the clerk side johnson was formerly an assistant public defender and noticed how bored the jurors were
6437388 they would be ordered to go and leave and stand around and i thought you know if they had a cookie they would visit and they did
6437389 it was good to see people be ok with being there because they were killing time and they were visiting youre going to visit with people when youve got a cup of coffee water a cookie something to eat they were able to talk to somebody who they normally would not have without it

6437394 they then get thrown of the ride then sucked into a vortex next a sign saying black kids pops up then reggie starts singing whilst on a rock then you see 2 dears go by
6437395 then it goes up into an animated space where you see 2 of them in a animated space ship then you see the two girls singing on a yellow cube then the black kids do other things such as racing in cars
6437396 dancing witha guitar flying in space standing on a building fighting in space fighting against a evil skeleton

6437399 and also very difficult with both high speed corners and some blind corners to make life complicated our car was really good here last year and we raced quite easily in the end its the type of circuit where you need to have very good car balance to trust the handling in the high speed corners
6437400 it took a while to learn the track last year because of the blind corners and the high speeds most of them are fourth or fifth gear corners
6437401 the differences between the two types of motors have both construction implications and mechanical environmental how the motorcycle is driven as well as construction and maintenance cost issues mechanically the two stroke engine is simple the piston with its alternating motion opens and closes the ports of the intake and exhaust from which the mixture of air petrol and oil and exhaust gases enters and leaves in comparison the four stroke motor is complex and heavier than its two stroke equivalent the upper part of the engine is the head which holds the intake and exhaust valves driven by camshafts engine power comes from petrol shot into the engine via injectors the lubrication of the two strokes engine crankshaft and connecting rods is entrusted to the fuel the power is normally governed by a carburettor that has a mechanical operation typically controlled by the depression created by the movement of the piston the lubrication of the various mechanisms of the four strokes is entrusted to oil and this can be collected in a reservoir built in the lower part of the engine called a sump which can either be a dry or wet sump depending on whether the oil is collected in a separate tank

6437414 reunion ought to take place in such wise as to preserve our good faith in our brethren and each other it is our duty to guard the memory of our deceased bishops meade otey and especially our beloved polk the slaveholding bishop who died on the battlefield as a confederate general not that we should expect any endorsement from the general convention of their views and actions but that we should feel assured that no reproach either direct or implied will be cast upon their graves the reputation of the dead is in our keeping and we can fraternize with nobody who would willingly disturb their ashes they have lived and died for us and however wrong others may think them we revere their memory and weep over their graves
6437415 the church should desire to maintain and uphold the self respect of all its members remembering that they are the body of christ in this way we shall become in our reunion the admiration of the country as we were for so many years during the fierce wrangling which preceded secession its wonder for our reticence and self control
6437416 was in every way tempted as we are yet did not sin
6437417 i think any republican in this country who was asked by the nominee of our party to be their running mate would consider it an enormous honor and would accept that and do it with pleasure and pride

6437425 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
6437426 we urge beneficiaries to choose wisely when selecting their drug coverage
6437427 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress
6437428 convening parliament is a violation is a repudiation of some of the conditions
6437429 president mugabe will not proceed to do anything unilaterally that any step that we take has to be by consensus
6437430 if president mugabe proceeds to convene parliament appoint a new cabinet it means that he is proceeding to violate the conditions which means that he may have abandoned the basis for the talks but we dont know what his intentions are
6437431 that while negotiations are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held
6437432 how do you share not only responsibility but also authority over government
6437433 how do you distinguish between head of state and head of government without necessarily defining anyone as ceremonial it is not envisaged that the president becomes ceremonial on the other hand it is not envisaged that you have got a ceremonial prime minister
6437434 it is that balance that is necessary to establish and i think thats where the outstanding issue is
6437435 were investing in viddix because its tool is a valueable contribution to existing webvideo services we foresee a good role for this tool in the future of online video

6437446 i dont have many games to go for australia and this will be a biggie
6437447 kings park absa stadium is my favourite ground theres a great atmosphere so im looking forward to it
6437448 i dont have any regrets about leaving im 32 now and ive made the right decision to go
6437449 this opportunity to start is just a bonus first and foremost i would just like play well on saturday
6437450 ill just be taking it one step at a time i was a little surprised to be a part of the squad taking into account my age and that im heading overseas to play rugby
6437451 but its been really great just to be involved again
6437452 the first thing that the team myself included have noticed is the competitive energy at training
6437453 everything we do in training is super competitive and i think that goes a long way into transferring what we do behind closed doors on to the field
6437454 he deans leaves a lot to the players he expects them based on their accountability to add where they can to their own performance
6437455 there are no strict guidelines to follow as far as making sure we know how to do things but you do feel obliged that you make sure you know how to do them
6437456 i think his leadership has been integral in how far weve played this season especially in winning those first five test matches
6437457 i suppose its just one of those things ive been used to in the past
6437458 at test level when i look back to when i had my first run on back in 2000 that was probably in between four and five months of playing football
6437459 its the nature we have in australia in that theres not much rugby played between tests and the super 14 and again last year against canada at the world cup when i got my cap that day there wasnt a lot of rugby played from the last time i took to the field
6437460 but its something i have a lot of experience with and there definitely isnt a lot of concern from robbie or myself
6437461 ive been training well and obviously been involved with the test squad for the last eight or nine weeks so its a challenge im really looking forward to
6437462 if you look back the world cup last year i thought he was the player of the tournament the way he directed the springboks around was fantastic
6437463 i know hes only just coming back from injury but hes one of the players that you have to watch very carefully on the field
6437464 bok half backs like joost van der westhuizen and fourie du preez are the kind of guys that when they play well the team plays well fourie doesnt have to rely on his pack to play well he turns his forwards around and makes sure they perform
6437465 we just want to make sure we do the job at hand first
6437466 we really want to win this game as well as perform well and show that we can win overseas
6437467 its our understanding that hes arrived in bangkok he will either try to go somewhere else or come back to the uk
6437468 the viva la vida sessions were incredibly fruitful they gelled brilliantly with brian and recorded much more music than they could fit on one album
6437469 the majority of the follow up is already in the can though they will have to go back into the studio at some point to add a few more songs
6437470 we would be observing a two day nationwide strike on september 24 and 25 employees from all public sector banks will participate in the strike
6437471 it is the prerogative of the lawyers body to take such decision as debarring an advocate
6437472 the coordination committee of all bar associations of delhi strongly feels that the directions issued by the delhi high court debarring the two senior advocates from practising in delhi courts for a period of four months is beyond the jurisdictional competence of the high court
6437473 this was violation of code of conduct to threaten a scribe while the inquiry is yet going on

6437477 ja es ist das beladenste aller menschenworte keines ist so besudelt so zerfetzt worden gerade deshalb darf ich darauf nicht verzichten wir d rfen es nicht preiseben wie gut l t sich verstehen da manche vorschlagen eine zeit ber von den letzten dingen zu schweigen damit die mi brauchten worte erl st werden aber so sind sie nicht zu erl sen wir k nnen das wort gott nicht reinwaschen und wir k nnen es nicht ganzmachen aber wir k nnen es befleckt und zerfetzt wie es ist vom boden erheben und aufrichten ber einer stunde gro er sorge
6437478 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
6437479 they reveal that obama is ignorant of facts and history misunderstands the constitution and contradicts himself in his own alleged criteria for supreme court nominees
6437480 first of all i think justice clarence thomas is one of the best appointments that have been made by republican presidents or any presidents for that matter in recent times
6437481 recognized the relationship between the declaration of independence and the constitution that the constitution is a means of indicating the inalienable rights that are traceable to our creator
6437482 the senator is a big boy and can take care of himself
6437483 forty eight percent of our credit losses were from four states california arizona nevada and florida these states saw the most dramatic run up in prices and are now seeing the most rapid declines
6437484 so the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
6437485 some signs do offer rays of positive light foreclosures actually fell in michigan same period home sales were up in california and as the government sponsored entities provide most of the liquidity to the primary market that market is functioning and a safe center of credit risk pricing and product is being restored
6437486 san jose were the worst team id seen since the league started looking north of la for an expansion team
6437487 you know its those pigs over on suncrest theyre probably buying half the truck
6437488 there are no heroes in sports athletes today are often referred to as heroes or warriors when in reality theyre neither
6437489 he specialist oneal the soldier closest to pat when he was killed tells the committee the statement he gave was changed without his consent the inspector generals investigation uncovered that staff sergeant matt weeks statement was also altered
6437490 pat wanted to leave a positive legacy and he did
6437491 for the government to hijack his virtue and legacy is horrific
6437492 the tragic truth can only fall somewhere between screw up and cover up between rampant incompetence and elaborate conspiracy
6437493 if they bring a knife to the fight we bring a gun
6437494 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6437495 not about ego self aggrandizement getting their name in the press

6437500 a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men
6437501 every moment is a golden one for him who has the vision to recognize it as such
6437502 i am calling on investors and organisations around the world to come forward and surprise us with startling ideas that can preserve the memory of the games while creating a new focus for londons eastward growth
6437503 we are looking for ideas of how londons olympic park can become not just a great place to live work and visit but a place that retains a flavour of the extraordinary a place with the wow factor a place of magic
6437504 we are cleaning up the land burying overhead power lines upgrading roads and railways and installing new energy infrastructure
6437505 we are delivering for 2012 but planning for the long term
6437506 i think i speak for millions of people in the uk when i say weve been dazzled weve been impressed weve been blown away by the beijing games but weve not been intimidated
6437507 i think that with our native wit our gift for pageantry and our fantastic ingenuity it is possible in london we will produce even though we have a lower population base and we dont have the resources to throw at it a fantastic opening ceremony and a fantastic olympic games
6437508 i want to make sure children in london whose families are paying an extra 20 a year in council tax will be able to see the games
6437509 by 2012 london will be a city transformed by investment from government the private sector but also from other countries attracted to the ambition and potential of london
6437510 thats why we are setting a target for foreign investment to be driven by londons status as a host city this is a unique opportunity we will not waste it
6437511 we want to ensure that the legacy development of the olympic park captures any truly exceptional ground breaking ideas from around the world
6437512 the new contract will deliver a quality approach to council housing maintenance with the focus firmly on improving tenant satisfaction and customer service the tenants forum has been fully involved in the selection process ensuring that our new contractor has a clear picture of tenants expectations for the service right from the start and caradons determination to see those expectations met
6437513 we are delighted to have been awarded this contract and look forward to working with caradons tenants it is particularly pleasing to have the endorsement from the tenants forum as we have a strong belief in high quality customer service and are fully committed to getting it right the first time

6437515 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
6437516 i just got out of bed couldnt this flying lesson wait until later
6437517 it was amazing how much cash was coming in and also how fast we were spending it
6437518 i hung out with the beautiful people and i felt very inadequate
6437519 like i wasnt up to their level like the people were going to find out i was a fraud
6437520 one of my lowest points was being homeless and living in the new york city subway system in the tunnels and not being able to see my children
6437521 i didnt realize that man makes the money money doesnt make the man
6437522 i dont have a lot of extra i pay my bills but its tough
6437523 i wouldnt mind having the money that i had back then but i definitely dont want the lifestyle im so much happier with the way that i am now
6437524 i thought im just going to buy some lottery tickets and see what happens
6437525 ive been hurt many times by people that i thought were friends
6437526 a lot of my friends from new york i do not speak to anymore and i have two brothers that dont talk to me anymore
6437527 i do wish that i bought the milk sometimes because i wouldnt have half the headaches that i have now
6437528 i wish i was poor old amy back in new york where everybody just liked me for me and they didnt look at me with dollar signs in their eyes
6437529 i wish i wouldnt have done the media thing i should have kept the news to myself
6437530 there was so much grief and emotion that went with the situation that i just let it go
6437531 a gente vai entrar em campo na retranca mas sabe se l deus como vamos ganhar
6437532 h quantos anos a nossa sele o vem nos decepcionando
6437533 what do i ask of a painting i ask it to astonish disturb seduce and convince
6437534 this is the next frontier in assuring workplaces are safe
6437535 unless some kind of miracle happens i dont see it
6437536 its not just for me but for the people you drive
6437537 we feel our health benefits and sick leave benefits are competitive and we feel good about it
6437538 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
6437539 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
6437540 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality
6437541 theres been some concern that employees are abusing the ordinance theres been a little bit of that but not as widespread as people thought at the beginning
6437542 if you look at the last decade theres been an incredible growth of these programs
6437543 show this card at any participating orlando area exxon station to get your free save the tiger poster
6437544 if you look at the numbers the average us household belongs to 12 different loyalty programs but they only use about a third of them
6437545 that means that there is just so much money being invested into these loyalty programs that just sort of fall out of the wallet or end up in the sock drawer to never be used again
6437546 if i make an investment in this program at the end of the day is it going to make me more money
6437547 people dont tend to forget to carry around their credit card but theyll leave most of those 12 loyalty cards at home
6437548 how about combining the two and making it easier for consumers
6437549 the interest that weve seen from the credit card companies they are all very interested in this
6437550 so we know were on to something here and i think theyre looking at us and saying wow this is really the next evolution for consumers
6437551 what were seeing is really more of a trend of hey i usually go to three or four coffee shops if i consolidate my business then maybe ill get a free cup of coffee a week and that really adds up a couple dollars a week especially in this economy is important
6437552 i was angry with my people i have given them into your hand you showed them no mercy you who say in your heart

6437573 now there are ghosts everywhere and they wont leave me alone to top it all off i somehow got myself locked up in lyle house a special home for troubled teens yet the home isnt what it seems dont tell anyone but i think there might be more to my housemates than meets the eye the question is whose side are they on its up to me to figure out the dangerous secrets behind lyle house before its skeletons come back to haunt me
6437574 thats when i fired him but it had taken me two years to do it two years of agonizing over my decision only later did i learn that this same agent did the same thing to a far more prominent internationally bestselling author to the tune of millions of dollars so as a victim i was in good company
6437575 the first question describe yourself in a single word as you are right now second question describe the person you want to be the point these words are the beginning an end of the story what comes in between how do you get from where you are to where you want to be

6437579 personally i trust our designers and their vision and love working with them on cover designs in some cases i have an idea of what i want the cover to look like but oftentimes ill wait and see what the designer comes up with first so as not to taint their creativity
6437580 most agents will jump on the opportunity to consider a proposal that is currently under consideration with a major house be wary though because
6437581 picture books can be used with reluctant ya readers and visual learners they can be paired with novels or nonfiction works in history lessons they can initiate art and design projects draw on art historical connections and critical thinking strategies and rekindle the personal experience with literature
6437582 the world that crissa jean chappell experiences is far from ordinary we hear cuban tree frogs she hears puppies barking we see a classroom with circular windows she sees a ship we smell an orchid she smells maple syrup eggs and bacon
6437583 hope feels so fragile sometimes in the publishing world whether an editor or agent likes your manuscript is so subjective they can be having a bad day when your query lands on their desk or in box or the subject matter might be something that turns them off or touches something they dont want to look at
6437584 i think this is a three way street an author shouldnt be expected to buy a gift for her author or her agent an agent shouldnt be expected to buy a gift for an author or an editor these are things we should do if we want to

6437620 our goal in designing cruze was to be bold not evolutionary
6437621 we wanted to take a big step forward making a strong design statement for chevrolet products around the world
6437622 we are proud that europe is leading the introduction for this global product
6437623 chevrolet has always stood for expressive value and cruze delivers on that promise like never before it further redefines chevrolet with its design quality materials and great style inside and out the fit and finish for gaps and interfaces sets a new standard for this segment in europe and around the world

6437637 they were found by a specialist volunteer who helps us clean the statuary in cliveden
6437638 he went to a talk at the local archaeological society given by a snail specialist mentioned his find and it turned out hed spotted the colony which had almost certainly been there since 1896
6437639 it was purchased and brought over from rome by the first viscount astor
6437640 hed been an ambassador in rome and was a great collector the villa borghese in rome which he bought it from now has a copy
6437641 what theyre doing what theyre eating we dont rightly know although its likely theyre feeding on lichen or algae growing on the marble
6437642 but whats important is theyve also been found in two possibly three other places at cliveden so all our eggs are not in one basket from a conservation point of view

6437671 what most people fail to realise is that an abnormal weather situation caused the extreme thaw in 2007 one cannot presume that a similar abnormal situation will repeat itself this year
6437672 it is still possible that the north pole will be ice free this summer but it is not probable
6437673 the wind could blow the ice in a particular direction and that would give you an ice free north pole even though there would be quite a lot of ice in the arctic sea it wouldnt surprise me if that happened within ten years
6437674 i have absolutely no idea whether that makes any sense from a scientific from a practical point of view
6437675 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6437676 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6437677 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6437678 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6437679 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6437680 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6437681 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6437682 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6437683 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6437684 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6437685 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6437686 and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6437687 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6437688 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible
6437689 the investor class is buying back oil as a hedge because the value of the dollar is weak
6437690 all else equal people would think that in a stable commodity market and a negative financial market people would have more faith in the commodity place
6437691 if the dollar does fall off a lot of these guys foreign investors are able to consume more and buy more on a pure dollar per dollar basis
6437692 running back to gold running back to oil so it seems we are seeing some of the running back to safe haven
6437693 running back to oil is a hedge against this risk again
6437694 the risk factors are back on the rise with the latest fears about fannie mae and freddie mac and that seems to have captured the imagination of the market
6437695 the reason why gas supplies are so tight is because refineries are not making any demand is not there
6437696 the summer driving season is coming to an end and if the refineries chose to they could ramp up the production of gas because they have plenty of crude but there is no desire to ramp up
6437697 we are going up for the same reasons we went to the highs concerns about the dollar the economy the feds ability to raise interest rates
6437698 it looks like we could potentially test the 120 area that would be the big number that everybody would be looking at
6437699 there would have to be another event to push it that much higher whether that would be the dollar breakdown or an additional uprising with russia arms buildup in poland
6437700 i think you would have to have something a bit out of the ordinary to get there
6437701 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6437702 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6437703 if it is possible as far as it depends on you
6437704 ok so i tried again and ended up almost immediately with this
6437705 it is not just this game where there have been problems there have been other games and there will be problems in the future that will occur
6437706 we need to sit down and address it and address it very quickly otherwise it stays around the squad
6437707 on the next trip weve got 10 days away and if we can address it before those two games and thrash things out before the world cup campaign starts we will be okay
6437708 we are still encouraged by what we can do in zagreb
6437709 against the czechs we wanted to do better than we did but at the same time there will be points to be played for with andorra and croatia hopefully we can get off to a good start and win against andorra and take the confidence to croatia we have to go there and stand up and be counted for

6437748 even now nobody comes to visit me at my house because i have hiv
6437749 my church has isolated me and left me by myself
6437750 there are a few people who know but i havent shared with anybody because i am afraid
6437751 the hiv pandemic remains the most serious of infectious disease challenges to public health
6437752 as you meet here in the archdiocese of atlanta you have to realize that if you are going to pursue the sheep that is lost it is going to cost you
6437753 there are big gaps there are large numbers of people who fall into those gaps
6437754 the church was there long before hiv came on the scene and some day hopefully well have a solution and the church will be there long after probably responding to lots of other emergencies as well
6437755 the church has lasting values it is based on lasting values and it communicates those values it must remind people of their responsibilities for themselves and to others
6437756 havent yet touched the hearts and minds and actions of the people of god
6437757 we need to do the hard homework of forming our conscience
6437758 some people will say we are not talking about life preventing we are talking about life preserving
6437759 is this a different kind of reality ought we be thinking in new ways i think that remains a challenge especially for the official church
6437760 profound strength of a holistic approach to life and therefore to hiv and aids
6437761 its important that we teach our students about hiv aids in our catholic schools where else would you want it talked about
6437762 our inner strengths experiences and truths cannot be lost destroyed or taken away every person has an inborn worth and can contribute to the human community we all can treat one another with dignity and respect provide opportunities to grow toward our fullest lives and help one another discover and develop our unique gifts we each deserve this and we all can extend it to others

6437773 microsoft corp weary of being cast as a stodgy oldster by apple inc s advertising is turning for help to jerry seinfeld
6437774 the software giants new 300 million advertising campaign devised by a newly hired ad agency has been closely guarded but mr seinfeld will be one of the key celebrity pitchmen say people close to the situation he will appear with microsoft chairman bill gates in ads and receive about 10 million for the work they say
6437775 the new ad effort is expected to use some variation of the slogan windows not walls according to several people familiar with the matter those people say the point is to stress breaking down barriers that prevent people and ideas from connecting the campaign said to debut sept 4 is one of the largest in the companys history
6437776 the attempted image overhaul comes as microsoft executives privately acknowledge that windows the companys most important brand has grown stale and has been battered by apples mac vs pc ads
6437777 microsofts immediate goal is to reverse the negative public perception of windows vista the latest version of the companys personal computer operating system
6437778 while apples digs at microsoft through its advertising campaign have been vexing apple is on a hot streak with its products that microsoft hasnt been able to match during the second quarter apple said it sold 41 more macs than it did during the same period the prior year that compares with growth of 15 3 in total pc shipments world wide according to idc apples desktop and notebook computers have won converts among onetime windows loyalists

6437861 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain in the body
6437862 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population
6437863 however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
6437864 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp 7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity

6437933 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6437934 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6437935 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6437936 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6437937 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6437938 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6437939 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6437940 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6437941 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6437942 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6437943 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6437944 and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6437945 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6437946 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible

6437965 although there was enough rainfall this spring to keep the trees healthy we are still in drought conditions in the western part of the state which surprisingly is good for fall color
6437966 this year the trees should be on a more typical color schedule peaking in mid october in the mountains
6437967 and a sharp cooling of temperatures in september and october would really cause the colors to burst as this stimulates the production of anthocyanin or red pigments

6438084 hes a showboat a hot dog and a clown the sprinting version of chad johnson and terrell owens all those things that cause bob costas and the purists to cringe and thank god for that by the way because if it wasnt for the show business flair of usain bolt we merely would know him as that fast guy who became the first man ever to break world records in the 100 and 200 meters at the same olympics instead the lightning bolt is the new rage of sports saving the summer games from post phelps yawns and creating a new delicious debate that is are his antics un olympian and discourteous to his beaten rivals or is he just delightful
6438085 there are things i never expected to see in my lifetime i never expected to see anyone win eight gold medals in a single olympics i never expected to see a jukebox the size of an ipod i never expected to see a man hit more than 70 home runs in a season i never expected to see yet another batman movie sweep america more than any of that though i never expected to see a human being run faster than michael johnson did under a snowstorm of camera flashes on a muggy august night in atlanta a dozen years ago

6438091 the goal of the agreement after the un secretary general proposed unmik reconfiguration is to hand over some equipment to eulex because of that we can be very precise and say that it is not a political agreement nor is it tied to kosovos status and is only about technical equipment that eulex is taking over
6438092 we need time to set everything up the process will begin in the coming weeks and we need time because we have to deploy 2000 international experts and that will take us three to four months at this moment in time we will not be fully deployed realistically because there could be problems in some areas and we will have to work slowly there step by step because i do not want to force people to accept eulex

6438100 as the executive cannot decide the question of war on the affirmative side neither ought it to do so on the negative side by preventing the competent body from deliberating on the question

6438104 the russians have driven us from our homes and now we end up as refugees here in a building that used to be the base for russian soldiers serving in the caucasus it is an irony of fate
6438105 things are not so bad here but we all just want to go home as soon as the russians leave
6438106 we escaped with our car and left everything else behind this is my lovely house we dont know if or when we will see it again
6438107 we had to leave my mother in law behind she is 80 we dont even know if she is still alive
6438108 we dont know if our house is still standing because everybody in our village fled

6438120 the national sales figures do not tell the whole story
6438121 indeed our recent survey of agents records some stability returning to the market in the number of sales agreed the number of viewings before a sale is secured and the average difference between asking and sales price
6438122 more weak economic news added to the gathering momentum of negative sentiment about the housing market
6438123 a further fall in house prices in may was not unexpected and for most of those not wishing to move house or borrow money secured on it the fall in value of their home is likely to be of limited concern in the short term
6438124 while there was a small month on month increase in activity it represented a notable decline from a year ago

6438141 hoje eu montei mais tranq ila sem responsabilidade s de chegar aqui foi uma vit ria foi uma surpresa grande este resultado foi um presente de deus
6438142 i know that families up and down the country are feeling the impact in the cost of filling up at the petrol station and in the rise in gas and electricity bills
6438143 in den zwei jahren die er hier war konnte er seine eigenen und unsere anspr che nicht erf llen
6438144 britains borders are stronger than ever with asylum applications at an historic low and an immigration offender removed every eight minutes
6438145 foreign lawbreakers are being removed from britain at record levels with more than 2 500 deported so far this year
6438146 i have made it repeatedly clear that people who come here must earn the right to stay work hard and play by the rules
6438147 the fall in registrations from eastern eastern europe is welcome news for our hard pressed public services but other government statistics publishes today show that immigration as a whole continues on a rising trend
6438148 net immigration reached nearly 200 000 in the year to mid 2007
6438149 it seems that the immigration tide is turning just because we have had high immigration over the last 10 years doesnt mean the next 10 years will be the same
6438150 as fewer eastern europeans arrive asylum numbers fall and there is reduced demand for migrant workers we would expect the nature of migration flows to change
6438151 the challenge in the next few years will be to attract enough migrant workers with the right skills who can drive economic growth in the uk
6438152 people from eastern europe dont have to register with the government when they enter the country for at least three months during which time they can disappear
6438153 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill
6438154 hes having difficulties breathing and his flippers were at an unnatural angle
6438155 their advice to us was hes not going to last much longer hes suffering and you should take action
6438156 theyll need to locate it first and the poor little guy could have passed away in the night
6438157 once they figure out whats happened theyll take it from there
6438158 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard for
6438159 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work
6438160 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6438161 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6438162 get it into the vicinity of the other cow and calf and hopefully the cow would take on two calves which would be pretty unusual
6438163 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem
6438164 even if they are able to entice the calf out into open water it would face a higher predation pressure from sharks
6438165 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6438166 the key here is hes weakening hes losing the strength to get him fed and to a pod that will care for him
6438167 i honor his service i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6438168 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6438169 you think you can win by taking the higher ground i worry about you
6438170 i have no doubt over the last eight weeks given some of the media articles we have suffered brand damage
6438171 that people read something and say this but a few days later they say well we understand that qantas has a great reputation
6438172 theres a perception now being created of a lot more problems with qantas than there is in reality
6438173 we undergo as an airline close to 150 audits a year
6438174 these reports show the most comprehensive picture of nhs dentistry to date under the new contractual arrangements
6438175 as a qualified dentist myself it is interesting to see how a typical course of dental treatment is changing
6438176 our challenge is encouraging people to visit their dentist for regular check ups even if they feel they dont need to
6438177 there is also a perception amongst the public that there is a growing lack of nhs dentists and these latest statistics prove that there is actually more and more nhs dentistry services opening around the country
6438178 those that are able to access care are confronted with a system that discourages modern preventive care by placing targets rather than patients at its heart
6438179 the apparent change in treatment patterns is also of concern and requires further investigation so that the impact of the new contract is fully understood
6438180 ministers need to stop dithering admit that their new dental contract has been a complete failure and take action to make good their pledge to give everyone access to an nhs dentist
6438181 we had been discussing a viral campaign for three or four months now placing some stuff on the net so some of this was just wacky timing
6438182 the whole concept behind our campaign was that we wanted people to be looking at our web site while they were thinking they were looking at someone elses
6438183 and when i think about how it might affect fall out boy all i can say is that petes a clever bloke and he probably wouldve done the same thing had he thought of it
6438184 i mean think about it the two campaigns are very similar theirs is supposed to look like an ominous organization thats mucking around the way the two campaigns crossed didnt hurt anyone
6438185 the whole idea was mocking other sites and if life went according to plan you wouldve seen that continue instead it got ripped to shreds overnight
6438186 but like i said this wasnt done maliciously and everything ive heard about pete is that hes a marketing kind of guy hes the king of making people talk and ruffling feathers so he wouldve done the same thing if he could have so if fall out boy fans are mad about this whole thing well all i can say is that pete wouldve done the same thing

6438195 wir werden noch zwei bis drei monate erfreuliche zahlen am arbeitsmarkt haben dann werden sich die schleifspuren der nachlassenden konjunktur am arbeitsmarkt bemerkbar machen

6438198 wir gehen nicht davon aus dass sich der arbeitsmarkt vollkommen von der konjunkturentwicklung abkoppeln kann

6438206 i want to finish my career here and im going to do everything possible to make that happen
6438207 theyre in a tough situation right now with the team stuff so we dont want to push anything
6438208 our situation is a lot worse than advertised and we need to start making some tough choices if we want our future to be better than our past

6438210 weve got a super subprime crisis brewing namely the federal governments finances
6438211 the factors that caused the mortgage based subprime crisis to explode exist for the governments finances the difference is its 25 times at least bigger

6438217 we came up with the idea during a brainstorm while trying to find solutions for combining toys and furniture home accessories
6438218 just bear in mind this is a livelihood of our players and our players have been training very hard for the last four years and what they are waiting for is this day i really feel disappointed someone will have to be accountable for this
6438219 she wasnt too bad shes back now and shes settled in well
6438220 i was very worried that she would be hit by a car or even worse cause a serious accident
6438221 she made a run for it on the other side of the road towards the esso garage
6438222 if she had managed to get away she could be anywhere by now as far as the sally gap
6438223 im delighted shes back home shes grand now she wasnt injured but shes had a very stressful day
6438224 to succeed here you really do have to believe it will happen and really see yourself being able to do it but the reality is theres a lot of great people out there trying to get the same thing and its not likely to happen youre going against the odds to be able to pull it off
6438225 you dont talk about that ahead of time and because of that some athletes who are great at believing dont really have a plan b and they dont have a gracious response to it because its something they havent prepared for
6438226 if i had competed in group a i would have won the gold my competitors were chasing my kilos
6438227 the interesting part is how we deal with these things its going to happen and how do you deal with it the ioc has put down clear rules regarding the medals i think that is a very strong message thats kind of reinforcing what we believe in acting on the best values of sports
6438228 what is the larger applicability of this openess will it forever be confined to a green patch here or will it be broadened throughout the country i think unless you want to forever keep this as a symbol or as an excuse you need to be genuine about liberalisation and apply it to the country as a whole
6438229 we would prefer to have some events at a venue that means something to us so when we were organising the myanmar peace awareness day it was a student effort and we wanted to hold it on campus so to say that we could hold it here i dont think it makes much sense
6438230 visibility is very important people want to be seen and they want to be seen in a group to show that there is some weight in public opinion behind a certain measure or against a certain measure so to confine people to the speakers corner might defeat the purpose
6438231 i think you might recall that some time back workers party applied for a permit to hold a mass cycling event to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the party it was turned down and we were told to cycle in a stadium and i think that just defeats the purpose of such an activity i think the question is is this step too much of a baby step
6438232 i see some people playing soccer here for recreation other than that i dont really know what its for
6438233 i live here on less than a dollar a month

6438237 one hundred and forty tibetans are reported to have been killed but the figure needs to be confirmed
6438238 reliable witnesses say that 400 people have been killed in the region of tibetan capital lhasa alone
6438239 killed by bullets even though they were protesting without weapons their bodies were never given back to their families
6438240 we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counterproductive

6438243 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6438255 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6438256 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6438257 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted

6438259 the predictably hostile response to the album from chinese internet users as reported by an official chinese media outlet reflects continued attempts to suppress any support for tibet at a time of crisis for the tibetan people as well as the level of entrenched misinformation about tibet propagated by the beijing government among the chinese public

6438280 it is well that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system for if they did i believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning
6438281 there are some people who look with distrust upon printing press or fiat money but they overlook one of the basic facts about money it is true that we need a hard money but we should not make the mistake of associating hardness with convertibility into gold the essence of a hard money is not determined by the material of which it is composed or the material into which it is convertible the essence of a hard money is that its supply is fairly stable and there are precise limits to it in other words gold itself is a comparatively hard money because the supply of gold is inelastic bank credit convertible into gold is a very soft money because it is elastic and there are no precise limits to its supply i e it expands and contracts and a purely paper or fiat money can be hard money if we set precise limits to its supply a population standard as described above would obviously give us a much harder money than the orthodox gold credit system gave us prior to 1933 and certainly a much harder currency than the money managers are giving us today

6438347 we see fair amount of bids at 1 4180 1 4190 from those who short singapore dollar yesterday so its going to range bound between 1 4080 and 1 4120 today
6438348 i think we follow the big picture the dollar was softer overnight so dollar ringgit opened lower today
6438349 i think its more of a technical move since a couple of resistances for the dollar have already been broken

6438354 it is so nice to see improvement in the kids
6438355 for a lot of the kids theyve never been away from home so that too is a good experience the most important thing is that they learn how to get along with other and everyone helps each other out
6438356 for the first few weeks of practice we dont even put pucks on the ice
6438357 all we do is work on the skills and sometimes the kids dont even realize theyre learning because theyre having fun

6438360 we have taken this action to recover taxpayer funds spent for voting systems used in half of the states 88 counties
6438361 many of these vulnerabilities represent practical threats to the integrity of elections as they are conducted in ohio
6438362 we found vulnerabilities in different vendor systems that would for example allow voters and poll workers to place multiple votes to infect the precinct with virus software or to corrupt previously cast votes sometimes irrevocably
6438363 none of the systems out there are even remotely adequate given the importance of the data they handle
6438364 any software you put on your card would uploaded into the systems computer
6438365 there wasnt an attack that we tried that we werent able to carry out
6438366 we learned that every current e voting system has serious exploitable vulnerabilities
6438367 with the election being less than three months away the counties will be using the technology they have
6438368 the elections systems should have the same quality the same reliability the same testing and the same certification requirements as financial systems
6438369 if the systems used by banks which have to report to the sec securities and exchange commission had this level of quality no one would put their money in the bank

6438416 we are confident that our business having been restructured is in a strong position to move forward whenever the market improves
6438417 whilst at the beginning of april we experienced a significant market downturn sales volumes since then have not deteriorated any further
6438418 i think we will be in a position later this year to start talking about where some of the box plant rationalizations might take place
6438419 i would expect youd hear something from us soon it may not be in the third quarter but probably by year end we will be talking about this
6438420 global demand for all types of energy has risen steeply and supplies of finite resources like oil and gas are under intense pressure
6438421 the country now relies on energy imports and the prices we all pay for electricity and gas are ultimately determined by the law of supply and demand in a global economy
6438422 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone
6438423 this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can

6438431 his master replied well done good and faithful servant you have been faithful with a few things i will put you in charge of many things come and share your masters happiness
6438432 then the man who had received the one talent came master he said i knew that you are a hard man harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed
6438433 his master replied you wicked lazy servant so you knew that i harvest where i have not sown and gather where i have not scattered seed

6438444 russian forces last week defeated georgian forces on the territory of georgia their answers suggested a more variegated response than many in
6438445 yes russia is successfully fulfill the international obligations it took upon itself
6438446 stands behind the back of saakashvili and who directed this barbaric act of aggression
6438447 did not have any other way out but to get involved in the conflict but that which follows from this raises a multitude of questions
6438448 ashamed for russias representative at the united nations when the latter
6438449 never seen an occasion to be proud of her country with the exception of the events of august 1991 and october 1993
6438450 what is happening now is a shame and a disgrace
6438451 would have been more proud of the priorities had been more directed to the side of humanitarian assistance and the evacuation of citizens
6438452 it was necessary to stop and above all help people

6438454 i think we have a clear case of going forward with a price increase
6438455 absolutely in newsprint in europe definitely we are speaking of a substantial price increase
6438456 i dont think we see much of cost inflation going forward at the moment but we must of course compensate for what has happened
6438457 it isnt fair my friend but it just makes it easier for me to whup him
6438458 im looking toward the future now a future that looks very bright once we send twig legs back to the back bench

6438462 despite an intensifying squeeze on household budgets the uk consumer is down but by no means out
6438463 in the future we will put more resources into the training and mentoring of the afghan army
6438464 there are now 60 000 in the afghan army i believe the figures will go up from 60 000 to 80 000 and then 120 000
6438465 i believe that in time the figure for the afghan army given the size of this country may need to be even higher than 120 000
6438466 we emphasised the importance of better co operation between the two countries particularly in dealing with the insurgents that are coming across the border from pakistan to afghanistan
6438467 pakistan and the problem of terrorism there and coming from there is something that has to be raised with the pakistani government and i will continue to do so
6438468 sort out the government so that we have a full attack on corruption so that we deal with the problem of narcotics
6438469 we want to see on the ground the delivery of the results

6438477 microsoft corp weary of being cast as a stodgy oldster by apple inc s advertising is turning for help to jerry seinfeld
6438478 the software giants new 300 million advertising campaign devised by a newly hired ad agency has been closely guarded but mr seinfeld will be one of the key celebrity pitchmen say people close to the situation he will appear with microsoft chairman bill gates in ads and receive about 10 million for the work they say
6438479 the new ad effort is expected to use some variation of the slogan windows not walls according to several people familiar with the matter those people say the point is to stress breaking down barriers that prevent people and ideas from connecting the campaign said to debut sept 4 is one of the largest in the companys history
6438480 the attempted image overhaul comes as microsoft executives privately acknowledge that windows the companys most important brand has grown stale and has been battered by apples mac vs pc ads
6438481 microsofts immediate goal is to reverse the negative public perception of windows vista the latest version of the companys personal computer operating system
6438482 while apples digs at microsoft through its advertising campaign have been vexing apple is on a hot streak with its products that microsoft hasnt been able to match during the second quarter apple said it sold 41 more macs than it did during the same period the prior year that compares with growth of 15 3 in total pc shipments world wide according to idc apples desktop and notebook computers have won converts among onetime windows loyalists
6438483 after the flop of the bee movie jerry must be getting desperate
6438484 the point is to stress breaking down barriers that prevent people and ideas from connecting
6438485 have you also learned that secret from the river that there is no such thing as time
6438486 is this what you mean that the river is everywhere at the same time at the source and at the mouth at the waterfall at the ferry at the current in the ocean and in the mountains everywhere and that the present only exists for it not the shadow of the past nor the shadow of the future
6438487 and when i learned that i reviewed my life and it was also a river and siddhartha the boy siddhartha the mature man and siddhartha the old man were only separated by shadows not through reality siddharthas previous lives were also not in the past and his death and his return to brahma are not in the future nothing was nothing will be everything has reality and presence
6438488 grasping at things can only yield one of two results either the thing you are grasping at disappears or you yourself disappear it is only a matter of which occurs first

6438492 i can see 21 t 72 tanks moving towards the roki tunnel in the direction of russia
6438493 i can also see four grad artillery launchers several armoured personnel carriers and heavy trucks ready to move into the tunnel
6438494 certainly here on the road we have seen lots of russian military personnel
6438495 what we have just seen is atrocious there are russian interior ministry special forces bringing old people from villages basically emptying the villages on the south ossetian side and dumping them in gori
6438496 the pullback has started at such a pace that by the end of august 22 all the forces of the russian federation will be behind the line of our zone of responsibility
6438497 they dont show any sign that they want to give up control
6438498 it looks like the word withdrawal is understood in different ways by different people
6438499 these principles allow the russian peacekeepers to take additional measures to ensure security in the security zone
6438500 after the famous nato meeting when the alliance froze contacts with russia some leading alliance officials were whispering into my ears you are not going to halt the afghanistan transit are you
6438501 i think that assistance is probably going to happen its a matter of how much and how fast
6438502 when ukraine prioritizes its national interests it goes against russias interests and of course there will be conflict
6438503 and russia has broken through a psychological barrier to start this kind of war on former soviet territory georgia had created itself in the shape of an enemy of russia and many in russia already see us in the same way we probably rank third in the list of russias leading enemies
6438504 in that situation then russia will start playing games start provoking ukraine especially with crimea
6438505 when we think about our position on georgia i have no doubts the loss of sovereignty putting into doubt the territorial integrity of georgia this means revising the sovereignty of all
6438506 there is a reason to be wary in the short term future there is a threat in that ukraine is similar to georgia in terms of what has happened in recent years
6438507 but i find it difficult to think that the threat posed is a military one russia relies on the fact that it has more of an influence over ukraine economically
6438508 if ukraine sorts out its domestic situation and consolidates its foreign policy in terms of european and atlantic integration and this goes at a good pace then we can avoid the south ossetian scenario

6438528 there are two schools of thought he might be a wee bit fatigued with the travel for saturday but equally another game under his belt brings him closer to starting games for us
6438529 thats what we want because hes 19 years of age he gets forward he scores goals he runs well with the ball he can pass the ball and you can see that enthusiasm that hes got for the game
6438530 were very disappointed but im sure everyone will understand that its in the safety interests of spectators and those involved with the rally
6438531 people can still get close to the cars at the ramp in penrith on sunday
6438532 i dont like talking about the championship but i have to admit that i am right back in the frame

6438536 the defence attache at the russian embassy announced to us that russia has halted cooperation in the military field with nato member states
6438537 it all depends on nato priorities if they prefer to support the bankrupt saakashvili regime to partnership with russia that will not be our fault
6438538 i can only say that russia needs cooperation with nato no more than nato needs russia

6438597 the ashley homestore business model is much more efficient than the finger model and the supply chain is much more reliable
6438598 significantly less simply because youre dealing with one vendor and ashley pretty much delivers everything in two to three weeks
6438599 the big box format fingers has relied on for so long is not working well for our customers today
6438600 i made the decision because it was the best business decision i could make to ensure our company remains healthy well into the future
6438601 at the end of the day that is the best outcome for our company our employees and the finger family
6438602 all of us who spent any time in the home furnishings industry grew up with a great deal of respect for finger furniture their advertising was extremely creative they were very very strong on price promotions
6438603 i think ashley represents a new opportunity for them it certainly gives them the opportunity to cut down on overhead and still run a strong viable furniture business
6438604 very forthright in dealing with us over the course of the last six months
6438605 dealt with us fairly and kept us current with information and financially

6438610 we were able to bring together some of the negotiators and perpetrators from the apartheid years in south africa to discuss the difficult yet peaceful transition from apartheid to democracy
6438611 after four days of breaking bread and seeing how people from divided societies could be civil and discuss many issues together it made a dramatic impression
6438612 so that people would relax and get to know each other
6438613 the three of us formed a committee to make the idea a reality
6438614 as you can imagine there were many hurdles we had to overcome including finding a country where the group could safely meet the support of finlands crisis management initiative was critical in helping us to manage these difficult logistics

6438652 in addition to strengthening our organic operations this acquisition adds significantly to our optimism about the future success of emrise
6438653 we believe the addition of acc will substantially strengthen our future operating results and overall financial condition in the 12 months following closing we expect acc to add 17 million to 18 million in revenues increase overall gross margins and make a major contribution to consolidated net income and earnings per share we expect accs profit contribution to begin with a small positive impact during the third quarter of 2008 and more material net income contributions beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and going forward
6438654 we believe this will ensure that we and charles brand the former majority owner and ongoing president of acc are strategically aligned to achieve maximum benefits for emrise and its shareholders additionally with the federal net operating loss carry forwards that emrise has available we expect to shelter a large portion of accs earnings from federal taxation for the foreseeable future as a result we expect the acquisition will help generate stronger overall cash flow and be highly accretive to earnings

6438665 this agreement provides for a significant strategic addition for denbury the largest potential tertiary flood we have acquired to date this will significantly expand our area of operations and growth opportunities in the texas gulf coast region and allow us to more completely utilize the green pipeline that is in progress while the exact timing of the conroe unit flood is difficult to forecast at this point it is our goal to begin flooding this field within the next five years we are continuing to pursue additional sources of co2 particularly anthropogenic sources in the gulf coast area which if all are developed would potentially provide us with over 2 5 bcf d of co2 while we know that it is highly unlikely that all the proposed plants will be built we believe that it is reasonable to assume that those that are built will allow us to match or exceed our anticipated volumes from our natural co2 source at jackson dome as we desire to keep our balance sheet strong we plan to investigate the possible sale of our barnett shale properties to pay for the conroe unit acquisition potentially in a tax free like kind exchange however if we are not able to obtain a reasonable price for our barnett properties we would still have sufficient credit to finance this acquisition with bank or other debt this purchase is very significant for us and the effective exchange of the barnett properties for a large tertiary flood candidate is exactly the transaction we have been looking for this will make us even more focused on our tertiary operations which continue to provide denbury with growth opportunities for years into the future

6438674 the bucs were ready and we werent they were ready to play they treated it like a game and we went out there treating it like a scrimmage
6438675 as far as im concerned not from the scoreboard but just from the play within the games were behind
6438676 and we need to pick it up as far as the details and the little things flying to the ball missed tackles just knowing your assignments its really just fundamental things that are breaking down thats affecting the big things out there and thats all weve got to do is tighten down on the fundamentals

6438681 rethinking retirement four american generations share their views on lifes third act
6438682 the rethinking retirement study was a unique opportunity to hear whats on the minds of four different generations as it relates to retirement
6438683 we heard some interesting things that opened our eyes to how americans are truly thinking about spending their later years their third act if you will the launch of the online survey was partly an effort to continue our research but mostly a first step toward educating the public and encouraging them to make more informed decisions regarding their financial futures
6438684 this finding can be a tremendous learning opportunity for the other generations
6438685 the fact that members of the silent generation some already deep into their retirements were the most concerned about outliving their funds may lead younger generations to pay closer attention to their savings and investing gearing up for retirement its a cautionary sign that we hope will encourage other generations to anticipate needing more money in retirement than they may have previously believed or at least to rethink their financial requirements for retirement

6438707 this study demonstrates the potential for personalized medicine combining selection of patients with a specific type of genetic mutation and a drug treatment that has been specifically designed to overcome that mutation
6438708 the publication of these ground breaking results in the lancet offers new hope to those patients with cf due to a nonsense mutation in the cftr gene and establishes a path forward for evaluating the efficacy and long term safety of ptc124
6438709 we are very pleased by this positive outcome from our ongoing collaboration with ptc
6438710 the development of ptc124 fits well with our strategic goal of supporting approaches that have the potential to modify the course of cf we are continuing to work together with ptc and the broader cf medical community to support the next steps in the evaluation of ptc124 for the clinical benefit for the treatment of nonsense mutation cf
6438711 the polyketal microparticles we developed are simply a vehicle to get the drugs inside the body to the diseased area as quickly as possible
6438712 the major advantage to using these polyketals to deliver drugs is that they degrade into biocompatible compounds that dont accumulate in a patients tissue or cause additional inflammation
6438713 we think these microparticles are going to be fantastic for oral drug delivery because they can survive the stomach conditions before they release their contents in the intestines
6438714 patients with acute liver failure need drugs as soon as possible or else theyll die
6438715 weve tailored the polyketals hydrolysis rates to deliver the drug in one or two days
6438716 delivering proteins inside microparticles has been limited because getting the protein into the microparticles required organic solvents that frequently destroyed the proteins
6438717 to overcome this problem we developed a method of simply immobilizing the protein on the surface of the microparticles
6438718 in the past few years we have developed methods to tailor the polyketals properties which have already allowed us to target many different medical conditions but our end goal is to test these treatments in humans
6438719 we saw that sporting events can be fertile ground for illegal alcohol sales and that the seats provide an especially high risk environment at events that every year attract an average of 130 million people
6438720 we know already that theres a link between alcohol use and problem behaviors among fans
6438721 but theres more that sports stadiums can do to prevent sales to people who are clearly drunk if people are intoxicated we dont need them to consume more alcohol
6438722 combining thousands of fans with significant alcohol sales could be construed as a recipe for some serious problems like increased instances of violence and drunk driving

6438725 i think we now have very convincing evidence that prdm16 can turn cells into brown fat cells with the possibility of combating obesity
6438726 take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
6438727 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
6438728 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environmentally friendly pest control strategies it also has important implications for manipulating food flavor
6438729 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavor of the resulting oils
6438730 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
6438731 a notable strength of this manuscript is the combined use of structural and evolutionary biology to draw new insights regarding enzyme function these insights led to the striking demonstration that a single amino acid substitution converts one enzyme into another thereby showing how a single point mutation can contribute to the evolution of different biosynthetic pathways this begins to answer the long standing question as to how the same starting molecule can be converted into different products by enzymes that look strikingly similar
6438732 we have discovered that they are also present in marine animals such as sea anemone and corals however we do not know what they do in these organisms
6438733 the more carbs and sugars you eat the more your appetite control cells are damaged and potentially you consume more
6438734 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
6438735 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
6438736 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
6438737 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that its leading to premature cell deterioration
6438738 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6438739 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6438740 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother
6438741 these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6438742 in contrast to piezoelectric actuators that typically deflect or move a fraction of a micrometer comb drives can deflect tens to hundreds of micrometers and unlike conventional comb drives which only move in one direction our new device can move in two directions left to right forward and backward an advance that could really open up the door for many applications
6438743 twenty nanometers is about the size of 200 atoms so if you are scanning for a particular molecule it may be hard to find
6438744 with our design the higher atomic scale resolution should make it easier to find
6438745 this is a proof of concept the technology im developing should allow researchers to practically and efficiently extract dozens of geometric and material properties of their microdevices just by electronically probing changes in capacitance or voltage
6438746 sugar is fast and allows me to easily try out many design ideas
6438747 after i narrow down to a particular design i then use finite element analysis for fine tuning finite element analysis is slow but it is able to model subtle physical phenomena that sugar doesnt do as well
6438748 obesity is occurring at epidemic rates in the u s and worldwide and that impacts the risk and prognosis of many diseases
6438749 we hope this study can be translated into applications to help treat or prevent obesity
6438750 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain in the body
6438751 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population
6438752 however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
6438753 to whom the fat rolls im tired of books where a self loathing heroine is teased to the point where she starves herself skinny in hopes of a fabulous new life

6438795 large search marketing programs have become increasingly complex with typical programs encompassing hundreds of thousands of keywords across hundreds of concurrent campaigns but many companies and agencies are still struggling to manage these programs with linked spreadsheets low functionality ad center applications or a patchwork of point solutions we refer to these as black box solutions because they provide marketers and agencies with very little visibility or control over their programs

6438837 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

6438854 the u s mint has suspended sales of american eagle gold coins
6438855 the suspension is overwhelming evidence that the futures contract price of gold on the commodities exchanges is substantially below the physical market price and that indeed the commodities exchanges are being used as gata long has maintained as part of a massive scheme of manipulation of the precious metals currency and bond markets
6438856 the western central banks desperate to prop up a corrupt and tottering financial system have put gold so much on sale that even the u s mint cant find any now
6438857 regardless of why silver went down by so much so fast why did it go down at all
6438858 many people agree there is a shortage of retail investor silver but they get confused by the lower price they think a lower price means more silver must have come into the market
6438859 well if one looks at the classical supply demand dynamic where the supply curve meeting the demand curve determines the price then yes silver supply must have come onto the market to swamp demand making the price go down thats the way things work everybody knows that do i look like i am stupid or something
6438860 wrong o thats how all markets work price equilibrates demand and supply so that they equal each other
6438861 our markets are affected by paper silver futures contracts and very few people ever attempt to take delivery of that silver they buy it on leverage for the investment returns not for real silver so some people can sell silver promises to excess and never deliver and if they sell more paper silver than exists that can manipulate the price

6438921 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6438922 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6438926 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

6438933 what takes care of neutralizing dna to allow chromosomes to condense
6438934 did dinoflagellates once have histones and then lost them or did dinoflagellates never have histones and just figured out a different way to fold large amounts of dna into chromosomes
6438935 chromosomes would fall apart when calcium and magnesium were removed
6438936 cations play a very important role in the folding and charge neutralization of dna in all eukaryotes but more so in dinoflagellates
6438937 i find it truly amazing that in all other eukaryotes histones help in this charge neutralization and dinoflagellates constitute the only exception to this nearly universal rule it looks like this may have been the first and very efficient step toward the goal of neutralizing dna long before histones came into play
6438938 dont get me started on the mozzarella stick she said
6438939 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
6438940 we urge beneficiaries to choose wisely when selecting their drug coverage
6438941 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress
6438942 about 70 of operating costs are now fuel or labor related which does not leave much room for further cost reductions especially since all the obvious things have been done
6438943 slow growth the rest of the year and possibly an economy grinding to a halt
6438944 if theres a second half recovery itll be the second half of 2009
6438945 the recent decline in gas prices isnt enough to overcome all the negative momentum thats been building up
6438946 suggests the risks for further economic weakening in the near term remain elevated
6438947 the equity markets continue to trade in an environment of weak growth and high inflationary pressure with negative ramifications for corporate profits
6438948 these markets are very very thin they arent moving in a particularly rational manner
6438949 the problem we have is that fannie mae and freddie mac are obviously on their last legs and the question is whether the u s government is going to intervene or not
6438950 its impacting negatively on financial sentiment and i think thats probably likely to continue until we get a resolution
6438951 without sustained stabilization of the bank indexes there will be no recovery in the equity market beyond a bear market rally
6438952 since winning the bbc show id do anything jodie has been working hard to build upon the training she underwent during the programme
6438953 i am so sad that this together with other allegations made have been raised to distract and unsettle me the coaching team and more importantly my boxers ahead of the most important bouts of their lives
6438954 over the past four years i have put together a programme which has produced the best ever commonwealth games results three world championship medallists the most qualifiers for the olympic games since 1972 but more importantly i have tried to instil in my team a respect for themselves and others and a sense of pride in competing for their country i will thoroughly address all allegations made when i get back to the uk right now i have three boxers who are fighting to win gold medals for team gb and i will not allow anything to distract them from what they need to do in the ring
6438955 the aba choosing yesterday to issue billy joe saunders with a suspension relating to an incident which happened months before the beijing olympic games is extremely disappointing
6438956 we are frustrated that our athletes and the boxing coaching team will have to deal with this added pressure and distraction at this point in the games nobody involved with boxing should be distracting the team at this time
6438957 which is not only necessary but essential for his defence
6438958 has held that the uk government is under a duty to disclose evidence which it holds about the treatment of binyam mohamed between his detention by pakistani authorities in april 2002 and his subsequent reappearance in bagram air base in july 2004
6438959 we are considering the implications of this judgment very carefully
6438960 we have never contested that mr mohameds defence lawyers should have access to information which would assist him in his defence in any trial at guantanamo bay
6438961 the court recognised the strenuous efforts that we have made to assist mr mohamed in guantanamo bay including efforts to ensure that the information hmg holds which relates to a small part of mr mohameds account of what happened to him is made available to him for purposes of his defence in any prosecution in the us system
6438962 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily
6438963 these and other issues relating to national security will be considered at a further hearing next week
6438964 todays judgment reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the united states government in the supposed war on terror
6438965 it has taken the courts of this country to intervene and reiterate the importance of upholding the rule of law
6438966 we can only hope that the foreign secretary will now reflect on this judgment and provide direct assistance to binyams defence team
6438967 compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered
6438968 the next step is for the british government to demand an end to the charade against him in guantanamo bay and return him home to britain
6438969 we commend the courts recognition that torture is abhorrent and can never be justified
6438970 that evidence plainly discloses a case to answer but bm contends that this evidence is inadmissible because it was obtained as a result of a two year period of incommunicado detention between april 2002 and may 2004 during which he was subjected to torture and cruel inhuman or degrading treatment at the hands of the pakistani and moroccan authorities with the connivance of the united states government and to similar treatment by the united states government itself
6438971 because he contends he is under no duty to do so and because of his concerns of resulting damage to national security
6438972 will make no order for the provision of the information
6438973 and the court has made its decision on those issues at a further hearing and if the court decides that information is to be provided has resolved any dispute as to the manner in which it is to be provided
6438974 was in fact any wrongdoing by or on behalf of the united states government
6438975 it is important to emphasise that we therefore do not do so
6438976 it is clear from the evidence we have seen that every effort has been made by the united kingdom government to try and secure bms return and to provide him with assistance save for disclosing to his lawyers the documents and information the subject of these proceedings
6438977 the refusal to disclose is based on concerns of damage to national security that such disclosure might well entail
6438978 has a very strong record in advocating the case against torture and urging other states not to use torture
6438979 this is a welcome ruling any information that the uk government holds about how binyam mohamed may have been treated must be made available to his legal team
6438980 if torture or ill treatment has taken place it should be exposed investigated and any confessions extracted under torture should be discounted
6438981 binyam has already been held in harsh conditions for over six years according to his lawyer his mental health has suffered considerably
6438982 david miliband should ask the us to move him to a less oppressive part of the guantanamo prison complex at the earliest opportunity
6438983 we dont know how to explain this so when we dont know how to explain things in the medical world we call it a miracle and this is probably what happened
6438984 there have been a number of well documented case histories of adults and children who drowned in very cold water even trapped under ice for hours and were successfully revived many hours later
6438985 of course this is used routinely in modern cardiac bypass
6438986 there is some historical precedent for how this might work
6438987 many years ago some babies were put into ice water at birth to try to revive them there were reports that this actually could be effective and that some children survived
6438988 i am convinced that cold therapy helped this young man
6438989 although i read the report i still find it hard to believe
6438990 usually cool temperatures increase the likelihood of death in extremely preterm infants
6438991 probably the doctors could not feel a pulse heard few or no heartbeats and saw that the baby was not moving now it can be very difficult to be sure about death in such immature babies right after birth i have seen cases in my own institution of mistaken diagnosis

6439000 say that they spend more than two thirds of a full time job being legislators although their income from legislative work is greater than that in some other states its usually not enough to allow them to make a living without having other sources of income
6439001 devised and intended to devise a scheme and artifice to defraud and obtain money and property belonging to others by means of false and fraudulent pretenses representations and promises
6439002 it was further part of the scheme and artifice that defendant schmitz sought to facilitate her fraudulent activity by seeking and obtaining authorization to perform services for the city program on a flexible work schedule
6439003 the prosecutor told jurors the case will boil down to a few questions
6439004 ms schmitz has also been a longtime employee of c i t y cacc the decision to hire her was made by the president of central alabama community college he set her work hours work schedule and what she would be doing in her job the president of the college also participated in firing ms schmitz ms schmitz was not free to pick who she worked with or who worked under her her direct supervisor was an employee of central alabama community college
6439005 prohibit the defendant from referencing this lawsuit at any fashion at trial including its filings as well as any rulings or determinations issued
6439006 the admission of such evidence will only serve to confuse distract and mislead the jury
6439007 prohibit the defendant from suggesting to the jury that schmitz could fulfill her obligations to the city program by advocating on its behalf or providing any advice or assistance on matters concerning the legislature
6439008 develop and maintain a positive working relationship with members of the state of alabama legislative delegation various city and county officials relative to city locations
6439009 establish a positive working relationship with various state service providers i e department of human resources department of mental health and department of youth services
6439010 prosecutors outlined the case theyll present against schmitz in a 41 page trial memorandum after it was reviewed by

6439049 the goal was to make music which sounded good on the dance floor or stuff that would make people want to move as opposed to something that you want to sit down and immerse yourself in

6439064 which popular tv personality is decidedly less popular with his production crew not only is he incredibly rude he also makes work experience lackeys do all his research for him
6439065 i always thought that one day these two female b list actresses 1 tv and film equally 2 primarily tv with almost identical careers who are best friends would get married well they still might actually but for now they are on the outs if i could cackle right now i would the two have been known to vacation with each other however when it came time to go this year 1 thought she was going to have other plans so 2 made plans with some other celebrities because thats what celebrities do they vacation together well when 1s plans fell through she naturally thought she could tag along not so fast turns out 2 et al didnt want 1 around and 2 didnt hold back in telling her why as in 30 minutes of telling off should have done that a really long time ago
6439066 it always makes me laugh when people say is she isnt she its like eventually you will know so just chill out for a minute

6439069 i havent even heard about it i dont ever pay attention to that stuff shes one of my best friends in the whole world and honestly when youre sitting in a room for three hours doing satellite interviews we were staring at a post it with a smiley face so i think i probably rolled my eyes a hundred times

6439071 mr president are you aware our flesh and blood is dying over there when the coffins come back do you care when only the poor kids die is it fair dont get me wrong i respect the flag but it hurts to see a kid in a body bag he fought for his country with all he had now we have a family without a dad
6439072 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great i want to tell all young girls to walk around in bikinis all summer and enjoy it i want to tell them to never ever feel bad about anything because there will be that one day in your 20s when youll eat a hamburger and actually see the hamburger on the side of your leg
6439073 i love horses ive learned from them once you master a horse but it also masters you you gain more confidence in yourself riding horses has a rhythm thats rather zen like when you can mount it and move it and move along with it that is a hard won and very real accomplishment
6439074 i wont say im never going to do drugs again i just know im not a good person on drugs
6439075 the majority of times i go to the cinema i want a bit of everything i want to be challenged intellectually and then again i dont want to be too challenged intellectually i believe my wife to be very creative so of course im interested in how she thinks and there seems to be no end to the desire to be creative i find that invigorating and interesting you know you have conversations some deep some shallow thats the same in everybodys relationship
6439076 i dont think running for office is anything im prepared for or could even prepare myself for i work really long hours and work a lot and have done press tours and junkets but there is nothing like a presidential campaign that i have experienced before i think at one point we visited three different cities in one state in 12 hours its exhausting

6439080 however i don t see much progress in the matter of professional journalism ethics of journalism and freedom of the press these three aspects need to be addressed quickly as the advancement on them is slow
6439081 i do not envision ebb in this tide of progress in the future especially as the population grows i can only see the media in the uae growing in presence readership and diversity of coverage

6439095 declare que skanska pag arbitrios de construcci n en exceso por la cantidad de 313 691 83 y ordene
6439096 el texto es claro de sus respectivas ordenanzas que imponen el arbitrio de construcci n nica y exclusivamente sobre aquello que constituyas actividad de construcci n tomando como la base tributable el costo en que se incurra para realizar el proyecto luego de deducirle los costos de estudios y permisos por no constituir actividad de construcci n

6439099 cancel every federal state or local regulation or restriction on abortion the national organization for women says it would abolish all restrictions on government funding of abortion
6439100 how is it essential for the life or health of a woman that her baby who somehow survived the horrible ordeal of abortion be left to die or put to death yet that is what obama voted for thrice in the illinois senate
6439101 obama says he opposed the born alive infants protection act because he feared it might imperil roe v wade
6439102 but if roe v wade did allow infanticide or murder which is what letting a tiny baby die of neglect or killing it outright amounts to why would he not want that court decision reviewed and amended to outlaw infanticide
6439103 i could find no instance in his entire career in which he voted for any regulation or restriction on the practice of abortion
6439104 are smearing him on the internet for supposedly being a secret muslim or supposedly not saluting the flag
6439105 a look at sen obamas political and adult life just to try and see if he is the man that his multi million dollar media campaign portrays him as
6439106 reformer and the flexible reasonable man that the mainstream media has accepted him as
6439107 i think even a cursory examination of his career puts the lie to both these ideas
6439108 his attempt to appear ideologically flexible and moderate is deceptive and untrue and his judgment is very poor
6439109 people tell pro lifers a lot that when you bring this issue up youre being divisive and yet here he is promising to open that can of worms as his first act of office
6439110 at amp t has long been a familiar face in the homes of americans first installing phone service high speed internet service and now at amp t u verse tv

6439114 everyware the dawning age of ubiquitous computing from the rfid tags now embedded in everything from soda cans to the family pet to smart buildings that subtly adapt to the changing flow of visitors to gestural interfaces like the ones seen in minority report computing no longer looks much like it used to
6439115 they kjo advocates talk more about the king james version than they do about christ
6439116 and look tell me you aint did it you aint did it and if you did then thats family business
6439117 at the end of history there are no serious ideological competitors left to
6439118 for the first time in many years a real competitive environment has emerged on the market of ideas
6439119 the west is losing its monopoly on the globalization process
6439120 the final curtain would fall and the would no longer be played
6439121 the world problem cannot be solved if america does not accept its full share of responsibility in solving it
6439122 oh you know like an old lady a little pain here a little pain there
6439123 soon after that the younger son took all that had been given to him and went to another country far away there he spent all he had on wild and foolish living
6439124 i am not good enough to be called your son but may i be as the one of the workmen you pay to work
6439125 the older son said to his father all these many years i have served you i have always obeyed what you said but you never gave me a young goat so i could have a supper and a good time with my friends but as soon as this son of yours came back you killed the fat calf and yet he wasted your money with bad women
6439126 oh and it seems dale has wrested the ball away from bob thats some fancy footwork there but i wonder if hell be charged a foul for wings
6439127 boy ahh say boyy nice kid but about as sharp as a soccer ball
6439128 either you date a rich girl from the north shore or a cool girl from the south shore
6439129 to everything there is a season a time for every purpose under heaven and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck what is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh time to mourn and a time to dance a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to gain and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to throw away a time to tear and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace
6439130 yeah no coffee soda nicotine chocolate tomatoes onions fatty foods or spice
6439131 you will get better or you will die thats the way it is
6439132 youve been in korea so long youve forgotten how funny you are
6439133 stop it dont do it anymore my son stop it you cannot do it anymore stop using your own strength you will be very tired
6439134 where do you find the love to offer he who betrays you and offer to wash my feet as i offer to disobey you your beauty does bereave me and how my words do fail so faithfully and dutifully i award you with betrayal
6439135 where do you find the love to offer he who betrays you and offer to wash my feet as i offer to disobey you
6439136 jesus my heart is all i have to give to you so weak and so unworthy this simply will not do no alabaster jar no diamond in the rough for your body that was broken how can this be enough by me you were abandoned by me you were betrayed yet in your arms and in your heart forever i have stayed your glory illuminates my life and no darkness will descend for you have loved me forever and your love will never end
6439137 because two thirds of u s oil is still in place we can use these organisms to convert residual hydrocarbons into natural gas and create a new source of domestic energy the concept of anaerobic metabolism is an innovative process and the ou initiative is the only one of its kind in the united states at the present time we are also experimenting with shales and other unconventional reservoirs
6439138 are you sure the kids will think this is cool
6439139 ich habe gemerkt dass radio ein spannendes medium ist und freue mich sehr auf meine neue sendung bei quu fm
6439140 ein websender kann von berall senden f r unserer h rer klingt das modern und f r b rbel ist es komfortabel weil sie nicht reisen muss
6439141 der humor und wortwitz von b rbel sch fer ist klasse das wird ein gro er spa f r unsere h rer
6439142 ich werde ganz spontan und ohne lange proben wie bei gro en shows meine radiosendung moderieren das finde ich sehr aufregend

6439144 it is interesting to watch an analogy of the financial markets in action in an attempt to achieve transparency based on artistic process
6439145 i know exactly who should play dave liezewski because he just got the job last week
6439146 its really hard to get charismatic actors at that age but we lucked out we got one and hes absolutely brilliant
6439147 hes unknown in america hes going to be a star after this
6439148 if you see me doing a sequel to this comic im doing it for the cash
6439149 the movie introduced a lot of elements that we didnt have so theres plenty of room for them to go off and do something theyve asked me to be involved with that
6439150 we dont do options if you option it you have no real control over it
6439151 the deal that were doing is that we get the actor the prodcuers that we want and we just make the film or its off the table
6439152 this week were going to decide which studio were going to run with there are four or five at the moment that want to do it
6439153 i think its really important to get this out somewhere between 2010 and 2011 because one of two things will happen either the world will possibly end at that point the other thing is the situation can change i dont want it lying around like watchmen for 20 years
6439154 every crisis is a judgement a call to see where things have gone wrong and to seek to set matters right both within our consciousness and in society the environmental crisis the economic crisis the crisis of justice the crisis of faith the employment crises the crisis of militarism all these are symptoms not only that humanity has to yet become what is has to be but also that we are on the wrong track
6439155 its really great because as a kid i was a huge superman fan and i watched all the movies with my parents
6439156 im a big pop culture mythology guy so stories like the superman mythology and the star wars mythology theyre significant and theyre important because i think theyre great tools for teaching basic moralities especially to kids so thats why i am so into them thats why i feel very lucky to be a part of it
6439157 you know who doesnt want to take a swing at that guy
6439158 i just hope the fans like what we do with it because its our own interpretation its with the blessing of dc comics and we are not invalidating any back story doomsdays had previously but we are interpreting and adding to that back story and hopefully the fans dig on it
6439159 i was told that early on i think battlestar galactica co star katee sackhoff suggested that to me because she went though hell with that stuff about playing starbuck i try to stay away from it and just kind of do what i think i should do and hope they like it and eventually it will trickle back whether people like it or not id rather have that happen in sort of a more natural process then going to seek it out
6439160 i dont stay up late at night googling myself too often
6439161 i will say that i do like to hear fans reactions because i dont take things very personally and i know that a lot of the time i am just more impressed and excited that people care so much even if its negative
6439162 i really want to know who clark is and whats going on with him
6439163 i am very inquisitive about clark because he was close to lex and lex is missing thats pretty much the only thing i want to find out right now is where he is and i think that clark can help me do that so im trying to find out ways that i can convince clark to help me out
6439164 the stories about him are incredible everybody loves him and watching him hes so talented id absolutely love to work with michael rosenbaum
6439165 what i can tell you is that we know each other
6439166 and im still finding out how we know each other but we do
6439167 the pilot i shot with justin was so much fun
6439168 we got to play paramedics so there was a lot of needles involved and there was a lot of tubing it was really cool then to have the opportunity to work with him again because its a familiar face coming into a group of people you dont know its nice to have one person that you do know
6439169 whats cool is that there are members of the crew that were on battlestar galactica
6439170 so getting there were some friendly faces that was really awesome
6439171 and i cant say anything about that but its a very cool thing where that relationship is going its a new type of thing for the show ill say this i dont think clark has had the opportunity to have a friend like davis and likewise i cant get any more vague then that can i theyre going to have a very unique buddy buddy friendship and that sounds weird too doesnt it i just cant talk about it i really cant its an awesome idea though its a really awesome idea
6439172 he grew up in the foster system he was bounced from home to home and had a very tough childhood he is brought into the story as he forms this fast friendship with chloe and eventually he starts sort of blacking out missing time and he becomes curious as to why that is happening what he learns is really horrible stuff he finds out that he is innately the opposite of what he wanted to be hopefully the telling of that story will be very sad and psychologically messed up and it will probably very easily be the darkest stuff smallville has ever done
6439173 then eventually he is doomsday and he will eventually resemble the character dc comics fans are expecting
6439174 playing those roles its really tiring but its a great challenge
6439175 i like doing things that intimidate me you know when i read the script for the mist
6439176 whatever is good and perfect comes to us from god above
6439177 im not one of those hippies that doesnt fix their pets
6439178 corinne once we get onto the 405 i want you to get the xanax out of my purse and split one with me then light us a cigarette
6439179 this is only the beginning we will continue to work hard on expanding our offerings of searchable literature databases and our services for scholars worldwide

6439184 every time i have had a piece done at gaudeamus new music week in the netherlands
6439185 i always have a group of angry young italian composers following me around asking why
6439186 t he early minimalist works of philip glass and steve reich had a massive influence on me but i realized as my teacher louis andriessen did much earlier that for cultural and psychological reasons it would be false for me to use repetition in the same way they do or did so i suppose i use a lot of repetition to create a state of unease ambiguity and sometimes joy and also to laugh at the world
6439187 i know i often want to push an aspect in a piece to its limits
6439188 there was a turning point when i wrote a piano quintet when i was 22 the very beginning of the piece was a repeated staccato e major chord with an added seventh hearing this small opening section gave me a weirdly ecstatic physical sensation and it was the first time i really liked what i had written so it was through this type of experience that i started writing consonant tonal material
6439189 i also think i use these types of material as they are familiar objects in a way comforting so that it makes the play with structure more audible i want the listener to be concentrating on this instead of wondering how a sound was produced by an instrument
6439190 of course how others perceive the result is totally open and i am happy if the listener comes to their own conclusion as to what the material is saying this would be my only conscious social or political motivation to make listeners think for themselves to encourage inquiry
6439191 i simply use my ears i listen to everything over and over again until it sounds in my mind right sometimes i will use localized patterns and work with some numbers to create imbalance but the final decisions are always based on instinct i am too controlling to let a system make decisions for me i have to get my hands dirty
6439192 to make an effort to hear something to pay attention
6439193 the way i see it 280 on the side of my cup
6439194 you can learn a lot more from listening than you can from talking find someone with whom you dont agree in the slightest and ask them to explain themselves at length then take a seat shut your mouth and dont argue back its physically impossible to listen with your mouth open
6439195 go near to listen rather than to offer sacrifice of fools do not be quick with your mouth do not be hasty in your heart to utter anything before god god is in heaven and you are on earth so let your words be few

6439233 nous ne souhaitons pas et navons pas besoin dexpulser les arabes et de prendre leur place
6439234 lhistorien qui r v le des v rit s g nantes et qui d truit des mythes est per u comme un ennemi du peuple
6439235 le terrorisme arabe j rusalem et ha fa y rend la vie des juifs difficile quant aux juifs de j rusalem ils sont tenus en otage et il est peu probable que les forces arm es juives soient capables de lever le blocus arabe
6439236 dans le territoire accord l tat juif il y a pr sent 520 000 juifs et peu pr s 350 000 non juifs presque tous arabes si on inclut j rusalem les juifs ne constitueront que 60 de la population de l tat juif il faut donc une nouvelle approche il faut que nous pensions comme un tat
6439237 afin dassurer lexistence et le futur de l tat juif il faudra faire venir un million et demi de juifs dans le pays
6439238 la fin des ann es 60 et dans les ann es 70 le gush emunim ne cessa de violer la loi en construisant des colonies en cisjordanie les gouvernements travaillistes de l poque dirig s par l vi eshkol golda m r et yitzhak rabin c d rent au gush emunim
6439239 la guerre est la guerre nous ne lavons pas commenc e ce sont eux qui ont fait la guerre et je ne veux pas que ceux qui se sont enfuis reviennent je ne veux pas quils refassent la guerre
6439240 je ne veux pas que ceux qui se sont enfuis reviennent
6439241 la guerre est la guerre nous ne lavons pas commenc e ce sont eux qui ont fait la guerre et je ne veux pas quils nous refassent la guerre
6439242 je lui avais clairement fait comprendre l poque que nous ne pouvions pas laider envahir la palestine mandataire puisque nous tions tenus dhonorer la r solution de lonu recommandant l tablissement de deux tats nous ne pouvions donc pas et cest ce que je lui dis soutenir la violation de cette r solution
6439243 un tat arabe en palestine occidentale est moins dangereux quun tat li la transjordanie et plus tard lirak
6439244 lhistoriographie sioniste est pleine daccusations vis vis de la grande bretagne qui aurait arm les arm es arabes et aurait tout fait pour emp cher l tablissement de l tat juif ces accusations vont lencontre de la v rit historique telle quelle est r v l e par les documents britanniques arabes et isra liens
6439245 le but de b vin tait apparemment dassurer que la l gion arabe dabdallah envahisse toute la palestine ne laissant un tat juif si minuscule quil naurait dautre choix que de se livrer la merci du gouvernement britannique
6439246 je nai aucune intention de reconna tre l tat juif et encore moins lintention de soutenir son admission aux nations unies
6439247 lid e dun tat disra l contr lant une grande partie de la palestine dont le n gu v ne peut que susciter notre inqui tude je ne veux pas sous estimer le danger dun isra l joignant le camp communiste
6439248 il est vrai que les juifs ont t victimes de pers cutions et dun massacre terrible mais ils sen sont sortis et beaucoup ont surv cu il faut les aider se r int grer en allemagne
6439249 les juifs allemands vivent dans leur pays dorigine et ne lont jamais quitt
6439250 nous faisons tout pour que le gouvernement am ricain maintienne lembargo afin demp cher que les juifs de palestine obtiennent des armes
6439251 si les arabes rejettent le cessez le feu nos efforts pour emp cher la lev e de lembargo nauront servi rien
6439252 un tat juif nest pas plus dans notre int r t que dans celui des arabes
6439253 c tait exactement la m thode dhitler il faisait entrer les gens comme touristes mais ils se procuraient des armes apr s s tre incrust s les juifs entr rent comme immigrants pour devenir des soldats
6439254 beaucoup de ressources mat rielles en particulier le p trole sont en jeu il est important que les arabes naient pas le sentiment davoir t l s s
6439255 le discours de b vin du 13 novembre 1945 nous fit comprendre sans lombre dun doute que le peuple juif plong dans le d sarroi allait maintenant tre assailli par le gouvernement britannique qui avait donn trente ans auparavant sa b n diction au foyer national juif la rh torique de b vin tait devenue vulgaire et insultante non pas que nous attendions de la grande bretagne quelle f t abstraction de ses int r ts au proche orient en particulier de son contr le des ressources p troli res la jordanie tait un protectorat britannique l gypte tait li e la grande bretagne par un trait de d fense et les forces britanniques taient encore pr sentes en irak mais ces int r ts pour l gitimes quils fussent ne justifiaient aucunement lanimosit de b vin notre gard en quoi avait il besoin de d clarer que truman veut que les juifs aillent en palestine parce quil ne les veut pas new york
6439256 je nai jamais rencontr un homme d gageant autant dhostilit non seulement travers ses propos mais galement travers ses expressions faciales et son regard il nexprima jamais notre gard le moindre respect humain sans parler de d f rence diplomatique m me son humour tait vulgaire lors dune de nos rencontres londres il y eut une coupure d lectricit qui taient fr quentes apr s la guerre et b vin sexclama tiens toutes les lumi res se sont teint sauf les isra lites b vin justifia son opposition au plan de partage en expliquant quil serait injuste de soumettre 400 000 arabes un gouvernement juif ce quoi je ne puis memp cher de r pliquer en quoi serait il plus juste de soumettre 650 000 juifs un gouvernement arabe sa seule r ponse fut un regard assassin
6439257 il ne fait aucun doute que ernest d teste les juifs

6439259 on ne peut pas faire domelette sans casser des ufs quand le choix est entre tre d truit et d truire il vaut mieux d truire il y a des circonstances dans lhistoire qui justifient la purification ethnique lorsque le choix est entre la purification ethnique et le g nocide lannihilation de votre propre peuple je pr f re la purification ethnique un tat juif naurait pas pu merger sans le d racinement de 700 000 palestiniens il tait donc n cessaire de les d raciner il n tait pas possible de laisser une cinqui me colonne dans le pays yishuv fut attaqu par les palestiniens et les tats arabes il ny avait pas de choix il fallait expulser les palestiniens noubliez pas que les arabes contr lent une grande partie de la plan te du fait de leurs conqu tes et de leurs meurtres ils ont 22 tats les juifs nen avaient pas m me un il ny avait pas de raison de leur refuser ce droit donc de mon point de vue le besoin d tablir cet tat passe avant linjustice inflig e aux palestiniens
6439260 aurait d finir le boulot je sais que cela enrage les arabes et les tenants du politiquement correct mais ben gourion aurait d organiser une expulsion en masse et vider le pays de tous ses arabes et ce jusquau jourdain
6439261 tout commenc en lan 2000 jai toujours t de gauche et jai refus de servir dans les territoires mais lorsque les palestiniens rejet rent les propositions de barak en juillet 2000 et les propositions de clinton en d cembre 2000 jai compris quils refusent la solution de deux tats ils veulent tout lod et acre et jaffa arafat nous a arnaqu s et na jamais t sinc re les palestiniens nacceptent pas lexistence dun tat juif que ce soit sur 80 ou sur 30 du pays ce sont des barbares et il faut les enfermer dans une cage il faut enfermer cette b te sauvage
6439262 ben gourion disait que les arabes ne comprennent que la force il avait raison

6439270 its hard to tell parents how to interact with their children based on one study but what we see here is that parents who have a propensity for being verbally aggressive have a tendency to try to direct and control their children during a play period
6439271 as a result these children were less co operative and not only are parents setting up situations that are challenging for them to handle but they also are subtly undermining their childs self esteem
6439272 the aggressive action is not overt as in a parent hitting or yelling but these small negative manoeuvers can say so much to a child
6439273 these parents were in an unstructured low stress environment and if we saw this behaviour in such a brief setting how could such negative interaction even so subtle affect a child over the long term
6439274 for example if the parents always have to control what activity they and their children are going to play as well as for how long and how they are going to play it you wonder if this communicates to the child that what they want to do doesnt matter

6439292 among the surprises we talked to some democrats about mccains reputation for having a big temper
6439293 both also say they think democrats who say mccain is too volatile too temperamental are just wrong and that they think if he wins the election they dont want that but these two leading democrats say if he wins the election theyd be happy to work with him they actually think hed make a pretty good president
6439294 i have no doubt over the last eight weeks given some of the media articles we have suffered brand damage

6439325 pensando en 2009 todo el mundo ve con preocupaci n el tema fiscal
6439326 es que va a ser exigente la situaci n financiera va a ser un a o electoral y continuar n los subsidios al sector privado
6439327 nadie piensa que la argentina pueda caer en el default pero s todos miramos con preocupaci n el gobierno tiene cerrados los canales internacionales pero tiene el cierre de 2008 para negociar la apertura de un mercado internacional cerrando un acuerdo con el club de paris
6439328 la situaci n fiscal iba a ser el ancla de la inflaci n pensando en el a o electoral que empieza
6439329 yo creo que el gobierno tiene m rgenes de libertad para accionar y cambiar
6439330 por eso la mayor preocupaci n es si el ejecutivo va a reaccionar pol ticamente
6439331 creo que el problema de fondo en el pa s es la inflaci n y esto excede la discusi n del indec

6439336 esto es lo peor que le puede pasar al modelo
6439337 es probable que 2009 sea un a o con m s problemas econ micos que los anteriores
6439338 hoy el principal problema es que se nos ha metido en el cuerpo el virus de la inflaci n
6439339 aunque est relacionado con todos esos cap tulos del manual del fmi a esta altura el problema de la inflaci n los excede y requiere soluciones espec ficas y delicadas que incluyen entre otros temas el manejo de las expectativas la pol tica salarial y de tipo de cambio

6439344 the department of corrections is flooding the commonwealth with people not due to be released from either jail or parole supervision
6439345 2 in the 2008 legislative session the kentucky legislature passed a budget for 2008 2010 hereafter referred to hb 406 language was slipped into the budget language for the department of corrections fundamentally changing the way that the department of corrections determines when prisoners get parole how much and in what manner parolees get jail credit when their parole is revoked and at what point parolees are determined to have served heir entire sentence
6439346 4 nowhere in hb 406 does it authorize the application of the statute in a retroactive manner
6439347 15 this action is brought pursuant to krs 418 404 the kentucky rules of civil procedure cr 57 cr 65 01 cr 65 03 and cr 65 04 to stop ongoing and continuous violations of the laws and constitution of the commonwealth of kentucky these violations being the existence of unconstitutional provisions with the body of hb 406 as well as the illegal and unconstitutional actions by the department of corrections regarding their application of certain provisions of hb 406
6439348 28 section 77 of the kentucky constitution vests all power of pardons and commutations in the office of the governor amongst other requirements the governor must make certain written findings to exercise this power
6439349 29 krs 439 340 mandates that parole shall be ordered only for the best interest of society and not as an award of clemency and it shall not be considered a reduction of sentence or pardon
6439350 30 krs 13a 130 mandates that an administrative body by internal policy memorandum or other forces of action may not expand or limit a statute of administrative regulation
6439351 31 krs 446 080 mandates that no statute shall be construed to be retroactive unless expressly so declared

6439383 no one is more committed to clean energy solutions than nancy pelosi
6439384 the upcoming debate in congress will allow the truth to come out that offshore drilling wont lower gas prices today tomorrow or a even a decade from now and will simply benefit big oils bottom line instead of helping hardworking americans
6439385 the new legislation that speaker pelosi has outlined includes crucial clean energy solutions and other important measures that will make america more energy independent offer consumers relief at the pump and will force drilling supporters to admit whether they really want to move america forward or simply want to continue helping the oil companies
6439386 over the weekend sierra club stated that speaker pelosis new compromise energy legislation will force drilling supporters to admit whether they really want to move america forward or simply want to continue helping the oil companies
6439387 despite months of complaining and political stunts boehner and his allies are now refusing to fast track comprehensive energy legislation
6439388 they held the congress hostage and blocked measure after measure while gas prices soared
6439389 boehner is complaining that renewable energy common sense policies that will bring immediate relief at the pump and taking away billions in government giveaways from big oil are poison pills boehner and other none of the above supporters will find out soon enough that opposing clean energy and being in the pocket of big oil is whats really poisonous

6439396 why have the democrats let the republicans twist this to their advantage like they always do with everything
6439397 i think we need to be moving forward with a comprehensive energy program and we betsy and i have advocated for that
6439398 the problem the reality is that its difficult to get there when you have two oilmen in the white house
6439399 what i dont think people realize is that we are already doing off shore drilling right now in the gulf coast and other places
6439400 i am against off shore drilling and drilling in anwr
6439401 i hope you realize our planet is already in distress and we need to pursue other energy alternatives
6439402 my opponent is in anwr right now because she believes that drilling there is the right way to go
6439403 and i think that is what is wrong with washington d c we need to stop putting band aid fixes on things instead of looking for real long term solutions
6439404 we have got to do something about the high price of fuel not just car fuel but home heating fuel too

6439422 we want to win our home games starting with bolton and make it a difficult place to come for opponents
6439423 we will be back tonight but well be ready for bolton after man united were aiming to win the next match we have to make it two good games in row
6439424 we had a good start at manchester united and it was important to get a point there because its a difficult place to play
6439425 man united are the champions so it was a big result
6439426 the supporters were great at old trafford and now i am looking forward to seeing the stadium full at home already i know that they always shout a lot
6439427 i am very pleased to complete this deal which gives us five senior strikers and provides the manager with a good array of attacking options at his disposal
6439428 at the end of the day you cant say sh
6439429 how fast can another human being go before there is no more running fast
6439430 gostaria de continuar a aventura com este elenco e espero assegurar a perman ncia da equipe na primeira divis o
6439431 nosso time sofreu mas jogou com vontade e venceu sob os olhares de um p blico incr vel
6439432 vencemos este jogo lutando mas precisamos melhorar se quisermos a classifica o
6439433 people come out and tell us that they appreciate us being there and they appreciate what were trying to do
6439434 and the ones who dont appreciate what were trying to do are usually the guys we are detaining at 2 in the morning
6439435 any murderer is going to have clout with a potential victim but the extremists are losing that with the people to a certain extent
6439436 they have changed their operations from night time to day time to avoid us they dont own the night we do
6439437 they dont want them chasing their daughters influencing their sons
6439438 the people are getting tired of that stuff and i dont think their influence is that big here any more
6439439 he wasnt trying to give us a lot of baloney he was laying it straight and he trusted us to be able to have that conversation without fear or reprisal he even told us where the bad guys were and everything
6439440 our mission differentiates every night but our main goal is to clean up the streets and help rebuild abu tshir and give abu tshir back to the people so they can live a free life
6439441 right now it seems like nobody is out here but we know that extremists are somewhere around
6439442 they scatter like the rats when they see the headlights
6439443 that is our only focus no matter what it takes to get it done
6439444 they acted like there was a curfew in effect even though there wasnt they didnt mingle we didnt see the kids out playing we didnt see smiles i think they were really scared of what they had coming
6439445 the strategic planning put us exactly where we are at today even though the public and a lot of government officials didnt have faith it really pulled us through
6439446 we try to keep them updated as far as what we know is happening and what is in the works
6439447 if we can keep them in a good flow of information we hope that buys a little more patience and that patience is our survival
6439448 these are some of the best iraqi national police i have ever worked with the best iraqi security forces i have ever worked with
6439449 i do believe that theyre getting it and i believe theyre getting it from our example
6439450 the national police also go out on their own they do their own patrols
6439451 they are really high speed i would compare them to a joe the way that they react is like a regular u s army soldier
6439452 but as we started doing close encounters and started talking to the people i dont think that reputation is true any more
6439453 were always going to have spikes in enemy activity but i think overall were going to be able to maintain
6439454 people are changing theyre accepting our help and at the same time they want us out of here so i think they are starting to realize that if they work with us well help them a lot more
6439455 its about personal preparedness to be prepared for the first 72 hours after an emergency situation occurs
6439456 we want people to consider how theyll notify their families and where theyll meet
6439457 its all about the multiple disasters we could face that could disrupt lives
6439458 this is a conference that has taken a lot of other conferences and put them all together
6439459 by its mere name tells us its about coming together as one in a promise a promise to work for the same goals have the same mission and understand that were all playing for the same team
6439460 theres not a community in southwest oklahoma that has not benefited from their close ties to fort sill
6439461 never have so many owed so much to so few
6439462 this is the third longest war in our nations history
6439463 every man or woman wearing a uniform is a volunteer and their families are volunteers as well their families are an integral part of that partnership
6439464 our soldiers is what this day is all about all of us today have to take a back seat to them the soldiers are the backbone of this country they serve this country with honor and dignity and they deserve a day like today everyday
6439465 fort sill is both proud and grateful as we acknowledge the long standing partnership with southwest oklahoma that has truely stood the test of time
6439466 we can trace our partnership as far back as 1901 when fort sill housed 29 future lawtonians as they waited to go claim their land

6439471 it is important that the two clubs reach an agreement so i can go
6439472 this is an opportunity that comes around only once everton are proposing 1 1million a year while at rennes i do not even receive half of that even if i do everything for this club i have a family to feed without counting the challenge which is very interesting
6439473 i am delighted to be here i need games and this is a great place to get them
6439474 i was a right back myself and believe me this lad has a lot to offer us
6439475 i have often been called a nazi and although it is unfair i dont let it bother me i dont let it bother me for one simple reason no one has ever had a sexual fantasy about being tied to a bed and ravished by a liberal
6439476 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade but let me speak more generally about the issue

6439523 we talk and stuff sometimes at school a lot of kids dont know what its like to have your parents in the military and you move a lot and you have to make new friends all over again and they dont know how you feel if something happens
6439524 it makes you feel like thats what our parents are doing so you can do it too
6439525 now that im in high school and they dont really have high schools on base you dont really make as many friends who actually have military backgrounds
6439526 its just cool having friends again who have parents who have been deployed and stuff like that
6439527 its been awesome theres a different respect level we get from these kids
6439528 we get a lot of yes sirs and no sirs they are very very respectful kids
6439529 the kids are extremely appreciative of it they seem to really love it and our staff is totally in to this and just spending time with these kids and showing the kids that we do care about them this is a way i see that were helping out our country too

6439585 i want to write an article about the arrest of video journalist brian conley
6439586 the fact is there are echoes of what happened before with firefly so some people are worried
6439587 my response to that is first of all thanks im glad you care and also you can be worried the show could have all the support in the world from fox and still not be successful theres no guarantees in this business the fact is their support hasnt wavered but they did sort of view what id done as a little bit different from what id sold

6439601 it wasnt a question of doing everything differently although they changed the ending it was mostly a matter of doing everything wrong they said the lines mostly but they said them all wrong and they cast it wrong and they designed it wrong and they scored it wrong they did everything wrong that they could possibly do theres actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking because everything that they did reflects back to the script or looks like something from the script and people assume that if i hated it then theyd changed the script but it wasnt so much that theyd changed the script its that they just executed it in such a ghastly fashion as to render it almost unwatchable

6439629 much to the surprise of my family and close friends im being obedient doing what the doctors tell me to do
6439630 those doctors say im responding well although the treatments will continue the outlook is good im optimistic most of all i feel fine and i anticipate resuming a full work schedule

6439639 ik heb bruinzeel gebeld en hij moest er eerst een kwartiertje over nadenken vertelt initiatiefneemster jeanne bouwmeester
6439640 toen belde hij terug met de mededeling dat hij geen smoking meer had dan kom je toch in je spijkerbroek zei ik hij heeft volmondig ja gezegd
6439641 bruinzeel heeft vroeger als schoolkind zelf ook op de markt staan zingen hij is dus bekend met de liedjes de partituren die nog bij pierre lagen hebben we inmiddels gescand en naar hem toe gestuurd
6439642 most customers wont want rainforest destruction and climate change in every mouthful of cookies or crackers so our plan is to start with the most prominent brands once we get some of the top brands on our side well use the power of the pocketbook to convince the a b cs adm bunge and cargill that destroying rainforests and increasing climate change isnt smart for business or the planet
6439643 we are currently working towards having all of our company owned plantations officially rspo certified as quickly as possible in 2008
6439644 theres currently no palm oil in the world that can be proven to be sustainable
6439645 its really important for the market to step up and create demand
6439646 global production could be doubled by planting palm trees on degraded areas of borneo
6439647 the advantage is that not a tree would have to be cut
6439648 in het improvement center doen we vooral onderzoek zegt hij
6439649 were going to have to cut more or were going to have to tighten our belts even more so tougher decisions are going to have to be made
6439650 there has to be some give somewhere in order to do that and thats an ongoing conversation
6439651 ive never worked for a government or public entity that explicitly put money for raises in the budget
6439652 that would certainly be my fantasy i dont know that that is going to happen
6439653 thats what we would like to see happen now we have to work with the pft and the other unions to see if we can make that happen
6439654 we want to do a financial plan that strategically looks over five years and includes costs for raises but that cant happen unless we look at some of this give and take
6439655 when asked about an hbcu she had no knowledge of what it was this is a major problem when 75 percent of graduating classes attend hbcus

6439658 chris understood that his continuing presence in the office would be a distraction
6439659 i have taken this action because it is in the councilmans best interest and the best interest of the citizens of philadelphia
6439660 its nice that they structured it in a way that made chris look as good as possible

6439663 ras proteins exist in all cells anchored to the inside of the cell membrane where they regulate cell growth and cell division the enzyme we are studying helps ras proteins get anchored to the cell membrane by blocking this enzyme we were able to inhibit the binding of ras proteins to cell membranes and greatly improve the disease symptoms in mice with blood cancer
6439664 when we inhibited the production of the enzyme the development of blood cancer declined and the uncontrolled growth of bone marrow cells was blocked another discovery was that normal bone marrow cells were not significantly affected by the icmt enzyme the means that future drugs for inhibiting icmt could specifically target the pathogenic cells and leave normal cells intact a drub that blocks this enzyme could be an effective future cancer treatment

6439668 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
6439669 georgian prime minister vladimer lado gurgenidze jewish made a special call to israel tuesday morning to receive a blessing from one of the haredi communitys most important rabbis and spiritual leaders rabbi aharon leib steinman

6439673 new college decided to address this situation as part of a rolling upgrade of its security facilities and enhance the system with a modern state of the art mifare contactless access system this would need to be fully capable of integrating with and working alongside the existing system until it was eventually replaced while providing full audit trail information and control of student movement
6439674 open spaces fields and watermelons olive and almond trees i remember the horse that was tied to the mulberry tree in the yard and how i climbed on to it and was thrown off and got a beating from my mother i remember the butterflies and the clear feeling that everything was open the village stood on a hill and everything was spread out below
6439675 to jess and heather with love and peace and prayers and somehow joy
6439676 instead here is a case where processing is positive in terms of enhancing absorption of lycopene
6439677 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
6439678 some people like to cook tomato sauce for prolonged periods sometimes reheating it day after day because it tastes better on the second and third day they add fat by using oil or meat and thats going to start to induce cis isomers of lycopene if fat is present and the cooking continues
6439679 so its possible people could induce this process and increase lycopene absorption by routine food preparation procedures as well
6439680 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 an ounce
6439681 there are many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can use hydrogen as fuel how to make it how to transport it how to create the infrastructure for people to fill their cars with it
6439682 our research lends itself to whats called a distributed production strategy instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralized facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6439683 precious metals have high catalytic activity and in most cases high stability but theyre also very expensive so our goal from the outset was to come up with a precious metal free catalyst one that was based on metals that are readily available and inexpensive but still highly active and stable so that sets us apart from most of the other groups in the world
6439684 whenever a process works at a lower temperature that brings energy savings and cost savings
6439685 also if the catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields we dont need as much of it that will bring down the size of the reactor and its cost
6439686 we can see that the magnetic fields are crucial for these complex filaments both for their survival and for their integrity

6439707 our study confirms that women experience significant bone loss due to cancer treatments and that zoledronic acid can prevent this loss
6439708 while our findings are promising its too early for us to recommend this drug for all premenopausal women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer because we dont yet have all the information we need on dosing cost effectiveness and whether this drug actually prevents bone fractures
6439709 however this research does show we need to be more vigilant about monitoring patients bone densities before and during treatment so we can protect bone health and offset bone fracture or osteoporosis risk

6439731 south africa and the world is facing a crisis of meaning in the workplace and only a major shift in the way we understand business will change this
6439732 it is axiomatic that our true value lies in our capacity to make a contribution for the greater good therefore contribution is central to bringing meaning back into the workplace employees who want to work for purpose and meaning rather than a mere salary would do well to ensure that their prospective employers vision and mission is oriented on contribution rather than greed and taking
6439733 business chasing a pure profit motive sees people purely as resource or human capital from which the maximum material value must be extracted and this nurtures a climate where people work purely for material gain employees echo their hires behaviour and go into the workplace with a take or greed mentality research shows that material wealth is no guarantee of meaning nor happiness and the real clues to finding these illusive states of mind lie in contribution or in being in service the challenge to business is to recreate workplaces where people are empowered to serve and find meaning through this

6439771 it may seem strange that transporting our unwanted paper and plastic bottles such a distance would actually be better for the environment but that is what the evidence from this study shows
6439772 as more and more of this material is being sold to china we wanted to know the impact that was having on the environment and specifically whether the co2 emissions from the transport outweighed the benefits of the recycling
6439773 although this study is only part of the environmental impact story it is clear that there are significant co2 savings that can be made by shipping our unwanted paper and plastic to china
6439774 in some cases we just arent able to reprocess everything we collect or there isnt enough of it to do so in these cases shipping it to china which has a high demand and need for material makes sense in co2 terms

6439776 unite britains biggest union is today raising serious concerns at the likelihood of baa being forced to sell 3 of the uks 7 airports

6439778 airports are an essential part of the uks transport infrastructure they are the gateway to our nation and further development and expansion is central to plans for economic growth and success
6439779 if what is being said is that the privatisation of the uks airport infrastructure has failed as it has following the sell off many other areas of privatised infrastructure and utilities perhaps now it is the time to bring this essential infrastructure back under public control

6439805 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power
6439806 thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
6439807 a very dangerous game and perhaps one that i suggest the russians want to reconsider this is not one that is cost free
6439808 that is an objective that will be denied because georgian democracy stands and it will stand with the help of its allies around the world
6439809 georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt georgias economy will be reinforced

6439811 okay im came to the lighthouse basically about three weeks ago because i was homeless
6439812 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6439813 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6439814 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie

6439816 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6439817 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6439818 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional

6439820 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6439821 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6439822 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6439823 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6439829 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6439830 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa

6439832 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana

6439834 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6439835 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

6439840 several times during the match when a band of about a dozen americans high in the stands began chanting u s a chinese fans responded with loud booing by the standards of professional baseball basketball or soccer the reaction was mild but it was an unusual breach of the graciousness china has shown at the olympics
6439841 the unseeded korean pair in contrast quickly left the arena and refused to talk with waiting reporters a small section of korean fans meanwhile were booed and at least one object was flung into the arena

6439845 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6439846 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6439847 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6439848 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6439849 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6439850 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6439851 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6439852 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6439853 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6439854 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6439855 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6439856 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6439857 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6439858 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6439859 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6439860 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6439861 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6439862 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6439863 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6439864 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6439865 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6439866 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena

6439871 vandalism is a fact of life that we have to live with
6439872 boc knowingly assisted hamas and the islamic jihad to carry out terrorist attacks with the full approval of the chinese government and rejected requests by the israeli government to cease and desist boc even had the chutzpah to make these funds transfers through its u s branches right under the nose of the u s justice department despite the fact that hamas and the pij are designated terrorist organizations and that such wire transfers are a crime under american law we expect boc to now pay very heavily for its support for terrorism

6439875 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6439876 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6439877 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6439878 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6439879 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6439880 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6439881 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6439882 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6439883 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6439884 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6439885 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6439886 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6439887 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6439888 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6439889 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6439890 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6439891 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6439892 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

6439894 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6439895 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6439896 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6439897 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6439898 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6439899 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6439900 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6439901 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6439902 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6439903 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6439904 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6439905 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6439906 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6439907 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6439908 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6439909 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6439910 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6439911 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6439912 global demand for all types of energy has risen steeply and supplies of finite resources like oil and gas are under intense pressure
6439913 the world is experiencing an energy shock of a kind not seen since the early 1970s but which is likely to have more profound and lasting consequences
6439914 the prices we all pay for electricity and gas are ultimately determined by the law of supply and demand in a global economy this is what lies behind much of the dramatic increase in wholesale energy prices we have experienced
6439915 denver teachers object to changes in pay for performance plan
6439916 we almost never sat down with our principals to say where are our students now where do they need to be and how do we get them there this really has changed the culture in our schools
6439917 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6439918 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6439919 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6439920 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6439921 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6439922 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6439923 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6439924 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6439925 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6439926 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6439927 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6439928 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6439929 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6439930 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6439931 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6439932 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6439933 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6439934 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6439935 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6439936 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6439937 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6439938 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6439939 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6439940 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6439941 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6439942 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6439943 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6439944 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6439945 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6439946 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6439947 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6439948 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6439955 die vielzahl der tarife und sonderaktionen sorgt nicht zwangsl ufig f r mehr wechselbereitschaft beim kunden viele kunden bleiben lieber ihrem anbieter treu als sich mit dem tarifwirrwarr auseinanderzusetzen
6439956 da helfen auch die t glichen call center attacken der anbieter nicht weiter um den kunden mit halbseidenen angeboten zu berrumpeln und ihm teure vertr ge aufzuschwatzen das f hrt im endergebnis noch zu einer h heren ver rgerung der verbraucher
6439957 die praxis zeigt dass es vielen tk unternehmen nicht gelingt ihren werbespr chen gerecht zu werden sie schlagen sich anscheinend lieber in ihren kundendienst abteilungen mit den auswirkungen und symptomen schlecht konzipierter produkte und services herum und bet tigen sich in der brandbek mpfung ohne die ursachen wirklich zu beheben

6439960 diese mehrfach kontakte werden dann zum echten problem wenn anfragen ber unterschiedliche eingangskan le nicht einem vorgang zugeordnet werden k nnen diese f higkeit besitzen leider die wenigsten unternehmen zudem gibt es oftmals keine ad quate m glichkeit einfache vorg nge schnell selbst zu erledigen wer es gewohnt ist seine fl ge online zu buchen den telefonischen quick check in bevorzugt und sitzplatzreservieren per sms liebt der hat wenig spa bei den meisten angeboten der telefonfirmen zur selbstadministration per telefon oder im internet

6439970 it says the public should be allowed to do as they please in public if they are not breaking the law and accuses some police forces and councils of overstepping their legal powers by confiscating drinks without good reason
6439971 the group is calling on people to reclaim public spaces and plans to host a mass picnic to protest against drinking bans on bank holiday monday in londons hyde park
6439972 it claims the idea took off in 2001 when the criminal justice and police act introduced designated public place orders which allowed police officers to confiscate alcohol from drinkers and even arrest them a similar power to confiscate drink from teenagers was put in place in 1997
