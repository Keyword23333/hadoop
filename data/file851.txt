8510000 its going to be good in two days im sure
8510001 after that happened i was thinking more of it than i was really actually feeling the pain so its not really a big deal but in that moment i felt big pain its going to be all right
8510002 you just have so much fun being on the court
8510003 even playing first at 11 a m its not so many people but you feel special being on the central court im enjoying this city so much the crowd
8510004 there are women out there who are doing things in british tennis and its nice to know its well that its just not andy murray out there
8510005 its nice to kind of be with him at these events and share it with him
8510006 now is the biggest tournament and i didnt make so great result in grand slam its very important i will play very well here
8510007 very surprising i play good in the first round because always i would be nervous and confidence is not so great just in the beginning of the tournament
8510008 but i played good all three sets fighting good and very good concentration
8510009 believe me i sound and look much better than i feel
8510010 but we convinced them to serve us two tsing tsaos beers it was a highlight
8510011 the good news i dont have to run around and whack a ball i can just sit on my rear end and watch them do it
8510012 its part of what we do if you accept this as your job then you have to accept the lifestyle that goes with it
8510013 i was in pretty good shape until donald young won the fourth set
8510014 i had to have them make me another cappuccino there was no chance i was going to make the fifth set without some kind of boost
8510015 the problem is i go back to the hotel at 1 a m and was wide awake for two hours so donald youngs excellent showing cost me a couple of hours of sleep
8510016 working with the same people for so long 16 years with john mcenroe and 20 years with tracy austin you dont have that luxury in our business very often
8510017 its tough to play one of the best returners in the game without a serve
8510018 i had plan a b c and d and i had to play plan f
8510019 whatever is laudable in our works proceeds from the grace of god
8510020 i was found by those who did not seek me i was made manifest to those who did not ask for me
8510021 god made man of the dust of the earth man gave ear to the devil
8510022 so im kinda just filling up this area just underneath the skin
8510023 and within this area that she sweats theres gonna be about 10 to 20 injections
8510024 you chose your outfit by what didnt show sweat and you chose not to raise your hand you chose not to go to some social settings because it was the events that would be more active and you would sweat more and that is what you didnt want people to see
8510025 it stops these nerves from transmitting to these encrine glands so that they dont secrete sweat
8510026 if someone has excessive sweating which interferes with their daily activities those are the people that are given the diagnosis of hyperhidrosis and those are the ones that can get treatment
8510027 hyperhidrosis can certainly lead to social isolation it can lead to depression and anxiety disorders so its important for people to know that theres something available that can be done
8510028 the high costs will influence farmers to plant less it is difficult to predict by how much now
8510029 it is highly unlikely that they will be able to charge that amount and recover the money so farmers are going to plant less
8510030 farmers dont use roads a lot they do most of their commuting on farm roads
8510031 we are not asking for any input subsidy but they could perhaps subsidise the premiums
8510032 when you get an education that is something nobody can take from you money is only temporary but what you have in your head if you have the right kind of head stays with you
8510033 i was found by those who did not seek me i was made manifest to those who did not ask for me
8510034 its been busy but i look forward to working with all of you and getting to know your names
8510035 were going to spread the news of the pep rally by word of mouth
8510036 were undefeated at this rally notre dame is undefeated so its really going to be special
8510037 so far weve only had one non bog person show up but who knows if that will change
8510038 when we were handing out maps to the freshmen and their parents at check in we realized duncan hall wasnt on the map
8510039 theres more excitement because theres a lot of things we get to start
8510040 i remember all the hours hanging out with my section mates playing cards watching tv just building our community bond
8510041 people who have had experience with the menu wanted something new
8510042 you have the sweet and salty of prosciutto instead of regular ham the pancetta is cured and goes beyond the little nuances of regular bacon
8510043 both of them had great competitive seasons in the big east last year
8510044 their strengths are in the front row where they are tremendous hitters and blockers
8510045 it was a great compliment and i am going to just keep working along with the team to do our best
8510046 it was a surprise but its nice to be honored for the hard work in the last couple years
8510047 it is always nice to be honored but i would always pick team success over individual success i would love to trade it in for an ncaa title
8510048 both hit a high percentage as well as have high kills and they are also very good blockers
8510049 justine stremick is one of the best blockers that we have ever had in the program serinity phillips is usually on the outside and she is one of the best we have ever had out there as well
8510050 those are the strengths and numbers that allowed them to be able to be recognized as all conference players and i believe they are capable of doing much more this year and im excited about that
8510051 were both very competitive people we both learn from each other
8510052 even the time weve spent here it seems like its only been a matter of months but weve learned from each other greatly
8510053 what a lot of people dont remember is that its not a normal college system its an nfl system
8510054 youre making an even larger jump the terminology the verbiage and everything just jumps up
8510055 before the summer everyone from my town told me how great the cape cod league was
8510056 i just tried to take the same approach i always do and fortunately it worked out for me
8510057 at one point its pretty incredible and its a thrill
8510058 but at the same time im sure there are a lot of guys on that list of past mvps that youve never heard of
8510059 now that im a junior some people might expect me to be a little more vocal
8510060 and im sure some of the guys will expect me to take on a more designated leadership role
8510061 another thing is im going to be used to added attention with all those scouts and fans at those games
8510062 ive had a good couple of years at notre dame but after competing with the best players in the country like that my confidence is obviously pretty high
8510063 it was incredible youve got the beach right there and the really nice town
8510064 the last six holes of stroke play was the highlight when my putter all of a sudden just got hot as i one putted the last six holes
8510065 den st rke pipeline bner for et stort potentiale s is r p lang sigt ser det positivt ud for cheminova
8510066 the results in the ita national summer championships are encouraging
8510067 dan stahl stephen havens tyler davis and matt johnson all represented notre dame well down there the bond in this years sophomore class is something that can carry us through the tough times
8510068 stephen havens did well to reach the semifinals not to mention good doubles results
8510069 i believe that zetia is clinically beneficial but i cannot prove that
8510070 everyone i know is losing their job companies are closing down and the price of everything is sky high i talk to people every day and there is hardly any hope
8510071 you can only get a good job if youre highly educated and even they are having trouble
8510072 nearly a decade of unaddressed worker concerns is contributing to rising anxiety as many americans think they cannot achieve or hold on to the middle class american dream
8510073 real wages did not increase in the last four or five years for most americans
8510074 you have to invest in yourself and the government should be a partner in this
8510075 some employers do this but most face too much competition and cost pressure most small and medium sized companies cannot afford to train their work force
8510076 have an informal hiring freeze and there is some stress on workers to do more with less
8510077 the career track of the future might be more fragmented with two or three or four different careers during your work life
8510078 people need to be autonomous enough to develop skills we have to consume less and invest more government has a role in ensuring that education and learning resources are widely accessible and people have access to them
8510079 but several of my friends work for banks and theyre losing their jobs
8510080 im luckier than most people but i have a general angst because i know people who are out of work
8510081 to move out on my own and have a decent life
8510082 and bookbutterfly to tell you the truth you most likely wont find it
8510083 the rules seemed to change and they told me it had to be one word so i tried censorship but they didnt like that and then said it had to be no more than six letters long
8510084 hi we were at the great clips salon in bel air 37th amp woodlawn wichita ks a few weeks ago waiting for grandma to get her hair cut when my son found a camera memory card on the floor no one in the store knew whose card it was
8510085 i found a camera while at ocean city md on june 26 2008 i stepped on the camera while wading in about 3 feet of water it is a fuji finepix a200 digital camera being an it professional and somewhat of a tinkerer i tried to salvage the camera with no luck i was able to salvage the memory card and pull all of the pictures off of it
8510086 this was in isle of skye back in the end of april 2008 i gave a ride to a backpacker hosteler down to a hiking area and found this the next day while cleaning up the car prior to returning to the rental agency
8510087 im from hong kong and i work at the star ferry company a tourist lost his digital camera during the chinese new year in february this year he joined the star ferrys harbour tour from wan chai pier and alighted there too after he finished the tour i handed the camera to the inspector and sent back to me three months later after no one came to claim for it
8510088 im really excited for the show to premiere so then i stop getting asked the question because i never know which way to go
8510089 its kind of got a bit of everything i dont think its genre specific i think that it is very science fiction but more emphasis on the science as opposed to the fiction theres drama because your characters are all real but theyre dealing with these horrific scenarios so i think theres elements of horror theres elements of action theres investigative stories theres crime solving i mean its just all consuming and far reaching
8510090 and i think that as the show progresses they will need each other more and more and more
8510091 the power of threes a fun little number because the dynamic is always going to shift and youre always going to need one person more than the other i was brought up in a family of three and theres always two people against one
8510092 theres some fairly gruesome things that have happened to be honest with you and some fairly bizarre things and im not going to tell you any more because thats to be revealed
8510093 but i think everyone will find them interesting and just close enough to reality to possibly go oh my goodness thats weird and i dont want to tell you im not going to tell you any more
8510094 the only original cast member from the original series is leonard nimoy
8510095 ive only met the people who own the locations we are using and have not gotten into meeting anyone for whom this is more than fiction
8510096 she told me about when she first moved to l
8510097 and she said you mean they all work at night
8510098 i didnt know about these alternative communities it certainly does help
8510099 they actually talk to vampires and interview them in their vampire communities some of them have actually had dental work done so they really do have fangs
8510100 the only original cast member from the original series is leonard nimoy
8510101 just to let you know im now charging 10 an hour more than last year do you still want to come in
8510102 gopalan nair are charged that you on or about may 29 2008 in singapore did intentionally offer an insult to a public servant namely justice belinda ang saw een a judge of the supreme court of singapore while the judge was sitting in judicial proceedings namely notice of assessment no
8510103 the following transpired during the last 3 days in court the judge belinda ang was throughout prostituting herself during the entire proceedings by being nothing more than an employee of mr lee kuan yew and his son and carrying out their orders
8510104 glancing through the pages very quickly i suggested that he would have instead
8510105 your judge lai siu chiu has no shame the reason why she and her fellow judges punish and silence pap critics are because judges are well paid and have comfortable lives they are selling their souls and their conscience for money they are misusing the law for personal gain your singapore judges including lai are corrupt judges
8510106 we are routinely approached by writers and filmmakers interested in telling

8510108 everyone except hillary clintons supporters seems to be pleased with the choice of senator joseph biden as senator barack obamas choice of vp theres a lot of attention on bidens negative comments about obama and positive comments towards mccain but thats really semantics the real issue that everyone should be focusing on isnt even in the press yet and i doubt theyll even investigate or publicize this if they knew anyway prepare for something youll only find on asp
8510109 the number of complainants might increase until august 20 the public prosecution recorded 3 458 complaints from individuals and the total financial claims against al boom are around dh847 266 000 his frozen assets cover about 15 per cent of the total claims
8510110 al booms case gained public and media interest and was surrounded by different rumours our main legal responsibility is to recover the claimants money most of the depositors have a limited income
8510111 i will remain optimistic we aim to recover the claimants money
8510112 the investigation continues and a committee of financial experts from the rulers court is currently examining the case
8510113 my client didnt have any intention of swindling any of the depositors he has been trying to return the depositors money by selling his projects
8510114 the total investment of the project is expected to be about 3bn 2bn 1 6bn
8510115 we expect the new regulation to eliminate such anomalies in the system
8510116 the new law aims to help regulate the emirates booming real estate sector and boost investor confidence in the property market
8510117 it is good for developers and investors it stands as a proof of ownership in the event of any dispute between developers and master developers
8510118 it brings order to the market and adds confidence people can now make informed decisions about this market
8510119 otherwise it would have been a big disaster because there were people looking in the showroom
8510120 i could have killed somebody i could have killed myself
8510121 and this fall we are going to pick up more seats
8510122 and this fall we are going to pick up more seats
8510123 there were people who supported the war and people who opposed the war inside that convention hall
8510124 but what people are unified about is that when we make a decision to go to war that it should not be ideologically driven that it should be driven by a set of facts and common sense with regards to how we mobilize our country and our national interest
8510125 and i think that there is a strong feeling that even among those that supported george bushs decision initially to go in that there was some fudging of the numbers and shading of the truth and that as a consequence of our inability to create a strong alliance around our actions that we are now stuck in a quagmire that is going to cost us not only billions of dollars but thousands of lives and will require a much longer term commitment than the american voters had intended when they rallied behind the president
8510126 well how does electing john kerry resolve that dilemma for america
8510127 if you look at what has happened over the last several months i think there is a convergence basically the bush administration has moved in the direction of its critics in trying to internationalize the reconstruction process so i am not sure that on paper the differences between the bush administration and a kerry administration would be significant
8510128 presidents often talk about the importance of their personal relations with other leaders but essentially that is a lot of hooey you know nations do things because of national interest
8510129 whether john kerry is in the white house or george bush is in the white house that is not going to cause the french or the germans or the russians or others who do not see it in their national interest to be engaged in iraq right now to suddenly say well john i like you a lot better than i liked george
8510130 i do not think that it is a function of like or dislike i think that what our allies look at is a consistent disdain for world opinion that culminated in iraq but that did not start in iraq unilateral rejection of the
8510131 all of this culminating in iraq leading up to iraq but a pattern established that the united states is not interested in our national interest that they do not want to sit down at our table and how to figure out how this is good for us as well as the united states theyre willing to make their own decisions
8510132 it is that pattern on the part of the bush administration that i think has made it so difficult for us to craft the kind of strategies that we need in hot areas like the middle east
8510133 but do you think that most the delegates on the floor really understand that president kerry is not going to pursue a policy in iraq that is essentially different from the one that george bush is pursuing
8510134 i think that they recognize that we cannot afford to simply cut and run in iraq and that we are in a difficult situation right now and i think that what they are hoping for is somebody who is going to bring a thoughtfulness and a base of experience to decision making in the white house which john kerry possesses and i think that george bush does not
8510135 well ted you have been there and i have not
8510136 i do not know whether or not we can accomplish that in six months if we can then i think john kerry will bring our troops home
8510137 my assumption would be that if we could actually stabilize iraq in such a way that you do not have warfare between the sunnis the shiias and the kurds some semblance of law and order in that country then i think that there is no doubt that the kerry administration is going to be interested in bringing back the reservists and the national guardsmen who are currently there but
8510138 i think it is also true that the bush administration would bring the troops back
8510139 well but as i said before part of what we are struggling with here part of what is at stake is not simply the decision making in iraq
8510140 what is at stake is an overall approach to foreign policy that has been characterized in the bush administration by unilateralism and a disdain for world opinion that has concrete consequences over time
8510141 we got a driver who drove the bus into the ditch now we can argue about how that happened but weve got to get the bus out of the ditch that does not mean you dont fire the driver and the question is who do we trust over the long term to direct our foreign policy in a way that meets international interests makes us strong here at home creates the kind of or restores us to kind of respect that weve had in the past abroad and i think that the estimation of those in the convention is that they trust john kerry to make those decisions better than george bush will make those decisions
8510142 it is clear by this stage of the evenings entertainment that the barrel of stock army characters and situations has been tapped dry and the musical form is a means of recycling
8510143 romantic musical about the loneliness of a boy kept far away from his girl
8510144 the non profit service sector has never been richer more powerful
8510145 faith based grassroots organization organizing and advocating for social change
8510146 have become thinly veiled excuses for cutting back on social programs which are anathema to a conservative agenda
8510147 its always easier to organize around intolerance narrow mindedness and false nostalgia
8510148 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
8510149 the operation is over we killed third militant early today thursday
8510150 dangerous and demeaning work that robs them of their childhood and often their future
8510151 in many countries child labor inspectors do not receive adequate training and are vulnerable to corruption due to low salaries
8510152 there is a broad array of efforts now underway to eliminate the worst forms of child labor
8510153 this report reveals that many governments are demonstrating the will to change childrens lives but it also makes clear that there is much more still to do to protect children around the world from exploitive child labor
8510154 while the report showed a decline in the incidence of child labor around the world there are still millions of undocumented children working under hazardous and exploitive conditions
8510155 many of these children are forced to endure horrendous hardships because their survival depends on it and their families rely on their income
8510156 hong kong and macao are a door into china two cities where there is a strong european and asian culture a great variety of establishments and 30 million tourists a year
8510157 yeah thats it and i write the checks so i know
8510158 its like two little puddles of water coming together there is no splash there is no news
8510159 matthews but i think if its mitt romney or its pawlenty its not interesting
8510160 it sounds like something you order on the side with a dinner
8510161 look when keith anchors he plays it straight down the line
8510162 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8510163 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8510164 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8510165 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8510166 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution
8510167 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8510168 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8510169 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8510170 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8510171 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8510172 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8510173 if nine of us are arrested you must continue to rally here
8510174 its our victory that police did not storm and arrest us last night
8510175 at this moment there are more than 10 000 protesters inside
8510176 they will prepare documents and hopefully by early afternoon police will enter government house with a court injunction and arrest warrants to meet with protest leaders
8510177 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8510178 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8510179 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8510180 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8510181 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution
8510182 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8510183 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8510184 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8510185 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8510186 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8510187 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8510188 we are also grateful for all the expressions of public support and solidarity received during the difficult weeks of his captivity
8510189 there is no need to panic because we are ensuring that arvs are delivered on time
8510190 the shortage is temporary and it is global because of the increased demand worldwide
8510191 in view of a number of wealthy cambodians and a growing number of foreign investors arriving in cambodia we are confident gold tower 42 will be a success
8510192 cambodia really needs this kind of class a facility by the time the project is built the demand will be there
8510193 i think if everything goes smoothly as planned all of the satellite city projects will break ground by 2009
8510194 to my knowledge the satellite city projects are moving ahead on schedule and i dont see any of them as likely to fail
8510195 cambodia offers the best reward to risk profile in the region now as competition is still low and the country has such vast potential
8510196 cambodia has untapped oil and gas reserves large amounts of fertile agricultural land low labour costs a stable democratic political system and a dollarized economy with no capital controls where companies can be 100 percent foreign owned
8510197 cb richard ellis is carefully evaluating the market with a view to market entrance we dont have a company here yet but we are writing business and we have the right to assign those contracts back over to the cambodian company when and if its operational
8510198 cambodia is now acceptable the cambodian peoples party has done a very good job in this department
8510199 relying on a lease in a country where the rule of law is not yet fully developed and the court system is notoriously corrupt is a deterrent for foreign investment in the real estate sector
8510200 my agreement was made with a handshake and a look in the eyes the decision was now or never either you do it or you spend a life time running behind prices i am aware i might lose the land from one day to the next i depend entirely on my cambodian business partner but i have no doubt that he will keep his word
8510201 this was why god put the ticket in his hands
8510202 called me invited me to his home told me he had won and his intentions he said he wanted to bless the church that this was why god put the ticket in his hands
8510203 it just shows his fertility is very high dr lynch said
8510204 when you look at it under a microscope its very concentrated very mobile and now weve had great success with the first two attempts two ais and two pregnancies thats the proof of the pudding
8510205 everyone thought oh thats so cute it just makes it real it just shows life and its really nice to see the calf moving around
8510206 this is the first pregnancy at the zoo its not just the first birth we have to manage the pregnancy manage the birth shes a first time mum dr lynch said
8510207 shes certainly a bit more clingy than usual id say when we come out in the paddock we do spend quite a bit of time with the elephants here and its not unusual for her just to follow you round the paddock
8510208 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security

8510210 the figures from the dsa show a considerable discrepancy between the pass rates for drivers in parts of wales
8510211 it does appear much harder to pass a driving test in north wales than for instance in parts of west wales
8510212 i will be writing to the dsa to find out if there are any local reasons for such a significant difference in pass rates across wales
8510213 im sure learner drivers would expect to be treated the same wherever they take their test
8510214 waiting times for driving tests also vary considerably which might suggest that there are not enough examiners in some areas
8510215 for instance there is a wait of three months in llanelli but half that time in cardiff or newport
8510216 the wealthier the town area the more likely people are able to invest more money on lessons and will have more opportunities for private practise and access to family vehicles etc
8510217 it would be highly improbable that every test centre would return the same pass rate country wide
8510218 every instructor around here will tell you that the pass rate is very low and were all worried about it
8510219 none of us know the reason why but for example this morning i took a girl for a test in chester because shed failed twice in mold and she sailed through

8510234 ive always just been amazed with the trucks as a kid i sat around drawing pictures of trucks
8510235 when youre up on that podium looking out over that crowd of 374 drivers and their spouses and friends 350 of them would like to be up in your spot its pretty prestigious

8510242 theyre a larger event than we are and we support each other
8510243 the great thing about naperville is the great sense of volunteerism
8510244 what we came up with is a way to save and salvage the private property rights of the cobbs as well as pleasing the community by saving the property and preserving its heritage
8510245 this does not mean that some individual cant come in and just purchase the property to restore it themselves
8510246 it doesnt alleviate any other option of someone doing it but were trying to be proactive to come up with some good options because we have not seen anyone else come up with anything
8510247 were going to be in the parade with a couple of hybrids cars
8510248 hybrids want to run on electricity at those slower speeds
8510249 anything we can do to help individuals understand what he or she can do what their part is we need each individual to do their part
8510250 we need everybody not just businesses not just industry we need individuals
8510251 this administration has redeployed them until they are overstretched stressed and strained
8510252 barack obama understands that for a commander in chief to support the military he needs more than a mission accomplished banner more than a borrowed flight suit and definitely more than four more years of the same failed foreign policy
8510253 barack obama stands out because he understands that people want government to work for them again
8510254 during these tough economic times he is deeply concerned for our children our families and those who have been left behind
8510255 she would love this she would enjoy every minute of it
8510256 we pick women from the audience to do the judging and there is no bribing allowed

8510259 we have no reason to believe he was deliberately harmed
8510260 id like to think that people would think of me as a good servant of the richmond football club and a good quality player that has done his best for richmond
8510261 my form has been pretty good this year so im not going to cancel out a chance of going on next year ill put my hat in the ring and see what happens
8510262 weve always felt this was a county issue unfortunately because these folks are outside our jurisdiction we were limited in our options
8510263 probably result in criminal or civil proceedings down the line
8510264 if you dont jump on it youre going to lose to someone else
8510265 our communities are interested in it but weve got to keep that interest going
8510266 its also scoping out the job its basically putting a design together
8510267 they are great test takers and they produce a large number of engineers and scientists
8510268 but its a system that doesnt put up with creative people look at me i ran away all the creative people come to the united states or other countries

8510281 the whole purpose of the event is to draw people from all nationalities of asian background
8510282 also to bring in non asians to showcase the culture and the arts
8510283 chinese is different from japanese thai is different from laos
8510284 children will dress up in chinese outfits we have two koreans and there will be some cambodian and many laotian outfits
8510285 usually you dont get to see these costumes unless someone is getting married or experiencing some significant event in their lives so for them to go on stage and display it is amazing
8510286 to cut it to their size and fit it its probably another hundred hours
8510287 not the kind of thing you would see in a typical home
8510288 it is a cross between soccer volleyball and a mix of a bit of gymnastics and martial arts
8510289 the basic object is theres a hollow ball the size of a grapefruit and keep it airborne with your feet knees elbow shoulder everything except the hands
8510290 its a great spectator sport because people are doing acrobatics in the air and hitting the ball

8510295 i think this is an excellent opportunity for anybody who wants to meet or learn more about asian culture
8510296 most of the people you will meet there will be very easy to communicate with because they are second and third generation asian americans
8510297 this is one time you can actually take in the asian culture without even leaving elgin
8510298 its amazing how you lose your muscle tone and mass when youre not using it
8510299 at the last count i had heard over 400 and i know more came in after that

8510304 weve greatly expanded and improved and introduced some new things to our family fun land area
8510305 its the same format as weve had in the past
8510306 its a nice way to build relationships between our youth and the police department
8510307 things came from schools from the area photographs from local families
8510308 it was the whole staffs effort and we are just happy we did it
8510309 it was doing all of the little stuff like turning off the lights
8510310 does hydroelectric power from the fox river make good economic sense

8510313 you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold
8510314 we didnt discover our values in a poll taken a week before the convention and we didnt set a weather vane on top of the golden gate bridge before we started talking about the american family the choices this year are not just between two different personalities or between two political parties they are between two different visions of the future two fundamentally different ways of governing their government of pessimism fear and limits or ours of hope confidence and growth
8510315 the pundits the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states red states for republicans blue states for democrats but ive got news for them too we worship an awesome god in the blue states and we dont like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states
8510316 lets tell the truth it must be done it must be done mr reagan will raise taxes and so will i he wont tell you i just did
8510317 there is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the cold war itself
8510318 it was the toughest thing ive had to do in 27 years in my profession
8510319 there was no one else to do it so we did it
8510320 the kane county health department will be conducting an on site inspection of the walter paytons roundhouse after several complaints about flies within the meals
8510321 please stay away until the kane county health department issues their official findings
8510322 i clearly meant it solely as a fyi to my colleagues
8510323 apparently the health department takes these complaints very seriously but it was not my intention to be mean spirited or shut down the roundhouse i just wanted peace of mind
8510324 the roundhouse had a bad day with flies and i had a bad day in judgment
8510325 but the measure of a man is how you bounce back and i will bounce back with professionalism and work to improve the overall business climate of aurora anyone who gives me a chance will see this was an isolated incident and is not a pattern or a trend of manny maysonet
8510326 suspended for five days without pay for his actions which she referred to as a misuse of city computers and e mail
8510327 we do not comment on personnel issues disciplinary measures or union negotiations

8510331 there have been re enactments at other locations where weve marched four miles with all the food on our backs and then camped out we want to show people that the equipment they had worked very well
8510332 to do it on an actual historic site an underground railroad site it really makes the whole fight come alive
8510333 we do this to honor the men that fought in that war and every other war so that people dont forget what they did for our country
8510334 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8510335 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8510336 that young democracy has been subjected to an unjustified assault and the international community has joined in condemning russias invasion of a sovereign democratic neighbor and its recognition of georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia

8510346 we conclude that even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making
8510347 this kind of learning had been suggested to be subconscious a century ago on the grounds that it was observed in some species like rats that were supposed to be deprived of conscious awareness

8510351 michaels body of work has changed the landscape for all documentary filmmakers
8510352 hes made clear that you can actually make a commercially viable documentary film
8510353 we dont bring movies to this festival that are mediocre or arent very good or it was a nice try
8510354 i think most documentary filmmakers nowadays are michael moore disciples
8510355 but its also a story of how people can beat the odds and survive
8510356 are ones that arise naturally as the result of telling good stories
8510357 were currently in a state of flux dealing with real estate scheduling vendors and retro fitting the building
8510358 but that could change as the demand for production in the state changes

8510362 the burden is always on the yes side to convince people there is good reason to vote for the measure
8510363 its a pretty classic supporting role with several scenes throughout and her own arc in the film
8510364 rays hair and mascara say that shes a woman and she cares to be pretty its something she did in high school when she met her husband and it worked then so maybe itll work now

8510411 on behalf of the great state of new york with appreciation for the spirit and dedication of all who are gathered here with eyes firmly fixed on the future with the spirit of unity lets declare all together with one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8510412 again and again john mccain has been wrong and barack obama was right
8510413 development that needed our immediate attention there is nothing unusual about it it was deferred nothing unusual about it it happens several times
8510414 governance is dynamic you cannot be a prisoner to any particular programme brazil is an important country to nigeria very important and we intend to keep that our respect for them remains very strong and our inability to come on this trip does not in any way affect our respect for them and they are looking forward to when the president will make the trip

8510419 americans who travel abroad for the first time are often shocked to discover that despite all the progress that has been made in the last 30 years many foreign people still speak in foreign languages
8510420 uhh you know we need a change made and we need it right away
8510421 we can vet the code against the requirements before its pushed we can do sensible easy quality control and it doesnt even mean a lot of work for us
8510422 i dont think it is in telstras interest to be trying to squeeze the last bit of bitter lemon out of work choices
8510423 it will certainly say to telstra and to other companies that if a majority of the employees want to try collectively bargaining then the employer has to join them at the bargaining table and have a go at it in good faith
8510424 widely recognised as an employer of choice offering competitive remuneration and a very broad range of benefits for employees
8510425 i spent the first couple of weekends working in the office
8510426 i was surprised to see people who lived locally who brought their friends to barbecues there
8510427 because its a performance based culture if you have a good track record thats great
8510428 the bonus could run up very quickly depending on your performance
8510429 for most of the people i know the working arrangements were very flexible
8510430 a lot of people were there for less than a year and were able to have kids get time off be able to work from home two to three times a week
8510431 i can understand why ibm has won a few awards for their treatment of women in the workplace
8510432 what impressed me the most was the opportunity to grow not only locally but regionally and globally as well
8510433 i think its a situation thats held in other industries as well if you are working for a place that has a big presence in the market especially if youre straight out of university they can afford to underpay you
8510434 take for example the gasworks regeneration in south belfast its acknowledged that it has not met the needs of local communities
8510435 how are they learning those lessons how are they making sure local people are gaining employment gaining the housing issues tackling the education and unemployment problems as well
8510436 its not being done or least its evident in these plans
8510437 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house down last night
8510438 what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first thank you president clinton
8510439 the whole biden family on this journey with me to take america back
8510440 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the effort to take america back
8510441 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8510442 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8510443 it represents significant potential for annual fuel savings of almost 700 million gallons of gasoline and over 6 million tons per year of potential greenhouse gasses that could be eliminated
8510444 thats the equivalent of taking a million cars off the road
8510445 the product has already been tested by every major car company in the world
8510446 i would have voted for this lunch box if it were on the ballot
8510447 i wanted change so that i could have more change in my pocket
8510448 the goal of history is not to tell someone elses history for them but to enable those groups to tell their own histories with our capabilities
8510449 to engage into the complicating questions about how it is that we can interpret their history allows them to have a voice
8510450 to someday perhaps break those chains is exactly what i try to do when i rock the boat
8510451 this is a new contract for us but weve been developing training software for the department of defense the navy and national security agency for the past 15 years
8510452 so this contract dovetails nicely into what weve been doing in the past
8510453 this is a fantastic win for the techsoft team and were excited to be working on this large project in our own backyard
8510454 our experience with the navy both operationally and in training fits perfectly with its requirements
8510455 were a subcontractor to techsoft and will help them with their designs of web based training
8510456 we held this kind of training contract with the navy from 1998 to 2002 but now its more web based rather than software based
8510457 we were just trying to offer an alternative to a closure
8510458 the purpose of the board is to focus on affordable housing in century
8510459 we never had any discussion at any board meetings about a charter school application
8510460 the whole thing was to have a backup plan if carver century school closes
8510461 if there are holes in it as i understand it there would be a give and take with the district during the review process you couldnt even play in the game if you didnt have your application in by the deadline
8510462 people are just worried to death if they close it down the kids would be scattered everywhere
8510463 theyre tired theyre cold theyre hypodermic but they seem to be pretty aware of whats going on and our communications with them have been pretty good so far
8510464 were going to have to hope they have good weather use their sleeping bag and tough it out through the nigh so we can get our personnel up there
8510465 the concern was that the police department was spending entirely too much time out there
8510466 it got to the point when there were numerous complaints and the police department came to us
8510467 things didnt turn around so we had to consider other options
8510468 based on the calls for service the pub is definitely mandating department resources
8510469 its similar to the rocktown grill case but no criminal charges have been filed at this time
8510470 but its still a consideration that decision has not been made yet
8510471 once its explained in front of the board it shouldnt be a problem
8510472 i raised the prices and unfortunately that threw the percentage off
8510473 if it happens to you one time we work with you
8510474 if the ratio is close we will work with you and try to get you back on track but if its a chronic issue youre going to get charged she had three in a row
8510475 we noticed the numbers didnt match other numbers submitted to the city and the state those numbers should all match across the board
8510476 there are plenty of restaurants meeting and maintaining this ratio
8510477 its exceptional its outstanding to have every single school in our division make ayp this year
8510478 it speaks highly of our folks i just applaud all our employees for their focus to make a difference
8510479 we are very encouraged by the results of our ayp status nearly all our subgroups improved
8510480 if a school improves in pass rate from the year before i think thats exceptional
8510481 because of the slowing economy the volume of workers on summer furloughs was about 17 percent greater than in the 2007 summer vacation period
8510482 there is a difference in what i believe is my job as a legislator and what my personal convictions are
8510483 i dont feel the government should have the right to come in and tell during the first trimester what a woman can or cannot do with her body
8510484 people are looking for new and fresh ideas from an independent mind that has not been tainted by the system
8510485 one piece of a slumping economy is layoffs or position eliminations
8510486 after layoffs there are many people who are unhappy and who are looking for a remedy to the situation they are looking to blame others when there may not be any blame
8510487 when you are in the red and not in the black sometimes your employees are not getting along
8510488 we can instruct personnel on services to help them make transitions
8510489 maybe she lifted her arm up but i didnt see it
8510490 also the receiver should always follow the server when im ready to serve she should be ready to receive those are the rules
8510491 its going to be good in two days im sure
8510492 its like this tournament it supports me in some kind of way
8510493 i dont know how to explain i just play much more confident im enjoying this city so much the crowd when you play here its a different atmosphere and you just have so much fun being on the court
8510494 i dont think you should be coming into a grand slam and playing first matches with the best game youve got
8510495 i want to grow every match playing better and better today i played much better than my first match so its looking good for me
8510496 i always knew this is what i was going to do
8510497 i never thought id do anything else after my playing career was over
8510498 i knew in my senior year in high school that coaching football is what i wanted to do
8510499 does that change as you go down the way certainly other opportunities come up fortunately this job came up and it was the perfect fit
8510500 after my dad got done playing football he went straight to coaching and he looked like he enjoyed it
8510501 i wanted to enjoy the work that i did and football is something that i really love working with kids is really good and it just seemed natural because everybody in my family is a teacher
8510502 but after two weeks go by and im saying things over and over im just coach aldridge
8510503 this is a first for a lot of us god has given us good direction on how to lead and placed some good coaches and mentors around me were trying to change the approach and mindset of westbury christian football
8510504 the satisfaction for me is being able to teach the game of football to young men
8510505 to watch them evolve in that way and understand the concepts is great and to be around great young men is a breath of fresh air
8510506 its hard for some people to say they really enjoy what they do but i do teaching and coaching football thats my passion i feel like i can do it for 30 years
8510507 thats the best ive felt in four or five months
8510508 im ecstatic to be in the third round and ill work on my game and hopefully it can get better for the next match
8510509 my leg was straight and i couldnt bend it the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain
8510510 as you can see i am completely out of breath
8510511 i was just trying to come back to normal position where i could just stand up and regroup again and play the next point
8510512 we are in the mix and this team has been working to make the playoffs so we are hoping we can make that final push and be in the postseason
8510513 all of these losses on the road have been winnable games
8510514 we have struggled to play well down the stretch and every player on this team is tired of losing on the road i think we are going to be able to turn that around
8510515 all seven teams right now in the western conference have a legitimate shot and a strong chance to work themselves into the race
8510516 its interesting if you see the matchups and how one game even one you arent involved in can impact how you play matchups and tiebreakers could play a big impact in the placement of teams
8510517 making the playoffs is a very doable goal right now and we intend to get there
8510518 when the break came we were playing our best basketball of the season and we just have to pick that right back up
8510519 all we can do is think about basketball and go out there and try win games and extend this season
8510520 one thing i was most proud of as a coach is after the season the defensive guys got together and there was a lot of talk about what we had accomplished on offense
8510521 and they approached it in the right manner from the standpoint they said that if we want to earn any respect on defense weve got to play better and we have to stop somebody
8510522 theyre more comfortable with me im sure and im more comfortable with them
8510523 i still believe deep down in my heart and i know that defense wins championships so thats what we keep on harping on
8510524 we learn to take care of our own business and everything will take care of itself
8510525 r c slocum hired me took a chance on me a long time ago a lot of my philosophy on coaching raising my kids living my life was formulated here while i was at college station whether it was in a staff meeting with r c or meeting with aggies going to the churches going to the schools
8510526 so a lot of who i am as a man forget coaching was formulated here at a amp m ive never forgotten that and now to come back full circle at this point in my life is very unique in many ways but also very gratifying
8510527 first of all hes a great football coach and hes an even better person
8510528 and mike sherman knows texas a amp m he knows the former players he knows the alumni he knows the tradition e slps what the school stands for
8510529 the deal with a amp m it was not college versus the nfl it was a amp m versus any other place i wanted to go someplace i knew i could win
8510530 there are so many unknowns about so many places out there but i knew a amp m what it was about what the heartbeat is here i know the recruiting base i know the high school coaches i know the structure here i felt like without a doubt i could sell in a living room to an 18 year old and his parents
8510531 i just felt like this presented a great opportunity for me to be successful
8510532 he knows whats near and dear to the hearts of texas a amp m aggies
8510533 mike understands the culture and the values we have here hes just terrific i really like this guy
8510534 dan gives us a different kind of ambience a different kind of feel a different kind of humor
8510535 keith is brilliant dan is more of an everyman in his approach if they get into a debate with cris keith might quote a writer from some journal weve never heard of dan would say oh yeah youve got a long neck
8510536 i think it will be a different atmosphere and i think it will be more fun on the set
8510537 we have great facilities and my belief is if youve got the facilities and you can do it why not do it
8510538 so many people have told me youre crazy to do it
8510539 but everythings run pretty smoothly over the last 10 years
8510540 ill venture to say not past 80 im always tempted if somebody really top caliber wants to come and i dont have room to try to make room for them but 80 has to be the tops
8510541 you want to send them a little subliminal message that youre willing to sacrifice for the team
8510542 when they get here for training camp theyll see what im talking about
8510543 if brent barry is playing for a team you know hes playing to win a ring
8510544 hes got one already and im sure hes not trying to take any steps backward im playing with tracy whos desperate to win im desperate to win its just a win win situation
8510545 the ron that rick had in sacramento wed do the trade just for that ron
8510546 if we didnt have such a solid locker room it would be harder to add someone like ron but weve got solid solid veterans
8510547 i dont want it to be the story that ron artest is going to get them over the hump they were already over the hump if we stay healthy we should be ok
8510548 even when youve won a big 12 championship the year before or back to back it means nothing now
8510549 thats the way its been predominantly a lot of the time
8510550 i think they kind of skip over me i like that because its less pressure for me
8510551 we still just havent got the chemistry between he and the crew chief and the team that we rebuilt to be where its at its absolute best but theyre very close to being able to do the deal
8510552 if we could just win a race and get that behind us i think everybody would be a little bit more relaxed
8510553 actions detrimental to stock car racing hitting another competitors car after the race had concluded
8510554 clog our roads shut down commerce violate private property use our school campuses without permission overtax our emergency services cause the elderly undue stress
8510555 their arrogance is amazing theyll even strip down to naked right there in the school parking lot to put their little rubber suits on
8510556 but if they fall over in front of you its your fault if you hit them
8510557 theres a lot anger here its just a matter of time before it spills over ive already seen a couple of cyclists get their noses bloodied for smarting off
8510558 the city makes an effort the county makes no effort
8510559 its just not on their radar screen they cant be bothered
8510560 i dont go into games thinking about the record against the reds but just try to remember what i did to them in games past and how i got different guys out
8510561 i try to stick with a game plan and execute it until they adjust and try to do something else
8510562 i dont think roy cruises or anything but he really showed me what he has on that at bat
8510563 after the last pitch he gave me a little stare and i kind of got goose bumps because i love competition it was awesome even though i lost
8510564 he has almost no fear and has really good stuff and that combination leads to a lot of success i wasnt around for about 21 of those wins of his but he looked liked one of the best pitchers in baseball tonight
8510565 any time you can give your pitchers more than one run to work with it enables them to go out there and pump the zone
8510566 josh is a guy that is tricky a lot of times because hes got several pitches he locates well
8510567 he was tough but with roy on the mound you dont have to get a whole lot it was fortunate we were able to scratch a couple across
8510568 i lost command and threw some pitches over the middle of the plate and got the pitch count up early and started worrying about that until the third inning when they starting swinging on me early in the count
8510569 theres two outs and a runner in scoring position and have to find a way to get them in
8510570 weve had our preseason just like everybody else and theres not much time between now and next week
8510571 weve done a lot of good things but theres a lot of things we need to improve
8510572 our team has improved throughout training camp but we open against a tremendous opponent on the road were going to see where are and every weeks going to be a big time challenge
8510573 the key is that hopefully were healthy coming out of the tampa bay game
8510574 its the expectations bigger than last year its very exciting
8510575 you can pretty much stick in any receiver and the offense will flow
8510576 thats what were basically shooting for its unfinished business the winning record was fine and all and everythings good but we want to win the swac
8510577 jump on that bicycle nobody else wants and ride it next thing somebody else might want it were always looking for ways to set ourselves apart and be trendsetters
8510578 what hes trying to instill in us is that we should expect winning
8510579 im not going to complain about it im going to go out there and do the best i can its a challenge im willing to step up and play and make the most of my opportunities
8510580 i have shown some good things but i also have shown some bad things
8510581 theres no doubt in my mind if i went on i could be a lot better and be a great player but times really not an option
8510582 i really want to be a part of this team
8510583 im not doing it for the money im doing it because i still love the game i love playing football
8510584 holding the olympics was good in terms of china taking a more democratic path we believe this is an irreversible path
8510585 we have to be patient because china will not change so dramatically in a short period of time
8510586 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
8510587 i dont want to go back to the feeling i had before the traffic measures of being stuck in traffic jams every day
8510588 china not only needs economic liberalisation it needs openness in all aspects of society even more
8510589 stolis winner has had two big wins this year and has made more money 789 000 than any previous qualifier in the all american
8510590 we got the call tuesday that g r carter will ride its nice to have the services of the leading rider in the country
8510591 hes always run way better in the finals than his trial and hes won from the inside middle and outside of the track so his post position shouldnt be a problem
8510592 i truly believe the coach establishes the ceiling for a program the higher that ceiling the better chance you have of reaching higher than ever before
8510593 our goal is to be a championship contender each and every year if we do that well win a championship every once in a while i dont think anyone in the acc is going to dominate the conference anymore we have too many good teams in the conference if we can be in that upper echelon and contend for the championship on a regular basis that is what were striving to do
8510594 if you look at wake forest football weve had good teams about every decade
8510595 after the successes in the past weve immediately dropped down to the bottom half of the conference we kind of teased our fans in the past and didnt give them anything on a consistent basis
8510596 when we hired coach briles we made it clear we werent looking to get engaged we were looking to get married
8510597 we made a major commitment to him and he made a major commitment to baylor hes going to have all the support he needs to move this program forward
8510598 you could tell where his vision of the program is going
8510599 we want to show the nation that this is a new team a new baylor a new era
8510600 we can get this program turned around and on the right track
8510601 nobody probably expects us to do anything because were baylor
8510602 were still learning about each other and while were not where we want to be its not bad the most important thing that has come from our practices is that weve come together as a team
8510603 the numbers have been very few it shows that the players understand the importance of what were trying to do here
8510604 were still trying to get a full grasp of the system
8510605 at this point were trying to identify playmakers who can make this offense go
8510606 i think he knows the system well enough to able to go out and excute what we want to do
8510607 theyre flying to the ball we may not be as big as last years defense but this is a group that is well ahead of expectations
8510608 theres not going to be status quo in the swac anymore
8510609 theres a lot of good coaches and great talent here
8510610 once we get our system in place we will be a program to reckon with everyone on this field understands that were on the same page and everyone knows that no one is bigger than the team
8510611 were trying to do as much as we can to help those on our wait list get in the race
8510612 a full refund will hopefully encourage a participant unable to run in january to turn in their registration
8510613 theyre meeting the deadline to get their refund money back from the houston marathon and signing up
8510614 its very hard to get your heart and head together in life in my case theyre not even friendly
8510615 the price good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men
8510616 authoritarianism the soil of racism makes dominant white culture in the united states an easy pawn of fascism
8510617 renders its proletarian benefactors passive and weak ready to coalesce into angry or obedient mobs but unable to pursue the goals of a self actualized citizenry
8510618 if black people or brown for that matter did poorly it was because of bad attitude poor parenting and cultural degeneracy
8510619 the political right continues to support racism and the left ignores it
8510620 american psychiatric association has never officially recognized extreme racism as opposed to ordinary prejudice as a mental health problem although the issue was raised more than 30 years ago
8510621 white people receive unearned and undeserved benefits at the expense of their peers of color
8510622 from the nations beginnings policymakers have been willing to sacrifice even blacks basic entitlements of freedom and justice as a kind of political catalyst that enables whites to reach compromises that resolve differing and potentially damaging economic and political differences
8510623 policymakers recognize and act to remedy racial injustices when and only when they perceive that such action will benefit the nations interests without significantly diminishing whites sense of entitlement
8510624 during the 1940s young white males were not merely invited they were required to participate in the color stratification of their community
8510625 the more he becomes an individual has no choice but to unite himself with the world in the spontaneity of love and productive work or else to seek a kind of security by such ties with the world as destroy his freedom and the integrity of his individual self
8510626 if black people or brown for that matter did poorly it was because of bad attitude poor parenting and cultural degeneracy
8510627 the loss of the self has increased the necessity to conform
8510628 for it results in a profound doubt of ones own identity
8510629 fromm and his colleagues argued that authoritarianism the soil of racism makes dominant white culture in the united states an easy pawn of fascism
8510630 having been poor is no shame but being ashamed of it is
8510631 an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind
8510632 every once in a while ill run my hands over the top of the steering wheel and say wow this guy had a grip
8510633 there was a subversion of the constitution on november 3 and that is what people are protesting against
8510634 we are committed to the supremacy of the constitution and this will continue until the actions of november 3 are reversed
8510635 the dashed ward the end of my booting can i change it to any other word or they r writing this using echo
8510636 there was a subversion of the constitution on november 3 and that is what people are protesting against
8510637 we are committed to the supremacy of the constitution and this will continue until the actions of november 3 are reversed
8510638 this is a startling amount of change in a major area of peoples lives over a very short period
8510639 m gen die aktuellen wirtschaftszahlen nicht gerade zu optimismus einladen so erscheinen die zukunftsperspektiven noch schlimmer
8510640 para ecuador ser a una se al clara de su verdadera voluntad de retomar v nculos el reforzar su presencia en la frontera desgraciadamente
8510641 ha afirmado la diplom tica durante un recorrido con la prensa extranjera por la l nea lim trofe
8510642 colombia cumpla su parte de responsabilidad en ese tema no pueden esperar que s lo las fuerzas armadas la polic a y el gobierno de ecuador est n haciendo el resguardo de lo que le corresponde

8510644 es seguro que se puede hacer dinero en algunos valores financieros particularmente si se tiene paciencia muchos bancos todav a tienen buenas franquicias y s lidos balances
8510645 you better look at what the candidates really stand for
8510646 im a lifelong teddy roosevelt republican and im still a republican
8510647 i have seen so many significant changes in water fowl
8510648 sportsmen have been stereotyped as caring about one issue guns
8510649 normally this time of year we would bring hundreds of people to the hill
8510650 i will be as fiercely supportive of barack as i was for hillary
8510651 i think its safe to say trial lawyers are a little bit like the clintons it is one thing to back another candidate in the beginning but at the end of the day we are very pro the platform that obama is running compared to mccain
8510652 because with sen edwards and sen clinton you have two dynamic and great democrats its a longer process because sen obama is new to the scene
8510653 the trial bar is very pleased with joe biden as a pick because hes always been such a champion for the so called average consumer
8510654 trial lawyers feel very close to biden not only because he voted with us but he advocates and uses our language and understands our importance to the court
8510655 i think trial lawyers are not just about money although that certainly is the place where they get the most exposure
8510656 a lot of our folks get involved in issues at the state level and i think this network has begun to activate its activated much more quickly than it ever did for john kerry or al gore
8510657 thank you for caring so much about what really matters
8510658 health care is not just an issue for me but a passion a cause of my life
8510659 important to move any legislation in the very beginning of a new presidents term we cannot wait
8510660 we are all here to promote health care reform as the top and earliest priority for the next president and congress
8510661 first 100 days of an obama administration were going to finally solve this health care problem
8510662 the american automobile has more health care in it than steel
8510663 our only hope for the future of schip is that sen obama and sen biden are elected to the white house
8510664 if we dont get their vote we will take them on and take them out
8510665 the opposition will be fierce and their pockets will be deep
8510666 quite frankly the republicans have a good political issue on drilling and they happen to be right
8510667 the leadership is always cognizant of the diversity within our own caucus what were trying to do is represent our district and the leadership clearly understands that
8510668 this is realism 101 theres nothing like the american public to bring the leadership around
8510669 we learned in 2002 and 2004 how to micro target reach out to voters and get them to the polls and theres no evidence that the democrats know how to do it as well as we can
8510670 i love the conventions because it fuels the partys energy and builds momentum and brings people together but for me its a lot of work
8510671 although this year with the vice chair role at the dscc its been more so between delegation responsibilities and everything on the schedule the bottom line is its a work process its about building support for the senate democrats its about communicating for the nominee and for the party with the latino community which i play a unique role in and its about doing all the other stuff that you would do at the convention as well
8510672 its time to take new jersey and go from light blue to deep blue
8510673 theres work to be done to solidify the latino community and excite them to come out to vote
8510674 one thing barack obama is blessed with is the ability to communicate
8510675 he does a terrific job encouraging the american people if hes talking one on one with you or if hes talking to a crowd its the same he has the ability to instill hope
8510676 hes not a maverick hes a clone of george bush talk about substance theres no comparison between the two
8510677 hes going to make it clear that theres a choice in this election
8510678 he obviously has to tell his story in a way that connects with people and let them know the distorted statements about him are not true and secondly while i dont think hell be extremely specific on the issues he will make the distinctions between himself and john mccain very clear
8510679 im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
8510680 i dont think theres going to be voters wanting to hear a 10 point plan from anybody what they want to hear is that you have a sense of urgency about saving their lives i dont think you should underrate the power of inspiration
8510681 talk about the change he wants for our countrys future and talk to the american people about what kind of change that would be
8510682 would i be more comfortable with a 20 point lead sure but weve had a 20 point lead before and still havent been successful
8510683 our advice to people was if you have a race be where your constituents are
8510684 if theres a specific reason for them to be there and the primary one might be to meet more people to help with fundraising and if it also helps you lift your profile by coming here
8510685 i understand why republicans are staying home from their convention
8510686 but for me this is the new hampshire primary state and we have an important role to play
8510687 my new hampshire constituents saw me in my district every single day the month of august
8510688 i worked every single day the month of august and they saw me working for them and now im working for new hampshires role as the primary state
8510689 the other thing too is all the eyes of the country right now are on the convention so by being here at the convention i think she will actually be able to generate more publicity and free media than if she was back at home
8510690 also its a good opportunity to do some additional fundraising which is always important of course
8510691 this is her opportunity to make new contacts to build support for her campaign and to be able to develop the financial depth that she needs to have to stay truly competitive
8510692 there were some gawkers but it wasnt anything i havent seen before
8510693 ladies and gentlemen i present to you the shortest film in motion picture history
8510694 its just an incredible exhibit aside from the message even
8510695 its just interesting how this iconic art has become so important to the campaign
8510696 some of the pictures speak to change some of the pictures speak back to history and the changes that have been made in the past
8510697 the distortion of our laws and the deterioration of our country
8510698 i dont want to make this a black thing it doesnt fit there and well lose if we do that
8510699 doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the 5 bills
8510700 i dont think were nominating a cbcer i think were nominating a capable competent qualified person who just happens to be from chicago who just happens to be a member of the united states senate and just happens to be a member of the congressional black caucus
8510701 but i didnt come here to nominate a cbcer i came to nominate a capable competent and qualified candidate who just happens to have some other qualities that i have something in common with
8510702 its our turn now message which is divisive and polarizing
8510703 theyre obviously excited you can see it in their faces
8510704 but they are also nervous no one in this party thinks this thing is in the bag
8510705 i talk about what it means to me as a 68 year old african american who spent a lot of time in pursuit of the american dream
8510706 to come to this point and see this party my party which has been accused by the media of always taking african americans for granted about to give an african american the highest the biggest greatest prize this party has to be in a position to be the no 1 leader in the free world that is important to me
8510707 race is obviously a problem for us in this country we know that
8510708 i dont fret over those things you recognize theyre real but you keep going
8510709 the drafting of these things is like giving birth to sextuplets
8510710 this legislation is on the floor because people are killing themselves by smoking these evil cigarettes
8510711 and the distinguished gentleman the minority leader is going to be among the next to die
8510712 ive been trying to warn everybody theres going to be a huge cost increase and ive gotten a rich flow of denunciation for that
8510713 lets be honest cap and trade is going to result in a very significant increase in energy prices
8510714 hes been at the highest levels of the federal government in the legislative branch as well as the executive branch
8510715 my guess is that he feels he can do as much or more outside of government today and i think that might be true
8510716 hes done a remarkable job in making this much more of an issue people are much more comfortable talking about
8510717 i think youre going to see him stay very vocal and visible and i dont think he needs to be in government to do that
8510718 its hard to see him take on a cabinet post
8510719 mr gore has taken off the table any formal role in an obama administration
8510720 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i would consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration and i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain why i dont think its the best idea
8510721 the best use of my talents and experience is to expand the political space in which these members and politicians address the climate crisis
8510722 whatever i can to make sure he is elected president
8510723 sen obama strongly agrees with vice president gore and looks forward to working together with him throughout this campaign and as president
8510724 ive learned you dont mess around with that stuff until after you win
8510725 we really felt like it was more important to be in the district
8510726 the fact of the matter is the more dollars that are out there that can get the message out it has to have an effect
8510727 i see the visible effect of what theyre doing in different races across the state and while theres a part of me that would like to coordinate everything thats going on i cant do that in this state so im appreciative of the fact that theyre like this other entity out there that is helping us get a message out
8510728 having additional resources to get the message out where typically in colorado democrats have always been underfunded outspent 2 1 we can now go toe to toe dollar for dollar and that makes a big difference
8510729 if you liked the last six or seven years of the bush policies youre going to love the republican candidate
8510730 i dont think mccain being on the ticket is going to have much effect
8510731 most of the people thought wed circle the wagons having to defend our territory
8510732 well things keep rolling in our direction but its very very hard to get 60 votes
8510733 it is more likely than not however that we will pick up a significant majority of seats and if we get to 57 or 58 or 59 well be able on key issues to pick up a few votes to overcome the republican filibuster
8510734 we were blessed that they stepped up to the plate and decided to run
8510735 as the udall from the south our slogan is to vote for the udall nearest you
8510736 the reality is that were ahead now and we expect to be ahead when the absentee votes are in
8510737 what i think weve done is a very successful job at making alaskans understand that im good at what i do and im successful at what i do
8510738 after a long night of narrow margins and back and forth leads the republican race for congress is quite simply still too close to call
8510739 it is in everybodys best interest to get this resolved quickly
8510740 as we anxiously but patiently await the final count we remain confident that once all the votes are counted i will prevail in this race
8510741 i think that goes back to his days as a reporter uncovering the truth and trying to hold politicians accountable and many of his candidates have been those kinds of candidates
8510742 in those early days the firm was trying to get its footing and we took on a lot of tough races which we won
8510743 i think he really just as he took on obama at the time he got in the 2004 senate race they thought he was going to flame out they certainly didnt think he was going to be the nominee
8510744 that may be why he and obama are good mates in this journey because both are willing to take on tough races
8510745 the congresswoman who won dan quayles old seat in an upset that caused the republican national chairman to say he was ashamed
8510746 wherever youre located whatever the odds we can help you write history whether youre the favorite or the underdog
8510747 we assigned to him the sins of his bosses and thats really how we were able to define him
8510748 you had a very seasoned candidate who frankly took a page out of our book ran an attack campaign started out very early very aggressive
8510749 she ran a campaign that i would be proud of
8510750 i believe the most important place for me to be in the last week of august is overseas with our troops
8510751 traveling to iraq and afghanistan will not only give me a first hand view of the situation on the ground but also a chance to visit with and thank our men and women who are so bravely and honorably serving our country
8510752 he had the option to go now and it was his priority
8510753 what these guys are doing is showing they are out there monitoring the situation and keeping up with whats happening on the ground
8510754 maybe when joe donnelly and don cazayoux return from iraq they will finally have the courage to speak up against the chorus of democrats in denver who stand opposed to gen david petraeus successful change in strategy in iraq until they do so they might as well be cheering on nancy pelosi hillary clinton barack obama and the thousands of left wing activists at the convention
8510755 the trip will help me in my position on the veterans affairs committee as i will have a broader understanding of the challenges that returning veterans face
8510756 everybody understands the historical significance of this event its not lost on the secret service its not lost on the agencies we work with
8510757 the thing is its not an uncommon type of event for the secret service
8510758 the fact that that theres going to be 75 000 people will be interesting
8510759 understanding the historical event and the amount of people who will be here it would be wise and prudent to arrive early
8510760 hes truly the man of the century for our state the last century and the current century
8510761 we dont talk about that if something changes someone will step to the forefront
8510762 is more of a media and national concern than it ever has been for the state
8510763 people dont want their names mentioned theyd dive under the table if they knew their names were being put out there
8510764 while physically byrd has some problems his mind is still extremely strong
8510765 today there is a big demand because of all of the people that want to see sen clinton speak
8510766 in my interview i told him i was honored because im probably the only guy who has worked with every candidate that was against him
8510767 its nice to reconnect with the democratic family of state legislators and governors
8510768 because chairman dean has a box he wants to be helpful
8510769 credentials here are very different from congress if you dont have a credential you cant go even a member of congress has to do a lot of fast talking to get through
8510770 many of you feel a responsibility to represent the voters in your state others want a chance to vote whats in your heart
8510771 with the goal of victory with faith in our party lets declare together with one lone voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8510772 i guess there is somebody who will be working us to try to get us to change our votes
8510773 but a lot of other people signing your ballots have made a different choice
8510774 the vice president shot someone in the face in texas
8510775 we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time
8510776 but let me tell you the hurt that some of us feel today would be so much worse if john mccain was president of the united states
8510777 barack was a young man wet behind the ears and he didnt understand retail politics
8510778 he was very articulate and was a tough campaigner abreast on some of the issues but he had no record
8510779 i had a history of working on behalf of my constituents in my community
8510780 the lord decided that i was doing a good job
8510781 he took the loss very seriously and the it taught him a little bit about humility
8510782 and i believe that it serves him well now having a humble spirit
8510783 when you are as self assured and as confident as barack a loss of that magnitude was shocking to his ego
8510784 im so proud of him in who he has become the type of politician that he has become the type of person that he has become i think that barack now is the best thing for america
8510785 he will really have a problem in the congress and thats what im afraid of
8510786 his major obstacle would be getting his legislation passed and not just in the senate but in the house
8510787 its just an incredible exhibit aside from the message even
8510788 its just interesting how this iconic art has become so important to the campaign
8510789 some of the pictures speak to change some of the pictures speak back to history and the changes that have been made in the past
8510790 the distortion of our laws and the deterioration of our country
8510791 dalam bap ismoyo diperiksa berkaitan dengan pasal 170 dan 351 kuhp sedangkan saya didakwa pasal 170 junto 55 dan 156 kuhp ini tidak ada korelasinya kedua saksi juga mengaku tidak mengenal saya dan tidak pernah mengikuti dakwah saya
8510792 saya merasa dirugikan dan bila saksi yang dihadirkan tidak berhubungan dengan dirinya hanya membuang buang waktu saja
8510793 jadi saudara lebih senang jika jaksa penuntut umum menghadirkan saksi saksi yang berkaitan dengan perbuatan saudara
8510794 ini bukan permasalahan senang atau tidak senang saya hanya ingin pengadilan ini menghadirkan saksi sesuai dengan dakwaan
8510795 itupun jika memenuhi syarat syarat tertentu hal ini tidak sesuai dengan keppres no 18 tahun 2000

8510806 then there was a contest that was decided by the kupuna the elders in the molokai community chose which is the best video to educate their population
8510807 about two thirds of the children and adolescents here have type 2 diabetes as opposed to type 1 diabetes
8510808 but you can imagine what that means for someone whos 15 years old and may be on the same time path as that adult who developed it at 50 or 60
8510809 we see that among the pacific islanders one hundred percent of the children that have diabetes are obese and approximately 70 percent of the asian and the asian pacific islander mixed children are also obese
8510810 another factor that contributes is the lack of physical activity we are becoming very sendentary so its another area where we really need to work on
8510811 we just switched over to under armour this year and its been big news
8510812 i think coach greg mcmackin did a great job in the off season reaching out to the fans
8510813 i think as we go into this season they not only know that hes a fantastic coach but a wonderful person that really cares about hawaii
8510814 we have about 30 000 tickets already sold for the weber state game and were just in our third day of selling season tickets to the students and weve already sold 700 added mcnamara
8510815 the team entrance to the field has totally been revamped and i think everyone is going to be pleasantly surprised
8510816 i cant wait for this weekend even though well be down here at 4 30
8510817 theyre tired theyre cold theyre hypodermic but they seem to be pretty aware of whats going on and our communications with them have been pretty good so far
8510818 were going to have to hope they have good weather use their sleeping bag and tough it out through the nigh so we can get our personnel up there
8510819 theres no reason i cant be the change i want to see in the world
8510820 when it rains their drinking water looks like chocolate milk
8510821 this isnt nuclear science here we can clean up dirty water
8510822 people would walk two or three hours to come knock on my door
8510823 at that point they make me stand up and give a speech which i wasnt ready for
8510824 this is a very hard decision for me to make as i feel that i could possibly play one more year but out of respect i would only do that if i felt 100 percent
8510825 i am going to miss playing for the club greatly
8510826 i am truly honored to have spent six wonderful years here there are not enough words to express my gratitude to the club
8510827 his life was a lifetime of service to cricket and his legacy is that cricket continues to grow stronger soccer has pele cricket has bradman no name in cricket conjures up such widespread awe and respect as that of sir donald bradman
8510828 that name says all that is best about the game and it is synonymous with cricket
8510829 even now 60 years after his final test match and with time to put his achievements into context his batting average of 99 94 still seems scarcely believable especially when one compares it to those of the many other players to have graced the game at the highest level
8510830 as a captain too he looked to lead as he played in a positive manner and his 1948 side including the likes of keith miller neil harvey arthur morris and ray lindwall is rightly remembered as one of the greatest line ups of all time
8510831 i am delighted australia is leading the tributes to sir donald with its captain ricky ponting delivering the bradman oration in sydney
8510832 theres no change in the tour itinerary bangalore is to host the opening test from october 9 13 after the australians start the tour with a four day warm up tie against a select india xi at hyderabad from october 2 5
8510833 as a youngster all i wanted was to play for sri lanka
8510834 i remember when i got my first call up for the national team it was a one dayer against india in rajkot i had just turned 20 and arjuna ranatunga gave me the new ball ahead of the others navjot sidhu was my first wicket and that was after he had blasted a hundred
8510835 there have been a few good performances along the way but winning the world cup remains the greatest memory
8510836 there were a lot of guys more talented than me my game was limited but i worked harder
8510837 nothing comes easy to you youve got to make most of your talent i work hard on my game
8510838 wasim was a very clever bowler he was lethal and more often than not outsmarted the batsmen waqar was entirely different the two of them together made life miserable for batsmen soon murali will go past wasims record as the highest wicket taker in odis
8510839 he has limited abilities but he has made the most of it over time with slower deliveries bowling different angles taking the pace off the ball he is an intelligent bowler
8510840 all the years of hard work you put in are for moments like this its hard to explain in words how you feel im getting goose bumps watching vaas get to 400 so you can imagine what it must have felt like when i crossed the milestone
8510841 vaasys is a huge contribution especially in the sub continent it is not an easy task to go on for so long and be consistent
8510842 he and murali have done the job for us for quite some time now they have been great role models hats off to vaasy for going on for so long 400 is a great milestone for anybody
8510843 there are some more people getting involved and we will forward the details once they join
8510844 i was roped in as the head of cricket as i was under the impression that they wanted mumbai ideas but i was asked to do managerial job
8510845 we were all supposed to be with hyderabad team for three years but there was as clause that allowed us to be removed with a notice none of us took it seriously perhaps the owners felt that by changing the support staff they could solve the problems
8510846 there will be some changes in the player set up as we want better results
8510847 in four month old babies we demonstrate very early specialisation and indeed an adult like pattern of activation of the brain regions that process face to face social interaction
8510848 we are not claiming it could diagnose autism merely that it may prove a useful early warning signal
8510849 as parents are feeling the economic slow down we are urging mums and dads to continue to top up their child trust funds and other childrens savings accounts
8510850 in recent years we have seen a real positive shift in the nations savings habits and it will be a travesty for future generations should parents cut down on saving for their childrens future in this difficult economic climate
8510851 the demand for these tanks wasnt just about the gas but mostly because these are iron tanks a metal that can be easily used in the manufacturing or weaponry rocket and mortar shells
8510852 the tanks were in a huge warehouse that is not suited for gas storage it was filled with wooden platforms and had no fire extinguishing system in place it posed a very grave threat to local residents
8510853 the demand for these tanks wasnt just about the gas but mostly because these are iron tanks a metal that can be easily used in the manufacturing or weaponry rocket and mortar shells
8510854 the committee does not see any logical reason as to why a medical center should be created there

8510864 i was very moved by sen edward kennedy and by his effort to come here and by his remarks it was a powerful thing to do and a class act hes quite a guy
8510865 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8510866 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8510867 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8510868 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8510869 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8510870 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8510871 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8510872 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8510873 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country

8510889 we have worshiped food and elevated it to a place of unprecedented power in our lives our hearts have been devoted to figuring out what the latest fad diet will or will not let us eat
8510890 behind poor health behaviors we often find social injustice and inadequate social services and insufficient economic opportunities school and church lunches and refreshments may feature food with low nutritional value and contribute further to the problems with diet and obesity in our state the well known association of poverty health and education does not spring from the spirit of our people but from a culture for which we are all responsible
8510891 it would be terrific if a program like this got off the ground
8510892 theres a danger of narcissism in these other groups why is the concern always about me and my body and my self discipline rather than saying that other people in the developing world or in rural parts of our own country are in dire straits and need help learning about food and need help affording healthy food to eat a balanced diet

8510896 it was a good toss to win there was something in the wicket for the spinners and they got a lot of turn even the pacers did well
8510897 all the members of the team backed each other and took up responsibility when it was required and this actually helped the team
8510898 suresh batted beautifully we were having a good partnership but we got out at crucial moments and did not score as much as we would have wanted in the last 10 overs i think we should have scored at least 25 runs more
8510899 the toss proved crucial it put the indians in an advantageous position but i should say we made too many mistake along the way there was lack of consistent partnership from the batters and that did not help the team at all
8510900 we hope to put up a good show in the next match we need to avoid committing these silly mistakes
8510901 i had to be consistent and try to get a high percentage of my first serves in
8510902 i didnt return so well and i had a lot of ups and downs and big frustrations
8510903 but it is the first match it is always the trickiest one but hopefully the next one will be better
8510904 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8510905 but in a certain moment i felt big pain so i had to get it taped
8510906 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8510907 i was concerned i was going to get my dress dirty
8510908 the most important thing is to stay positive in the difficult moments in the match even when you feel tired
8510909 when i got into a dangerous situation i started moving her around a little bit more in the second set i was able to gain more confidence

8510942 the cloud forcing however gives for the above sensitivity 0 3 0 5 c and has therefore the potential of explaining nearly all of the temperature changes in the period studied
8510943 the windiest sites have not been built because there is no way to move that electricity from there to the load centers
8510944 if you want to do it on a national scale where the transmission line distances will be much longer and utility regulations are different congress must act
8510945 permanent destruction of hundreds of thousands of acres of pristine public lands
8510946 this just shows the true objective of green activism environmentalists dont actually want us to find alternative ways of producing energy they want us to stop using energy altogether
8510947 the basic premise of environmentalism is to leave nature alone capturing and utilizing any source of energy even ones that are supposedly green and renewable will necessarily have some impact on nature and will therefore inevitably be subject to environmentalist attacks and condemnation
8510948 since the use of energy is an indispensable component of everything we do in our lives the greens opposition to even such ridiculous impractical sources of energy as solar and wind reveals their basic animus against human life
8510949 an exasperated arnold schwarzenegger said if we cannot put solar power plants in the mojave desert i dont know where the hell we can put it but that is the whole point on green philosophy there is literally no place on earth for mankind
8510950 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8510951 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8510952 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8510953 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8510954 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8510955 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8510956 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8510957 the government is busy basking in the benefits of this policy while leaving the environment to pick up the tab
8510958 been astute enough to pick up what might be a current hole in the resource efficiency capability of not only victoria but also the nation
8510959 encouragement to deal with a whole of life issue concerning products that may ultimately end up within the waste stream
8510960 i am happy to look at local based regulation and market mechanisms but also harmonisation with other jurisdictions across the nation to try to make sure we have the appropriate investment and regulatory environment whether that be most appropriate in state or national jurisdictions
8510961 clearly more focused on collecting accolades than the environmental issues associated with their policy
8510962 in the next decade victoria will be faced with tens of thousands of dead hybrid car batteries with no environmentally sustainable way of disposing of them
8510963 i want victoria to lead the way nationally in developing a clear framework for identifying when and what products require recycling at the end of their use including car batteries and the most appropriate market or regulatory approach to achieve that
8510964 specialises in the recovery of nickel and cadmium to a strict environmental standard
8510965 the judgment was it was a good opportunity to visit australia and to discuss what is being considered in terms of the future policy arrangements applying to the industry and the perspective of a key participant
8510966 the belief that we can go further and eliminate coal from our energy supply is a dangerous delusion
8510967 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
8510968 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
8510969 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
8510970 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
8510971 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
8510972 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

8510979 the review will include consideration of hupds diversity training community outreach and recruitment efforts as well as the ways in which harvards past experience as well as best practices elsewhere can help inform our future practice
8510980 all we could hear in the initial few minutes was some women screaming and people running helter skelter a part of the unit was engulfed by the blaze and heavy smoke
8510981 we removed at least six victims who had shut themselves inside a bathroom
8510982 all these victims appeared to be in a state of unconsciousness owing to suffocation
8510983 what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
8510984 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
8510985 use social networks like facebook flickr youtube twitter and friendfeed to share information with friends and family despite their familiarity with these platforms 81 survey respondents did not believe these types of platforms could hurt their businesses
8510986 while the web hosting industry does not view social networks as a threat to its business people are going to functional hosts for services that allow them to share information online
8510987 this demonstrates that there are opportunities for web hosts to tap into consumers who embrace social networks but these opportunities are being overlooked by the very industry that knows the internet best its important that as the web hosting industry moves forward we understand that internet users are seeking a customized personalized internet experience for both personal and professional reasons ultimately its about customer relationships providers and resellers need to work together to provide the support services and infrastructure that give users the best experience

8510999 he should have had the courage and the guts to kill himself before killing anyone else
8511000 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work

8511004 possibly now well have to be dragged through a court proceeding in california if they go ahead with the prosecution it would be such as waste of taxpayer money because hell never spend a day in a california prison
8511005 generally for human beings its pretty hard to maintain impartiality when confronted with such horror
8511006 it was a good toss to win there was something in the wicket for the spinners and they got a lot of turn even the pacers did well
8511007 all the member of the team backed each other and took up responsibility when it was required and this actually helped the team
8511008 the toss proved crucial it put the indians in an advantageous position but i should say we made too many mistake along the way there was lack of consistent partnership from the batters and that did not help the team at all
8511009 we hope to put up a good show in the next match we need to avoid committing these silly mistakes
8511010 its always a pleasure for me to come on your program gordon and congratulations on your continued success and adherence to the principles and philosophies that keep our nation great

8511022 the highly personal relationships that are sheltered by this constitutional guaranty are exemplified by those that attend the creation and sustenance of a family marriage
8511023 it is true of course that as an historical matter in this state marriage always has been limited to a union between a man and a woman hence the foregoing thirteen pages of supposed evidence are entirely irrelevant tradition alone however generally has not been viewed as a sufficient justification for perpetuating without examination the restriction or denial of a fundamental constitutional right
8511024 we need not decide in this case whether the name marriage is invariably a core element of the state constitutional right to marry so that the state would violate a couples constitutional right even if perhaps in order to emphasize and clarify that this civil institution is distinct from the religious institution of marriage the state were to assign a name other than marriage as the official designation of the formal family relationship for all couples

8511214 military extremists present an elevated threat to both their fellow service members and the public
8511215 we witnessed with timothy mcveigh that todays racist extremist may become tomorrows domestic terrorist
8511216 sensitive and reliable source reporting indicates supremacist leaders are encouraging followers who lack documented histories of neo nazi activity and overt racist insignia such as tattoos to infiltrate the military as ghost skins in order to recruit and receive training for the benefit of the extremist movement
8511217 looking ahead current and former military personnel belonging to white supremacist extremist organizations who experience frustration at the inability of these organizations to achieve their goals may choose to found new more operationally minded and operationally capable groups
8511218 the military training veterans bring to the movement and their potential to pass this training on to others can increase the ability of lone offenders to carry out violence from the movements fringes

8511221 there are actually a lot more skinheads nazis white supremacists now in the military than there has been in a long time
8511222 us racists are actually getting into the military a lot now because if we dont every one who already is in the military will take pity on killing sand niggers yes i have killed women yes i have killed children and yes i have killed older people but the biggest reason im so proud of my kills is because by killing a brown many white people will live to see a new dawn
8511223 the military is to some extent desperate to get people to fight soldiers who are not fit mentally and physically sick but they continue to send them
8511224 the new nazi army how the u s military is allowing the far right to join its ranks

8511294 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8511295 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8511296 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8511297 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8511298 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8511299 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people

8511309 het verhaal van de travers begon op 21 juli 1978 we hadden zelfs de belgische driekleur gehesen een paar maanden geleden belde kevin mulligan mij met de vraag of we dit niet moesten vieren hij stelde voor om een duo te vormen met philip catherine op die manier kon hij nog eens zijn eigen repertoire bovenhalen philip was onmiddellijk gewonnen voor het idee want de twee kennen elkaar al van sinds hun tijd op berklee het wordt dus een unieke avond want catherine speelt hier in dienst van iemand anders
8511310 bernard kwam als jonge gast nog enkele keren in de travers en is nu vaste klant van brassages de succesrijke en vooral heel gezellige zondagnamiddagconcerten die imberechts sinds een jaar organiseert in dongelberg waals brabant gtb hij wilde ook zijn steentje bijdragen aan de viering toen hij hoorde dat charles loos indertijd al een compositie ter ere van de travers geschreven had wilde hij dat idee verder uitwerken charles een ancien van de club maakte nieuwe arrangementen voor twee andere reeds bestaande erenummers en voegde er extra materiaal aan toe ook bernard componeerde speciaal iets voor deze gelegenheid ze worden begeleid door onder anderen st phane mercier en jean paul esti venart
8511311 fred speelde steeds op zon manier dat het leek alsof je in een grote concertzaal zat de dag dat onze beruchte witte piano geplaatst werd was ook de stemmer van de firma aanwezig net die avond concerteerde fred en zoals altijd ging hij enorm zwierig en volumineus tekeer de man hield zijn hart vast en dacht dat de piano totaal ontregeld zou zijn na het optreden toch niet het was gewoon fred die zo een impressie kon geven zonder het instrument toe te takelen
8511312 ik leerde hem zowat twintig jaar geleden kennen samen met zijn groep was hij hier in brussel beland per mobilhome heel rock n roll allemaal vooral ook omdat het repertoire een fusie was van jazz en rock we hielden al die jaren contact en ook hij stelde voor om iets speciaals te doen rond dertig jaar travers dat wordt het zeker want hij brengt een programma waar ook traditionele zwitserse folkinstrumenten aan te pas komen

8511320 pregnancy is already considered an aggravating factor we ask the canadian government to recognize that we are coping with two losses two deaths

8511340 maliki said that the united states and iraq had agreed that all foreign troops would be off iraqi soil by the end of 2011
8511341 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
8511342 followed an ancient code of sadism and murder inspired by a dark being whose name was never spoken
8511343 my guess is that chameleon boy dream girl and element lad are up to something probably something involving the legion espionage squad because johns is definitely not going to leave the espionage squad out of the action look for them to pop up with some vital information secret weapon awesomeness around issue 4
8511344 did anyone else notice that all of a sudden this legion is using threeboot legions logo
8511345 it looks like the armor that superman used in krisis of the krimson kriptonite in action comics 659
8511346 theres a touch of gray in zods hair if you look close i guess hes gotten out a few times and screwed around
8511347 brandes death is an interesting parallel to the legions origin story
8511348 these are representative of the members theyre not all the members who are coming through because some of them are dead and some of them have changed like in the zero hour legion monstress died awhile ago thunder returned to her own time so there will be characters that dont appear in this story because their characters dont currently exist we pick up the zero hour legion right where we left them off and in the three boot legion dream girl died and cosmic boys missing and their mon el is back in the phantom zone so well be up to date with everything as it is right now like in the zero hour legion lightning lad actually has the body of element lad
8511349 after receiving information gathered out of interrogation we have arrested two people namely tanveer and zahir these two were responsible for making arrangements like looking after and guiding those who came from outside to carry out bomb blasts they were also involved in identifying places to implant bombs
8511350 at our studio and allied outlets we have over a lakh of ganeha idols they are from one inch tiny idols to 60 feet high ganesha our responsibility lies till we hand over the idol to the customer after which he has to safely ferry it home
8511351 we have 300 to 400 designs for the customers to choose we have theme based idols too like the ones in the past when we had one on kargil conflict last year there was one idol of fatima baby the child from pakistan who underwent a complicated heart surgery here in bangalore this year there is the theme on firing on farmers who were agitating over the supply of fertilisers
8511352 we have been catering to the needs of buyer devotees from the usa and uk and europe we send the idols from here to mangalore port from where the idols are shipped the idols for foreign buyers may range from six inches to seven feet at the most the tiny idols are sold for rupees 60 to 70 an agent buys them in bulk nearly three months ahead of the festival and ships them
8511353 its a very exciting find because you rarely come across the bones in their original skeletal shape
8511354 we have found vertebrae ribs and a thigh bone of a very big adult dinosaur from the early cretaceous period
8511355 its also enormous we first found a femur thigh bone 1 80m long articulated with the hip then bigger and bigger ribs up to 2 40m
8511356 those from the early cretaceous period are much less common and one of this size is vary rare so we are able to advance our knowledge of the group in this period
8511357 we want to situate this dinosaur in the context of sauropod dinosaurs we have considerable hope that it may be a new species linked to the brachiosaurus and for which wed have to find a new name
8511358 this is our dream project our plan is not to build just a shopping mall but a landmark destination for both residents and tourists alike the facilities brands services architecture and amenities will be comparable to the best in the world

8511360 they are present not only in the uk but also in the states also in latin america and now are moving onto asia
8511361 so you have these large banks sort of balancing their risks in one part of the world and in another
8511362 anything that the bank invests in has to be on the same balance sheet
8511363 so far because of their business mix which is retail because of the tight regulation they are better placed than other banks in europe mr garcia says
8511364 the problem is that the economy is in a very bad situation and i think its going to be a long process of downturn
8511365 if you dont fully understand an instrument dont buy it if you would not buy a specific product for yourself dont try to sell it
8511366 if you do not know your customers very well dont lend them any money if you do these three things you will be a better banker my son
8511367 after the project is completed the concerned bank national horticulture board along with the team of the cultivator will inspect the work after that the board grants 20 per cent subsidy after this the state governments work begins after inspecting the work we provide 20 per cent matching grant to the cultivator in this way a cultivator gets 40 per cent redemption in the total cost borne
8511368 we benefit a lot from this scheme most of the time we were not reaping much profit but because of governments subsidized rates we have benefited a lot and are reaping profits even from the flowers
8511369 if i were pinocchio my nose would have reached cold storage hot and sour soup good stuff for a cold wintery day like yesterday gosh there was enough rain to wash the entire government clean so glancing at the other couple what are you guys up to tonight oh just a quiet night possibly mambo jambo

8511375 this is a case where everyone was so enamored and felt so much sympathy for the holocaust survivor it just overwhelmed everyone in the case including the jury

8511398 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8511399 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the north pole area right now is covered with very thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8511400 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8511401 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the arctic ocean in summer by 2030 or so

8511414 officer kokotek is an experienced officer who maintains a calm professional manner when dealing with both the public and his peers
8511415 my idea was lets put some faces and names on these decisions and what the police administration is doing in the background
8511416 i was trying to bring attention to the problems going on in the department
8511417 i would see these decisions and this would be my response to it either you get mad or you laugh at it and do a little satire
8511418 harmons eyes could shift and his ears puff out those are things people noticed about him
8511419 i do draw i do work with photos and do arts things that was my way of expressing myself
8511420 i thought i had a first amendment right to speak out on a site where i stayed anonymous
8511421 creating or posting cartoons drawings or caricatures which denigrate or make light of any individual or group based on race gender sexual orientation
8511422 i cant have police officers in the department doing things like that that show an aversion to any group or sexual orientation or race or anything
8511423 i think there was a lot of undertone in all of the pictures
8511424 if he were a private citizen id protect his right all day long
8511425 but he wasnt he was a city employee and they are held to a different standard
8511426 i was trying to use satire to lampoon issues on the st pete police department if im putting up a picture of someone acting like a witch shes probably acting like a witch
8511427 even in the academy kokotek was drawing pictures of all of us this isnt something new
8511428 we used to joke a lot at the department these were psychological ways for us to deal with high stress situations we laughed at ourselves thats what kept our sanity
8511429 if we dont have people like picasso or other people who are chastising the department and making people accountable for their decisions there will never be any changes and staff will be able to run amok
8511430 to me its a warning to everyone else out there dont criticize or well do the same thing to you as kokotek
8511431 we cant do our work without the help of the students
8511432 an investigation into the fire which is believed to have been started deliberately and the whereabouts of the owners has been launched

8511434 i think the convention has gone pretty well so far what do you think
8511435 my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8511436 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8511437 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8511438 reminded us of what its like when you actually put people first
8511439 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8511440 i like the thought of being a man whos sexually adventurous i havent played a character like this before im not going to pretend dil kabaddi is a film strictly for adults and we shouldnt shy away from saying this
8511441 its about dishonesty in man woman relationships i call it dishonesty by the standards set by civil society sometimes you are not satisfied in one relationship and keep looking for sexual and emotional satisfaction elsewhere i like playing this promiscuous character
8511442 in fact i pride myself for being quite fit but playing a gold medallist marathon runner isnt same thing ive to get into better shape and ive to look convincing as a long distance runner
8511443 i enjoy working so much but i need time for myself and roles like this one for tigmanshus film where i play a real life character require concentrated preparation so im taking time off from august onwards
8511444 i shot with tabu and natalie portman for mira nairs film and now im shooting with soha ali khan in dil kabaddi and in billo barber
8511445 so im lately surrounded by beautiful women the thing about beauty is you cant have too much of it
8511446 after these two films ill really have to stop to catch my breath
8511447 i love that song and i adore imran khan i think hes going to be a huge star he and ranbir are my current favourites in fact i told ranbir how much i like imran no he didnt mind at all ranbir and i are friends after bachna ae haseeno
8511448 some people you gel with others you just do your job with katrina is one of those cases we were just professionals on the sets but there was no rivalry or anything
8511449 we were both working for the same film not at cross purposes we were both liked in race though people would like to believe otherwise there was no negativity or animosity between us there was no dramatic tension on the sets were both too sensible for that there was just no scope for one to one interaction
8511450 id love to complete the film right now im going through a phase when im searching for roles ive no idea what i want but yes id like to do an author backed zany fun filled film at the same time i love multi starrers theyre more fun on the sets
8511451 lots of unfulfilled wishes before i give up acting if i dont like whats being offered i wont sign anything for now my last film is freeze with neil nitin mukesh
8511452 shes really sweet johns brother and anka were seeing each other for three years beyond that i wouldnt like to say anything about them let them lead their own lives
8511453 beyond buying a ticket im doing nothing to promote the film thats a very good way to pitch in

8511463 i go with the critics and the peoples verdict which said the movie was not a good one i admit that maan gaye was a bad movie
8511464 im not that kind of a person who will go on telling anything good because im involved in it even if it is my performance in a film i dont have any reservation in telling the truth
8511465 i cant tell what went wrong with the movie or who is responsible for it but it is for sure the end result of the movie was not good
8511466 i play a very small role in the movie which is of not much importance even if you take my role out of the movie it will not have an impact on the film my character in the film is what a comedian does i provide the comic elements
8511467 though the story is very good but i request my audience not to expect anything from this film as my role is very small and i have nothing much to do
8511468 i play the lead role in before the rains which has already done a business of around 2 million dollars in the us canada and england
8511469 what youve heard is absolutely right this is unprecedented and overwhelming ive never gone through this experience before throughout my performance at the 02 arena the audience didnt sit at all all 20 000 of them stood on their feet while i performed
8511470 it was a deeply moving and humbling experience ive never been in a performance like this ever and perhaps the audience too had never felt like this before the entire venue was sold out we all got standing ovations the audience just freaked out
8511471 lets admit it the crowds came in such huge numbers mainly to see the big b we were the side attractions the way the audiences everywhere reacted to him had to be seen to be believed

8511521 amtrak were one of several delivery firms that dabs com uses and we have plans in place to ensure that customers will not be adversely affected by what has happened
8511522 those orders that were due to go out with amtrak this week will now be delivered by business post and customers will receive their products in the next few days
8511523 the first one was definitely unexpected and a bit of shock
8511524 in 03 i think it all came a bit too soon when we came out of the end of the year and we had won a championship i dont think we knew what wed actually achieved and now knowing what goes into it and the rewards that go to the guys and everybody who helps thats the biggest part of it
8511525 if we do win a championship it would mean a ton more than 03 i think
8511526 the drought seasons in 04 and 05 definitely make you respect things a lot more feel gifted in that you have the opportunity
8511527 so anytime you even win a race you thrive on it a little more
8511528 i think you definitely get recognized a lot more especially in indy which is where i live
8511529 theres such a history there and people love that race and i probably get a little more respect too
8511530 i think if helio wins the next two races we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that
8511531 we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
8511532 i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
8511533 we just need to keep doing what weve been doing all year and well be fine
8511534 in terms of this season i think everything that hes done and weve had success together in the past is the result of all of those years of working hard day by day
8511535 its not something that just fell into place its his experience level all the things that hes managed to gather up in his data bank of experience is paying large dividends
8511536 with his ability to adapt his driving style to the racetracks that we have today in this series hes at the right place at the right time with the right team i think we were on the edge of it last year and i think his experience the whole last year was just at the point where it was starting to work well but this year scotts really been able to capitalize on that
8511537 its the same people and theyre obviously doing the same things that they were and maybe its a combination of all the small things have probably come through a little better
8511538 last year we were decent i think we just werent aggressive enough in the first part of the season and thats where we lost a lot of it and had to try and pull it back with six races to go
8511539 i think this season we started strong any season you win a indy 500 definitely gives you a lot of confidence and a lot of motivation for the rest of the year but i also think everybodys just been nailing it the engineering has been extremely good the pit stops have been fantastic where we have struggled a little bit weve mostly been able to come out with pretty good finishes

8511541 prehistoric objects have in a way become creative playthings over the last three years
8511542 working with the team in the museum weve done some extraordinary things with them though with the greatest care and respect of course
8511543 to be able to use them through the medium of animation within the landscape and amongst the monuments from which they came and with the people of the isle of anglesey seems extraordinarily powerful
8511544 this is as far as im aware completely unique a first for wales
8511545 the legacy of the islands extraordinary heritage lies in a rich array of prehistoric monuments and objects spanning at least 5 000 years of history

8511563 i think the convention has gone pretty well so far what do you think
8511564 the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened
8511565 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8511566 barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8511567 too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8511568 with the off season moves that weve made we can play at a high level still thats yet to be seen of course to me its something you look at as a challenge and you dont let it defeat you you deal with it you dont hide from it its a tough day its not good news
8511569 upset he wont be there to start camp but he is strong and i know he will be all right im not worried
8511570 its not a good thing but again i think montas showed over the course of his short career his toughness and his resiliency and ability a lot of times to take some tough situations and make the best of them
8511571 this training camp was going to be an important part for his development no question
8511572 we talk a lot about our young players and how to develop them get production out of them
8511573 with a guy like monta thats going to be out some of those difficulties in developing young players go away those guys are going to get some minutes

8511580 mr wilsons central involvement in the cold war in south asia does not warrant the honor of establishing a university chair in his name
8511581 a named chair sends a public message that not only the holder of the chair but its donor represent standards to which the university and larger community should aspire
8511582 theres a range of sentiments from mild to outrage truly we had assumed this thing was not going to go anywhere
8511583 or if it did we would be consulted we learned about the charlie wilson chair not from the south asian institute or the dean but from the newspapers

8511586 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8511587 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business in iraq but its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else then thats where we need to be
8511588 we are reviewing existing orders and inventories to address delivery commitments and maintain efficient operations during this curtailment
8511589 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8511590 we learned the dignity of work and we were told that anyone can make it if they try
8511591 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8511592 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8511593 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8511594 or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8511595 now after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home john mccain was wrong barack obama was right
8511596 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8511597 lets declare together with one voice right here right now barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8511598 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since
8511599 has convinced me that barack obama is the man for the job
8511600 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8511601 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8511602 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8511603 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy

8511608 two things bring little towns together tragedy and celebration of success
8511609 it was like everybody was related or we felt like we were
8511610 they were so excited and upset that they hadnt gone
8511611 those kids did something theyll remember the rest of their lives
8511612 coach can we get back any faster than it took to get here
8511613 its a lot more aggressive than what you usually see
8511614 i think the airlines crystal balls are telling them its going to be a soft fall
8511615 airlines are creatures of habit and theyve never really done this before
8511616 i think they want to make sure those planes are full so theyre topping them off with these cheap fares
8511617 people giving themselves more time taking more connections using more of those options when they fly
8511618 a lot of consumers are getting very savvy about ways to save money
8511619 it will be interesting to see how this plays out
8511620 so you may want to go out and find that cheap fare now
8511621 peoples english is not as good they get overwhelmed have financial problems or illness they get depressed and fail their studies and next thing they know they are on a roller coaster and have lost control of their lives
8511622 the trauma period is within a few to 10 days especially if they dont know how long they would be incarcerated for
8511623 should minimise the need for detention and ensure a proper allowance for associated refugee claims
8511624 shocking to know that its such a big export industry for australia where students are treated as cash cows yet others are receiving such harsh treatment in detention if they overstay they should be deported
8511625 es a partir de septiembre de 2007 cuando comienza a estabilizarse el n mero de solicitudes
8511626 they were packed with the label guaranteed fresh but they were very soft and floating in a pinkish liquid
8511627 when i queried this with the staff i was told that the chicken had been supplied frozen and then defrosted before being repacked for sale as fresh
8511628 i believe that what checkers is doing is a health hazard plus its dishonest
8511629 it is then defrosted under controlled conditions in the cold room and repacked and vacuum packaged before display
8511630 any liquid present in the package should only be the saline solution injected by chicken manufacturers to enhance the tenderness of the product
8511631 the issue regarding the quality of the previously frozen chicken breast fillets purchased at checkers cresta was caused by a discipline problem in this butchery concerning the label which is being addressed with the staff concerned
8511632 i can assure you that all butcheries will receive a directive to check their label usage of this product as well as the conditions under which the product is to be treated
8511633 the instruction for our meat markets is that this particular product has to contain beef but it seems the ingredient declaration went by unnoticed
8511634 beef water textured soy protein salt hydrolysed vegetable protein phosphate colourant and preservatives sodium sulphite antioxidants
8511635 in response to consumer demand in the face of escalating food prices
8511636 it is still the same recipe as ground beef regular but with clearer communication on the label to prevent any confusion among consumers
8511637 we have highlighted the soy ingredient and removed the reference to regular as consumer feedback made us aware that the word regular may be taken as referring to minced meat
8511638 we call the product ground beef to distinguish it from pure minced meat we feel that the new label which should reach stores soon will leave no room for misinterpretation
8511639 the consumer is led to believe that the supermarkets store brand products are less expensive than branded products due to non branding and less attractive packaging
8511640 will not always be the lowest price in store across the range
8511641 in categories that this price position can be maintained as per the original claims in 1976

8511643 the messenger of allaah used to accept gifts and reward people for giving them
8511644 whoever does you a favour respond in kind and if you cannot find the means of doing so then keep praying for him until you think that you have responded in kind
8511645 whoever has a favour done for him and says jazaak allaahu khayran has done his utmost to thank him
8511646 if you are unable to give him back in kind then speak at length thanking him and supplicating for him
8511647 exchange gifts as that will lead to increasing your love to one another
8511648 hey i noticed that you are passing these tracts out and well i am the one of the pastors who but this on and we just dont want people to get religion shoved down their throats
8511649 you guys dont have to listen to what she is saying
8511650 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature
8511651 shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it
8511652 the treatments that she billed for were not done and even if they had been done they would have served no purpose other than to defraud the insurers
8511653 no i dont so i think he has to find a southern state that he can carry look the numbers are the numbers and he has got to have at least one southern state
8511654 i think he can win but he also needs the south democrats have to compete across all 50 states and he is committed to doing that so i think you are likely to see him campaigning across the south and trying to pick up one or two of those states
8511655 some of this could be chess strategy but it may be a genuine shot at trying to take it
8511656 it is going to be a steep hill to climb this is going to be a very very close election i think what happens between now and and election day is going to decide who wins it is not yet decided
8511657 cara yang cepat untuk menjadi kaya buat pesepakbola yang kurang punya ambisi
8511658 itu seperti sebuah ceret yang menghina ketel dengan sebutan hitam inggris memiliki liga yang menarik tapi jika anda melihat lebih jauh lagi mereka banyak memiliki pelatih asing mayoritas pemainnya juga warga asing dan bahkan klubnya dimiliki oleh orang dari penjuru dunia
8511659 saya rasa mereka tak dalam posisi untuk bisa mengkritik liga italia lagipula menurut saya ronaldinho atau andriy shevchenko belumlah tua
8511660 saya senang karena kami memainkan dua pertandingan dan semuanya menang namun itu sulit kami sekarang akan menghadapi derby besar dan semua dalam tim sangat baik
8511661 klub sedang mencoba menanamkan citranya di kawasan yang lebih luas merekrut pemain dengan nama besar mungkin akan membantu hal tersebut dan membantu saya tapi takkan membantu tim jika anda membeli pemain yang sudah di ujung karir dan hanya ingin mencari bayaran terakhirnya
8511662 mereka takkan mendekati tim saya jika tak mampu membantu kami mencoba membawa klub maju dalam setiap aspek jika saya merasa seorang pemain tak bisa memberikan apa apa buat tim tak peduli siapa dia dia takkan bergabung
8511663 saya pikir kami melihat piala super sebagai ajang dengan sekali kesempatan dan kami jelas ingin memenanginya tapi itu juga jadi kesempatan tampil buat anderson yang kembali dari olimpiade nani yang bisa bermain setelah suspension dan kalau mungkin gary neville yang kembali usai cedera saya pikir tiga orang itu akan tampil jumat nanti
8511664 patrice evra dan wayne rooney juga akan terlibat setelah itu tergantun siapa yang sudah kembali dari cedera jika owen hargreaves bisa mempertahankan performanya saat latihan maka dia akan bermain saya pikir kami akan memainkan tim tangguh walau akan ada beberapa perubahan
8511665 arshavin terbang bersama kami ke monako tapi saya belum memutuskan apakah dia akan bermain atau tidak

8511675 between the uncertainty surrounding the closure of the temporary shelters and the inability or reluctance of refugees to reintegrate into local communities the preferred solution for a growing number of them is to return to their countries of origin
8511676 its better than going back to a community that doesnt want you
8511677 we need a few things some floor the luggage conveyor thing and then the new building will be finished

8511682 even when women are aggrieved according to our culture men have to speak on their behalf
8511683 as women we have the right to freedom of expression life treatment and care which is what we are calling for through this march
8511684 im here with my wife and two children because i hope this march is going to touch governments heart
8511685 besides the fact that we take arvs on an empty stomach the tablets are now rationed
8511686 we used to get 60 tablets to last us the whole month but now that has been halved because we are told that the arvs are not enough to give the months supply
8511687 while the country is affected by a number of socio economic challenges we find it inappropriate for government to finance some activities that are neither priority nor of interest such as the trip that has been undertaken by emakhosikati to his majesty the king children aides bodyguards and their maids
8511688 however we have not seen any concerted efforts by government to build more classrooms to accommodate the number of children into school no increase in the uptake of teachers to cater for the increased number of children in schools and we have no additional budget for school equipment and materials to cater for the high number of children
8511689 we would be less concerned about this particular trip if it was not funded by the central bank which is money from the taxpayer
8511690 what is depressing is that it is the same minister who allocated and approved the funds for the trip of the nine wives their children bodyguards and relatives who have left the country to various international destinations
8511691 if what they are complaining about is reversible then we can reverse and if we cant reverse it government will see what can be done so that it doesnt happen again
8511692 every funder that we talked to was very concerned that the threat of closure represents an attack on the ability of a productive academic unit to do its work without interference
8511693 when a clampdown on academic freedom appears imminent of course we have to drop our project work and mount a strong defence
8511694 that in turn sends signals of insecurity to funders which in turn require a very strong motion of confidence luckily that came last week in the faculty boards vote to retain ccs by 33 1
8511695 it can be a byzantine maze working through the university
8511696 we dont know which way management will be going or if we are on a safe track but we as ccs are planning to intensify and expand our work
8511697 the threat of closure of ccs has done community groups a huge disservice already
8511698 if the water rights project is put on hold it will be a real problem for us because ccs offers an important conduit for education and for communities to understand issues
8511699 for most of august we were not sure wed have any funding to arrange regular meetings to get to some of the roots of xenophobia such as service delivery failure which is often ignored
8511700 our desire to work with communities on anti xenophobia was thrown into question at a crucial moment
8511701 from march onwards the university administration has failed to respond to a february ukzn review recommendation that we be given many more honorary researcher positions
8511702 we were also hoping to acquire a formal accreditation that would draw them into our formal research programme that was also stalled unnecessarily
8511703 we were informed on july 30 that contracts of all staff except mine would be terminated
8511704 we have funding to operate for the next two years there is no logic in the argument
8511705 the centres approach to knowledge production is that the research generated sometimes threatens the privileges of power
8511706 there has long been a tense relationship between the centre and makgoba

8511712 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8511713 i am here for everyone i grew up with in scranton and wilmington
8511714 i am here for the cops and firefighters the teachers and assembly line workers the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the american dream endures
8511715 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8511716 folks remember when the world used to trust us when they looked to us for leadership with barack obama as our president theyll look to us again theyll trust us again and well be able to lead again
8511717 just as torontonians rejected attempts by the south african regime to rebrand apartheid in the 1980s we will also refuse to buy into this latest attempt to change the subject and divert attention away from israels state sanctioned racism
8511718 the world increasingly rejects settler colonialism whether here on turtle island north america or in israel just as apartheid fell in south africa it will fall in turtle island and israel
8511719 we have our own tensions between the ethiopian and somali communities ever since the illegal us backed ethiopian occupation of somalia there are all kinds of amends to be made that will take a long of time healing and relationship building for an external group of white people who know nothing about either of our communities to think they can appear from out of nowhere and build bridges between us is insulting it demonstrates an embarrassing level of cultural ignorance and incompetence if the israel rebranding campaign continues with this level of incompetence its failure is inevitable
8511720 brick by brick wall by wall israeli apartheid is going to fall
8511721 i neeeeeed foooooood whats still open while i hobble home at 4am
8511722 not only a last chance for a president of the united states to be relevant but for the people in the region to reach an accommodation its one of these strange situations where we know what the answer is and the idea is getting people to it
8511723 we must end the stress and heartache the war in iraq has caused our military families
8511724 barack obama will guarantee our troops equal time at home for length of their deployments john mccain opposes it
8511725 gaza is on the threshold of becoming the first territory to be intentionally reduced to a state of abject destitution with the knowledge acquiescence and some would say encouragement of the international community

8511732 you never know whats going to be effective you have to do what you can one of the things that we can do is stand out here and let them know that a celebration of the naqba is not going to go unchallenged
8511733 people dont realize that the biggest money in the entire world budget for foreign aid goes to israel
8511734 and most of it goes to arms its being done in our name the exploitation of the palestinians is the same as the exploitation of the people in the community i live in in detroit
8511735 madam secretary on behalf of the great state of new york with appreciation for the spirit and dedication of all who are gathered here with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8511736 i move that senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8511737 because youve come here from so many different places and made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8511738 she not only earned my vote but she deserved my vote today
8511739 if she was a little more concrete in her approval of obama that would put a lot of the confusion to rest
8511740 pare back the breadth and strength of what he proposes
8511741 and he and his friends will go back to saying no no no to the change we so desperately need
8511742 the opportunity is too great the stakes too high to allow president obamas agenda to be blocked by the special interests and their allies in the senate
8511743 blog readers should remember that reading and commenting on a blog is a privilege that can be revoked at any time
8511744 the press still own us an approach that will help to overthrow prejudices against indigenous peoples and question the idea that the amazon can survive to the extensive livestock and agriculture

8511748 last night hillary told you she was going to do everything in her power to elect barack obama that makes two
8511749 concern about the plight of the palestinian people under foreign occupations
8511750 it is only one paragraph that mentions the palestinians so the interest of israel was never badly damaged
8511751 all of these african victims and millions more in the future are harmed by the conferences failure to ensure accountability for crimes committed in african countries
8511752 until israel stops its crimes against the palestinian people and implements international law and human rights

8511759 last year going into the missouri game i didnt know what to expect
8511760 i just wanted to get into it and see what its like but this year i know what to expect and ill be more relaxed
8511761 as his role expands as he continues to progress as a receiver we expect his role to progress
8511762 its all about touches but were not trying to reinvent the wheel by putting rejus benn at quarterback
8511763 its a chance to help my team and put the offense in better position
8511764 i can catch more passes give up my body for more balls a lot of stuff i was limited because of my shoulder
8511765 and ill always block im more confident what i can do
8511766 i feel a lot better the game has slowed down i know what to do im expected to do a lot of things
8511767 i couldnt get my arms up and i just dealt with it and took my lumps i havent reached my full potential i want to show people the real arrelious benn
8511768 a 1 000 yard season more touchdowns take on a bigger role
8511769 last year against penn state i questioned whether he was hurt he broke so many tackles when hes hurt he wont let you know im happy hes 100 percent because people can see what he can do when hes 100 percent it will amaze you when you see what he can do at 100 percent

8511771 very proud that the movie is surviving the nonsense people are getting to see the movie its sort of starting to have a cult life
8511772 made a f ing great movie and the politics that are being visited upon it have nothing to do with the movie at all this is all about ego and though i mourn the fact that midnight meat train was never given its chance in theaters its a beautifully stylish scary movie and it isnt going anywhere people will find it and whether they find it in midnight shows or they find it on dvd theyll find it and in the end the joe drakes of the world will disappear

8511777 if our partners want to maintain good relations with russia they will understand our decision
8511778 we have noted the latest developments of the situation and we hope relevant parties find a proper resolution of the issue through dialogue
8511779 but silence on this question will de facto mean agreement and more importantly china will move to block any economic sanctions against russia within the un

8511784 for me to reach out to the community is huge
8511785 i didnt have a whole lot of that when i was growing up in sacramento
8511786 its hard to get rhythm there because they are switching quarterbacks all the time
8511787 me and bobby wade were talking about it a couple of days ago i played with 12 different quarterbacks there and caught a ball from nine or 10
8511788 bernard is something we wanted to add vertical speed and playmaking after the catch
8511789 besides randy moss he was the next best vertical guy on the market so it was taking a good player from a division rival we were willing to go out and get him
8511790 hes a lot tougher than i gave him credit for
8511791 certainly he is a talented guy who can stretch the field but he has a good feel for shallow crosses and slants too
8511792 he allows a lot of one on one situations teams eventually will have to roll coverages to bernard because he stretches defenses
8511793 there is a lot more freedom in this offense so im capable of a lot more
8511794 youre not stuck running the routes its friendlier and more flexible depending on what the defense is doing
8511795 vale m s p jaro en mano que ciento volando
8511796 people always say its me following mo around or whatever but you just heard the real story
8511797 whatever it is he needs to get better hes going to do it that makes it 10 times easier because now i dont worry about him not knowing what hes supposed to do all we have to do is just play
8511798 what the middle backer does and what the linebackers do as a unit theyre playing off what the defensive line does
8511799 and then the safeties and the corners are playing off what the linebackers do it all ties in together theres a lot of carry over from different packages
8511800 if you just watch mo even without him saying things his actions speak volumes
8511801 by brian playing next to him sticking with him hanging with him its helping him develop how to make adjustments how to get into position when you see mo do it you say ok thats how i should do it
8511802 the jump in the plays i made were simply because i took film more seriously and i got in the weight room all the things he has done
8511803 i just wanted to show him if youre sharp youre going to play
8511804 its good to have confirmation on the field right next to me in times of doubt

8511829 estoy asombrada de c mo se puede difamar tan abiertamente
8511830 thats why the father and son moment is going to be one of the most special trips well ever take together
8511831 dumpling man is a great cheap east village hot spot
8511832 shukhov licked the evaporating atoms of bitter juice from the fish bones carefully as he knew it would be all he could hope to eat for the next seventeen days
8511833 saya akan menjalani musim yang berat bersama united dan inggris jadi saya ingin segera sembuh dari cedera ini
8511834 saya sudah merasakan cedera ini selama 16 bulan bahkan kadang kadang lebih dan kadang kadang kurang ini merupakan sesuatu yang harus saya atasi
8511835 all of my business will come from word of mouth i dont need to advertise
8511836 i had something called the greg roll and it is one of the best rolls i have ever had
8511837 i should head right down court street put my gym clothes on and get myself to the treadmill a nice salad afterwards maybe some grilled salmon and then catch up on the news before bed
8511838 a quick detour down montague will land you one of the best burgers on this planet at least seven whole potatoes worth of fries and enough peanuts to cause your clothing to become a health hazard if you walk by the wrong person then you can plop on the couch and watch golden girls reruns until you eat yourself into a food coma
8511839 oh my gosh whats wrong with you two you guys are eating bambi and thumper
8511840 would you like an order of fries that doesnt seem like much food
8511841 everyone was dressed to the nines at brasserie 8 1 2
8511842 take for example the gasworks regeneration in south belfast its acknowledged that it has not met the needs of local communities
8511843 how are they learning those lessons how are they making sure local people are gaining employment gaining the housing issues tackling the education and unemployment problems as well
8511844 its not being done or least its evident in these plans
8511845 never been but ive heard like getting undies and prophylactics at the last min
8511846 if you wanna get a bath go jump in the east river
8511847 from the mixed up files of mrs basil e frankweiler
8511848 damn these guys are selling their paintings outside the museum and theyre amazing gee my paintings must suck ass because they are not even that close to being this good
8511849 dont go for the bait about what this means for black folk what this means for all folk is what this is about hes not too black hes not too white hes just right for america
8511850 send them all on vacation without spending all that money
8511851 now you know the one who holds onto all of her money
8511852 i dont know what that says about me or our country but never
8511853 i met hillary even shook her hand at a book signing about 10 years ago
8511854 she was really nice but i always vote based on the quality of the person not by the shade of their skin
8511855 black people got a bad rap when our votes shifted to barack that it was all race pride that flies in the face of the facts which is that blacks at the beginning of the year supported hillary by 3 to 1 it makes me angry because it is dismissive and perpetuates stereotypes we are trying to explode as a party
8511856 they get to vote for someone who reflects the world as they live in and see it they do not carry the racial baggage that my generation carries when obama speaks of looking past racial class and gender divisions hes talking about the world they already live in
8511857 i thought i would see in my lifetime a black man be nominated for president but that that would be the end of the road
8511858 we are praying that this is not it but the general indicators are questionable
8511859 there is a strong undercurrent of hesitation about this candidacy out there because of this big fear
8511860 it is rarely spoken of but i think its real it is a sad statement
8511861 i came to denver because this is an historical event and while i am still very cynical about this country and the world i think senator obamas nomination is different for younger people
8511862 my mom went to segregated schools and lived that life for her it is a stretch to see a black man running the country
8511863 for me i have always seen black people in positions of power so it is different for me
8511864 desmiento categ ricamente que haya un condicionamiento o algo que se le parezca
8511865 mais cest pour faire du margiela regarde la photo l
8511866 after 2005 when a hurricane blows in guys tend to prepare for the worst
8511867 its a situation where simply you dont want to be the guy caught short because someone will be
8511868 barack obama est preparado para liderar estados unidos y restaurar su liderazgo en el mundo barack obama est listo para ser presidente de estados unidos
8511869 hillary os dijo ayer de una manera inequ voca que har lo posible para que obama salga elegido en noviembre este compromiso habla por los dos
8511870 los republicanos me dec an que era muy joven y muy inexperto para ser el comandante en jefe os suena familiar no les funcion en 1992 y no les funcionar ahora porque barack obama est en el lado correcto de la historia
8511871 nuestro pa s es menos seguro y est m s aislado ahora que en ning n otro momento en la historia reciente
8511872 customers are calling us to find out the resale value of dda flats which they may be alloted the profit that a customer will make on the resale would range between rs 35 lakh and 50 lakh for a three bedroom apartment of 1 614 square feet in the west delhi locality of pitampura
8511873 the mid end segment market will certainly shift towards the dda apartments since they are available at a much lower cost with high resale value but the premium segment will remain unaffected as the customer for this segment will never go for dda flats
8511874 my parents taught us to live our faith and to treasure our family we learned the dignity of work and we were told that anyone can make it if they just try hard enough that was americas promise
8511875 today that american dream feels like it is slowly slipping away
8511876 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure
8511877 you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he had tapped into the oldest belief in america we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it and change it is exactly what barack obama will do thats what hell do for this country
8511878 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need barack obamas going to deliver that change
8511879 bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8511880 we were here first its not fair for them to have a job
8511881 we were here first its not fair for them to have a job
8511882 sebagai ketua pembangkang di parlimen kita harap beliau akan menyumbang dengan baik kepada perjalanan amalan demokrasi dan membantu kita dalam usaha kita memajukan lagi negara kita

8511888 there are id procedures that need to take place and they could all be jeopardised if his name or description is released at this stage
8511889 when i am president you will be forgotten no more
8511890 with people who have a lot of gifts its hard for people to identify with them
8511891 barack obama is handsome hes incredibly bright hes incredibly well spoken and hes incredibly successful not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8511892 there are so many things about our candidate that are different that the challenge that we have is to give people a confidence that despite all these things that feel different okay i get what hes about personally that his family is like every other family that your kids go to school with
8511893 people need to know that the president is awake gets it isnt in some cocoon or bubble somewhere
8511894 as close to street level as possible really identify with these people
8511895 waiting to see that hes angry about that stuff too not just that he thinks its wrong intellectually that hes angry
8511896 i get mad i get frustrated the thought of it makes my blood boil
8511897 eu mai presus ma aflu de curatie sau necuratie de zel de orice fel si trandavie in adoratia ce mi se aduce slavirea mea eu nu mi am randuit o intru folosul meu nu ci o cer doar din iubire pentru slujitorii mei sfintit eu nu sunt prin felu n care ei m adora ci ei prin ei insisi curati si straluciti devin eu nu ma uit la limbi si la vorbire eu la camara cea launtrica ma uit si la simtire
8511898 mai bine sa nu vorbeasca decat cei care cu adevarat stiu ceva
8511899 si apropos eu nu sustin neaparat punctul de vedere al bisericii oficiale ci e vorba de propriile mele intelegeri
8511900 i had to work quite hard in finding a very particular way for that snitch to be caught because i knew i was going to do that later initially as my british editor can confirm i had hedwig catch that snitch she wanted that changed and i thought oh god back to the drawing board actually thats what sealed hedwigs fate because the plan was for hedwig to open the snitch because she touched it first but by making it harry then it was time to kill her earlier i think she was going to die anyway eventually
8511901 wait what does that mean is she shes dead noo
8511902 will have nowhere else to go short of pre emptive strikes against irans nuclear facilities
8511903 if we had some eggs we could have ham and eggs if we had some ham
8511904 keep the americans in the germans down and the russians out
8511905 the cities power plants and factories we build in the next seven years will shape our climate in mid century we have to act now to price carbon and create incentives to change the way we use energy and spread technology and thereby avert nothing less than an existential threat to civilization
8511906 the foreign service is not the foreign legion and the peace corps with guns
8511907 but we share this unique connection an additional special bond between us that is rare
8511908 our troops are courageous strong fierce this administration has redeployed them until they are overstretched stressed and strained
8511909 too often they get bureaucracy not benefits they find inadequate access inferior facilities and infuriating paperwork
8511910 it is not possible for the state government to hand over the agreement without the consent of the tatas
8511911 kenapa pialang tersebut hanya ditutup saja tidak ada kejelasan hukum atau sanksi lainnya terlebih nasib para mantan nasabah juga belum jelas
8511912 kami sudah mendatangi bbj polda departemen perdagangan bahkan istana negara
8511913 usulan kami jika disepakati bersama membatasi jumlah kendaraan kendaraan berbahan bakar premium lebih besar sama dengan 2 000 cc tidak diperkenankan membeli bbm bersubsidi
8511914 inga underlag fanns f r rendet inf r styrelsem tet och rendet hade inte beretts p annat s tt jag fick ett klart intryck att verrumplingstaktik fanns bakom s ttet att ta upp och driva rendet och komma fram till beslut

8511917 ini band baru istilahnya perusahaan baru gimana caranya bisa bikin lagu yang hits populer dan dapat duit banyak
8511918 bila kita berhasil negosiasi sejak itu tanggung jawab ada di tangan saya sebagai presiden saya tidak melempar tanggung jawab kepada wapres atau tim apabila nanti ada permasalahan seperti kemarin menaikkan bbm yang bertanggung jawab kan saya bukan menteri ekonomi
8511919 memang kalau kita pelajari apabila kontrak ini tidak diperbaharui dengan harga sekarang maka akan besar sekali kerugian negara dibanding dengan penjualan gas gas yang lain seperti di cepu dan lain lain
8511920 kalau tidak kita perjuangkan berapa kontrak kontrak lain akan gagal ini yang mesti kita perjuangkan negosiasikan dengan niat baik itu agar negara tidak dirugikan wapres kemarin sudah ke rrc dan membuka pintu untuk negoiasai insya allah ada celah
8511921 klien kami sudah melimpahkan hartanya kepada al el dul ini kemauan mas dhani atas pertemuan dengan mba maia langsung dikonkritkan tapi pihak sana konkrit nggak
8511922 sita marital tidak ada hubungannya dengan gugatan cerai harus diajukan sendiri lagipula penetapan sita masih sangat jauh menunggu sidang perceraian selesai baru bisa mengajukan
8511923 lebaran tahun lalu anak anak nggak boleh bersama aku aku mau sama anak anak harusnya kan adil lebaran harusnya jatah aku
8511924 kalaupun nanti anak anak diserahkan ke aku pasti mereka akan leluasa ketemu ayahnya aku aja dihalangi sama mas dhani buat ketemu tapi saya akan terus berdoa itu masalah waktu ridho aja
8511925 pokoknya apa alasan saya menggugat cerai tidak bisa saya katakan kepada teman teman karena biar ini menjadi rahasia kami
8511926 keputusan ini sejak enam bulan lalu saya renungkan benar benar saya pikirkan dengan matang
8511927 i use the computer for my online casinos analysis models as well as general company accounting
8511928 we chose to use perl in our online casinos text studies because it is a lingual programming language
8511929 and also because it is easy to combine with other programming languages perl is easily installed on linux platforms and modules can be compiled that allow us to communicate with database technologies
8511930 with increased profits well be able to hire more employees and really grow our business
8511931 on more than just one level as a reporter its a great story and as a citizen of snellman petrauskas borough i know that my neighbors will still have their jobs one has to realize that this will only strengthen the local economy and drive new business to our area these factors are key to economic survival and to my fellow citizens as we move forward in the next few years
8511932 were proud to announce news that our online casinos company has devised new algorithms and computer models for enhanced online casinos analysis
8511933 and as a result were expecting nearly double last quarters profits in the coming months
8511934 and were happy to also announce our own software team has developed important online casinos production algorithms that will boost our profits dramaticly
8511935 id like to personally thank bebe darnick and glod tapanes for the work theyve done on this project
8511936 without their efforts our company would need be able to meet the demands of the burgeoning consumer market when demand increases the only way to provide for this change is an increase in technology most importantly we wont be laying anyone off all current employees in our roemen lavole county plant and all online casinos project employees will be guaranteed employment for 3 years
8511937 well be hiring more workers within the next 6 months why because while some jobs will be made redundant in the new profit model we can take the talents of these valuable employees and parlay them into other equally paying jobs within our corporate structure
8511938 mostly because well need time to train these employees to be as effective online casinos producers as possible
8511939 were excited to learn that over 1000 new jobs will be created
8511940 the mall traffic is ok but not very high quality now with over 1000 new people visiting each day business will surely skyrocket
8511941 attempting to take pictures on a public sidewalk of democratic senators and vip donors leaving a private meeting
8511942 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8511943 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8511944 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8511945 barack obama is the man for this job barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8511946 thats one of the things i admire about him hes a real spouse and he reacts the way a real spouse does
8511947 he didnt like when his wife was attacked and he responded accordingly and thats the way i hope my spouse would have reacted if i was attacked
8511948 mr clinton sought and often managed to convince americans that the global economy was an opportunity and not a threat
8511949 whatever his legacy from this campaign that legacy of his presidency should be built upon
8511950 hes sort of yesterdays man trying to be todays man and he seems angry about it
8511951 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
8511952 well that is our job we dont technically get money for you
8511953 we look forward to working with amazon to continue with our mission of building great communities that celebrate books
8511954 rumah ini milik abdul qodir jaelani tidak ada satu iblis pun boleh merampas
8511955 we had to win as many scholarships as we could because my mom couldnt help us through college very much
8511956 without the scholarships i won i wouldnt be able to go to college it takes a load off of our shoulders
8511957 my main goal is to be a physician i would like to get hands on experience in the army in nursing and then have them pay for medical school
8511958 i applied for it and had to compete with other students
8511959 after i was interviewed for it i expressed how much i would appreciate love and be honored to receive it i was lucky to be chosen i feel obligated to continue to do well
8511960 it is a big help college is getting more expensive year by year its not that i wouldnt have gotten to go to college i am the type of person that would have found a way to get there but it definitely took a load off my mind and made things a lot easier
8511961 i think they selected me because i am a hard worker i am true pittsburgher through and through as long as you work hard people will notice you this is the first scholarship i received and it was a great feeling to know someone noticed the things i have done and achieved
8511962 in order to fix what is wrong there will be some short term pain but in the end it will be worth it
8511963 hey its going to suck with no end but it will do so slowly but continuous so you wont notice as much and we will placate any one who puts up too much of a fuss
8511964 my client wishes to advise that she is concentrating on her recovery as this is the paramount consideration at this point in time
8511965 she has expressed some disappointment in the number of inaccuracies contained in much of the media coverage of the incident however under legal advice she has not yet released her statement of events
8511966 i have helped clients use excel word access and even powerpoint to extract data from sql server for years
8511967 i would be especially interested in this i work at a college and higher level administrators are always concerned about enrollment overall in certain programs etc they dont want numbers per se just quick visual confirmations unless it is red and they have to look at more detail i know there is dashboard software out there but if i could accomplish this sort of stuff in excel i would love that because they all know how to use excel sounds really cool i am going to have to play with this
8511968 in my organization weve been working with having sql server communicate with exchange and ultimately outlook 2007
8511969 wd continues to offer enterprise customers the best combination of features optimum performance and superior reliability
8511970 weve refined our manufacturing techniques and redesigned our low density ssds to get what the low priced pc market is looking for in the way of improved cost performance and availability
8511971 im coming up as a youngster coming from a new generation and joining them in a very good way
8511972 i jumped very high in the rankings i think thats going to help for our davis cup team and also for i believe younger ones that they can work more when they practice and play tournaments they will have us as their idols and thats really going to be big if i continue to play like this and of course if mario is going to be at the top germanys bob brett who once coached ivanisevic as well as boris becker tutors cilic brett is known as a stern tactician with a sound mind who knows how to steer his players through the rough and tumble jungle of the tour goran was finishing his career and he was practicing with me a lot when i was 14 15 and he put me together with brett and that helped me the most
8511973 from bob i learned a lot of things and he gave me a lot of influence and helped me a lot
8511974 i think im going to get much stronger physically as i stop growing upwards and now i can grow wider
8511975 i think thats going to help a lot as you become stronger your shots become more consistent and your serve gets better so i think thats going to be a big improvement in the next few years
8511976 because criminals are becoming more sophisticated rendering traditional security obsolete we focused on digging more deeply and broadly to stop attacks that bypass other security products in addition we put a great deal of emphasis on providing users with much more in depth protection against identity theft than any other internet security product

8511988 weve had the worst scandal in our history watergate and this nominee gerald ford pardoned the guy who did it
8511989 what time is it its time for them to go
8511990 look weve met this man we trust him weve look at him eye to eye and face to face and we can see into his heart and you can trust him
8511991 before i went overseas i might have thought that everybody needs to speak english who comes to america because
8511992 im taking spanish right now just because its a good skill to have i havent done it because i feel obligated
8511993 i know when foreigners come over here they should at least make an attempt to learn our language
8511994 last year i bought a polish dictionary and tried to learn certain basic words you almost have to learn the basics if you dont though im not sure about suspensions of membership for lpga players i think that might be a bit much
8511995 weve got a lot of guys coming in from different parts of the globe but weve got a lot of guys that were born in the states that struggle with common english
8511996 i think for the most part right now what helps us market is personality and the uniqueness of everyone being different and having a different path to get there
8511997 if youre in the united states yeah you have to do anything possible to at least say something in english i dont think that rule can come to the big leagues there are a lot of people who dont know how to speak english thats why they have translators
8511998 there are two primary avenues of legal assault to the lpgas new policy first does the policy violate the civil rights laws of the lpgas home state florida second what does english proficiency mean as applied it sounds simple but one test probably doesnt adequately demonstrate english proficiency will there be different standards for different ages different countries
8511999 it makes sense that the tour wants players to speak english its easier for players to deal with the media and it would make sponsors and pro am partners who pay big bucks to play and chat with tour stars happy whats unacceptable is the lpga is threatening a players livelihood with this demand and putting a timetable on it
8512000 players from mexico taiwan and korea have won the last five major championships and as the game continues to grow in nontraditional golf countries asia and latin america in particular the number of world class players for whom english is not the primary language will only increase the tightrope being walked here is between a practical and sensible business decision and the appearance of cultural chauvinism
8512001 i support the direction in which they are trying to move
8512002 the objective of having foreign players spend some time making this a priority as golfers from strictly a commercial standpoint is a positive its going to open up business opportunities for the players that are not there now

8512094 establish that the accused was not entitled to the amounts that he claimed and received as the result of his dishonest conduct
8512095 it is incumbent on the prosecution to do this in order to establish to the necessary degree that the accused had an intent to defraud when he forged and uttered the documents in support of his claims
8512096 in the circumstances it is not necessary to make any finding as to whether or not the accused had an honest belief that he was entitled to claim as he did
8512097 for these reasons i conclude that while the accused acted dishonestly in making the claims that he did it has not been established that he did so with the necessary intent to defraud
8512098 accordingly in due course there will be a judgment of acquittal in respect of each of the charges

8512113 vi har oplevet et stadig stigende omfang af grove beskyldninger mod vores medarbejdere og har nu besluttet at vi politianmelder den slags
8512114 vi g r det dels for at beskytte vores medarbejdere og vise at vi bakker dem op men ogs for at der ikke skal opst en tr thed i sagsbehandlingen hvis man til stadighed bliver truet p sin re og v rdighed s kan vi jo frygte at man bliver mindre nidk r i sager i for eksempel arbejdet med b rn og unge
8512115 vi griber ikke ind over for et enkelt vredt eller ulykkeligt menneske der en enkelt gang kommer med et udbrud men vi vil ikke finde os i systematiske og gentagne angreb

8512125 as a youngster all i wanted was to play for sri lanka
8512126 i remember when i got my first call up to the national team it was one dayer against india i had just turned 20 and arjuna ranatunga gave me the new ball ahead of the others navjot sidhu was my first wicket and that was after he had blasted a hundred

8512129 he has a groin problem so he will have an operation and could be out for 10 to 15 days
8512130 it is not serious but we need to do it now
8512131 he has been playing some games in pain not being 100 percent fit and we decided that this was the best moment for the operation
8512132 he had a problem for the first game with liege and also when he went away to play for england in their friendly last week against the czech republic
8512133 we talked with the doctor yesterday and today and it was decided that steven would play in this match with the pain but now we will have to get the situation solved

8512137 its simply a fact that the u s invades bombs occupies and interferes in the internal affairs of other countries far more than any other country on the planet its not even a close competition the most enduring and predominant rule of american politics is that every national politician must demonstrate their willingness even eagerness to start wars

8512142 the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
8512143 im trying to remember what year this compact was negotiated
8512144 due in great measure to the efforts of delph carpenter son of a weld county homesteader colorado entered into nine interstate water compacts
8512145 a development of the productive forces is the absolute practical premise of communism because without it want is generalized and that means that all the old crap must revive again
8512146 the mass carries out with matchless enthusiasm and discipline the tasks set by the government whether in the field of the economy culture defense sports etc the initiative generally comes from fidel or from the revolutionary leadership and is explained to the people who make it their own
8512147 armed struggle creates the objective conditions for winning power and in castros words those conditions can be created in the immense majority of latin american countries if between four and seven dedicated guerrillas can be found
8512148 from blanquis assumption that any revolution may be made by the outbreak of a small revolutionary minority follows of itself the necessity of a dictatorship after the success of the venture
8512149 this is of course a dictatorship not of the entire revolutionary class the proletariat but of the small minority that has made the revolution and who are themselves previously organized under the dictatorship of one or several individuals

8512152 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8512153 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8512154 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8512155 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8512156 he has played two crucial knocks and he is outstanding
8512157 at this level youngsters do not get many opportunities i am happy that they have grabbed the opportunities that came their way
8512158 i read the hands of murali and mendis my game plan was that if i could read their bowling i could play them well
8512159 our batting has let us down disappointed the way we played we had opportunities but we have not utilised but one day cricket cannot be predicted and is about opportunities overall performance with the bat has been inconsistent
8512160 this is a startling amount of change in a major area of peoples lives over a very short period
8512161 there was a subversion of the constitution on november 3 and that is what people are protesting against
8512162 we are committed to the supremacy of the constitution and this will continue until the actions of november 3 are reversed
8512163 while riding the course i kept thinking to myself that we must be on the wrong road there is just simply no way a time trial would have this much climbing
8512164 at the reassurance from my coach and much to my delight we were on the right course
8512165 i was then able to trace the entire course from the comfort of my home and find a similar route to train on back in boise
8512166 this capability along with having the elevation profile proved invaluable in my preparation for my gold medal race
8512167 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8512168 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8512169 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8512170 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8512171 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8512172 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8512173 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8512174 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything in her power to elect barack obama
8512175 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us
8512176 more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans that will swell the deficit increase inequality and weaken the economy more band aids for health care that will enrich insurance companies impoverish families and increase the number of uninsured more going it alone in the world instead of building the shared responsibilities and shared opportunities necessary to advance our security and restore our influence
8512177 will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years and back to hope
8512178 and so if you like me believe that america must always be a place called hope then join hillary and chelsea and me in making barack obama the next president of the united states
8512179 we were budgeting and everything and it was getting really close to going
8512180 but the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial which of course is kind of the point
8512181 it was a very faithful adaptation of the first few books nearly word for word they offered me the chance to redevelop it but i refused ive learned my lesson on that front and i wont do it again so im afraid its dead at hbo ink
8512182 you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold
8512183 we didnt discover our values in a poll taken a week before the convention and we didnt set a weather vane on top of the golden gate bridge before we started talking about the american family the choices this year are not just between two different personalities or between two political parties they are between two different visions of the future two fundamentally different ways of governing their government of pessimism fear and limits or ours of hope confidence and growth
8512184 the pundits the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states red states for republicans blue states for democrats but ive got news for them too we worship an awesome god in the blue states and we dont like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states
8512185 lets tell the truth it must be done it must be done mr reagan will raise taxes and so will i he wont tell you i just did
8512186 there is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the cold war itself
8512187 this administration has redeployed them until they are overstretched stressed and strained
8512188 barack obama understands that for a commander in chief to support the military he needs more than a mission accomplished banner more than a borrowed flight suit and definitely more than four more years of the same failed foreign policy
8512189 barack obama stands out because he understands that people want government to work for them again
8512190 during these tough economic times he is deeply concerned for our children our families and those who have been left behind
8512191 if the lord had not been on our side let israel say when the flood would have engulfed us the torrent would have swept over us the raging waters would have swept us away praise be to the lord who has not let us be torn by their teeth we have escaped like a bird out of the fowlers snare the snare has been broken and we have escaped our help is in the name of the lord the maker of heaven and earth
8512192 amtrak were one of several delivery firms that dabs com uses and we have plans in place to ensure that customers will not be adversely affected by what has happened

8512194 it is unreal it is unbelievable to see what is happening
8512195 as far as im concerned this was the turning point of the civil rights movement im absolutely convinced of that
8512196 for the first time in the history of america an african american will become the nominee of a major political party if someone had told me a few short years ago that this would be happening i would have said you are crazy
8512197 it it it is unreal i dont quite know what is going to be my reaction
8512198 some of the same people who will be voting in november could not register to vote 45 years ago

8512204 they spend a lot of time commuting or working and we would like to use that dead time to enable them to access services such as this one
8512205 we want to tap into the smaller towns and cities where our customers may not have access to the internet but can upload profiles using a preloaded application
8512206 of course the parents want to be involved in the process but they are also open to using newer platforms such as mobiles to scout for their soul mate
8512207 i would like to hunt for my ideal partner but wheres the time this way i can look for him while i am travelling or working
8512208 veoh has a strong dmca policy takes active steps to limit incidents of infringement on its website and works diligently to keep unauthorized works off its site
8512209 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8512210 the decision rendered here is confined to the particular combination of facts in this case and is not intended to push the bounds of the safe harbor so wide that less scrupulous service providers may claim its protection
8512211 what youve heard is absolutely right this is unprecedented and overwhelming ive never gone through this experience before throughout my performance at the 02 arena the audience didnt sit at all all 20 000 of them stood on their feet while i performed
8512212 it was a deeply moving and humbling experience ive never been in a performance like this ever and perhaps the audience too had never felt like this before the entire venue was sold out we all got standing ovations the audience just freaked out
8512213 lets admit it the crowds came in such huge numbers mainly to see the big b we were the side attractions the way the audiences everywhere reacted to him had to be seen to be believed
8512214 the u s olympic committee is making a tremendous investment in building the paralympic movement in the united states that commitment has helped significantly raise the awareness of paralympic programs since 2004 and this broadcast agreement is clear evidence of the growing interest nationally in paralympic sport
8512215 the amazing platform provides an exceptional opportunity to showcase the talents of the 2008 u s paralympic team introduce more individuals with physical disabilities to the paralympic movement and inspire all americans

8512228 unamid strongly condemns the excessive disproportionate use of lethal force by the government of sudan security forces against civilians which violated their human rights and resulted in unacceptable casualties
8512229 that the presence of weapons voids the status of idp camps granted to them by international humanitarian law and exhorts the idp community and its leaders and representatives to ensure that their camps are and remain weapons free zones

8512263 i think brazil is doing the opposite adapting to what the world is offering now theyre doing it right
8512264 we need to give incentives to producers because people are buying and eating more
8512265 this is our opportunity to produce and export more and help to reduce hunger in the world

8512277 if you make a mistake on those backs youve got a problem im real excited
8512278 i hope we have enough balls to go around you can put any combination of guys out there and a lot of special things can happen
8512279 four of them you give them the ball and they can take it to the house from any place on the field thats a great thing to have
8512280 were going to try and put on a show in the running game

8512290 our goal is to have the best matchup we can put forward in an annual matchup
8512291 thats not always going to be acc sec but it makes sense to have one side of the game acc or sec

8512299 if youre invested in something then you respond to adversity
8512300 if youre not invested then theres nothing to respond to because youre not invested my guess would be that the reason were still so positive and were going to have a great year is because theres a lot of invested players theyre older and more mature its not the same as it was last year

8512311 butlers response to the trap of national narcissism is to turn to what she perceives to be the most specific and concrete ways of thinking about others namely an ethics of faciality borrowed from the thought of emmanuel levinas this response i believe is a dangerous one because in levinasian ethics an appreciation of attenuating circumstances the articulation of the incomplete and open in the end gives way to an exclusive recapitulation of the human so that what appears to be other than human still comes to appear as less than human

8512336 she disarmed a police officer twice and put him in such a difficult situation that he had to use potentially deadly force
8512337 the learned sentencing judge was entitled to reject that the motivation was to prevent injury to both parties because it was just a submission that was in no way supported by evidence
8512338 none of her actions assisted the police officer in any way
8512339 i am but a lowly stage designer trying my best to provide some sort of shooting challenge

8512349 this break was good to defuse some of the negative publicity surrounding the incident we had
8512350 we felt we have a good opportunity to compete for an eastern conference championship this year and next year
8512351 shes an experienced player and makes our team better with her calmness and her pointers to our players
8512352 all seven teams still have a legitimate shot and a strong chance to work themselves either back into the race or improve currently in the race
8512353 championships are won on the road but its a lot easier when youre at home
8512354 playing against seattle or san antonio youd want that homecourt advantage
8512355 experience the difference when you put christ first in all areas of your life

8512372 the scary thing is that everybody is saying we can compete for the title
8512373 im not comfortable with that it puts me a little uneasy
8512374 weve ridden this underdog thing pretty well for a while now
8512375 its been kind of fun to be under the radar and i agree with curry

8512386 to see germanys latest cash crop take a train across the flat plains between hannover and berlin or cruise the waters off the gusty north sea coast in both places you cant miss the rows of windmills marching to the horizon quietly generating some 7 of the nations electricity needs and powering an important new industry thanks to smart regulation germany has become a global powerhouse in green energy producing more electricity from wind than any other country while the industry owes some of its success to german expertise in fields such as aerodynamics the biggest boost has come from the government the nations energy law guarantees operators of windmills and solar generators an above market price for power for as long as 20 years other countries have similar policies but few have applied them as consistently as germany
8512387 i would argue that term limits for legislators are even more important than for executives

8512398 the heroes in most animations and movies dont age they are often immortal snake on the other hand has aged with the times i made him this way because of the unique characteristics of the game medium snake is a fictional character but at the same time he represents the players themselves because of the interactive nature of games this is very different from other types of entertainment mediums in which you just watch or listen therefore snakes memories become the players own journey in that sense i believe that interactive games are somewhat similar to live shows that reflect the signs of the times therefore this allowed me the opportunity to bring the character of snake to life and make the story more realistic by showing signs of his aging one decade has passed since the release of metal gear solid i believe that fans have shared these past 10 years with snake the final story of snake equals closure for these fans therefore the snake that has existed over the past 10 years could have only existed during this time i would like you to think that this good bye to snake is a good bye to this era and represents closure to your old self if there ever were to be a new snake might have a different name he will be a snake for a new era

8512419 the money created is just monetization of our future work its no big deal
8512420 the method of science is tried and true it is not perfect its just the best we have and to abandon it with its skeptical protocols is the pathway to a dark age
8512421 ive spoken to ian and i dont buy that comment
8512422 ive heard nothing from nick i have not been given any indication which direction hes going with his picks i have no clue what hes doing to do
8512423 its a difficult situation because if he was playing gleneagles this week he would basically give up his chance of winning the fedex cup
8512424 he gives up his chance to win 10 million dollars and the possibility of playing for huge world ranking points
8512425 having said that justin rose has been over there cementing his place in the team hes given up his chance of winning 10 million dollars saying its only money you cant take it with you
8512426 its great to see darren playing well on a personal level and its good from a euro golf standpoint
8512427 its nice to have a difficult situation like this because it means weve got lots of great players
8512428 when he left for work every day we never considered the danger an immediate threat but it was always in the back of our minds
8512429 its the last thing you would expect to hear to say i was devastated is the biggest understatement possible

8512431 barack obama ist bereit pr sident der vereinigten staaten zu sein
8512432 barack obama ist in der lage amerika zu f hren und die f hrung der usa in der welt wiederherzustellen
8512433 catholic groups demonstrated outside canada house in london on tuesday in protest against the deportation of us soldiers who refused to fight in iraq and sought asylum in canada
8512434 canada stop deporting us soldiers who refuse to fight in the illegal war in iraq
8512435 in the year that franz jagerstater was beatified by the pope in recognition of his conscientious objection and subsequent execution for refusing to serve in hitlers army it seems extraordinary that the canadian government is adopting this position these soldiers have every right to refuse to fight in an illegal war
8512436 now for a few updates on the home front army deserter robin long a boise native was sentenced to 15 months in jail after being kicked out of canada and returned to his unit at fort carson colo he will also get a dishonorable discharge

8512438 the most engaging aspect of the sutras is delgados quest for co status although hes ostracized for his stance overall hes treated quite fairly
8512439 the analysis by the times found that obama donors gave 300 000 to mrs clinton in july and 135 000 in june
8512440 the democrats nominated a junior inexperienced senator with no legislative accomplishments on his resume to whom young americans and latte liberals swarmed due to his cool celebrity like demeanor but then those same democratic leaders act surprised that middle america isnt following suit how bizarre
8512441 the meltdown of progressive blogosphere 1 0 is due in large part to major a list bloggers turning a blind eye to misogyny and sexism because it helped the candidate they supported massive fail
8512442 apart from their assertion which is false that obama will end the occupation of iraq the authors make no attempt to substantiate their claim that obama represents a stark ideological contrast with mccain in fact they virtually acknowledge just the opposite
8512443 the party is worried now about mass defections by clinton supporters to john mccain well what in the hell did they expect after the may 31 charade effectively handing obama the nomination they lost what little chance they had in the fall dont expect clinton supporters to get over it any more than gore supporters when the 2000 election was stolen
8512444 you know burke i dont know which species is worse you dont see them ing each other over for a percentage
8512445 ive had more people ask me about recycling in the past six months than in my first four years as mayor so obviously people are more aware and interested
8512446 we have a duty to watch the bottom line but this may be a case where the more responsible thing is to look beyond it id be very surprised if recycling doesnt happen in this administration
8512447 for a while there was some talk about recycling with modern disposal but it died for a lack of interest
8512448 rebuilding as a model green community focusing on energy self sufficiency and other principles of sustainability with the aim to become the greenest community in america
8512449 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer
8512450 if it does happen in september its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole

8512454 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8512455 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8512456 military ships are hardly a common way to deliver such aid
8512457 can nato which is not a state located in the black sea continuously increase its group of forces and systems there it turns out that it cannot
8512458 we sleep peaceably at night because rough men stand ready to do violence on our behalf

8512460 obamas close association with bill ayers in admitted domestic terrorist who planned to blow up government buildings including a police station and even the pentagon
8512461 i do know that 25 000 marines in a province again are probably in excess of the need especially after iraqi provincial control assumes responsibilities for security
8512462 the taliban are growing bolder in their tactics and clearly doing their best to exploit security gaps where they exist
8512463 weve seen families slaughtered weve seen policemen rounded up and executed with shots to the back of the head in the soccer stadium just to make the point and so thats what we risk if we dont somehow take advantage of those gains and maintain the momentum in that area
8512464 this is a significant milestone and for the rest of your life you can reflect with pride on your perseverance and dedication in completing your high school requirements
8512465 i really liked school the kids too knowledge is power
8512466 its a tough decision to make and they really deserve recognition
8512467 people were really comforted by the fact that we were all over the place
8512468 that is almost like having an extra couple of guys
8512469 it was really nice thing to have there it would help us localize any problems
8512470 it was mostly a family event you didnt see a lot of young single men or women going in in large groups
8512471 over and above the music it was a great social thing like a giant class reunion
8512472 there was a broad range of people out there babies teenagers and their parents even 70 year olds and everybody got along i think people are gonna be bummed out this friday
8512473 today workers at invesco field are putting the final touches on the newest wonder of the modern political world the temple of obama the barackopolis there may be some confusion among the press about the venue and appropriate dress code for barack obamas big speech to help out we wanted to provide the following tips on appropriate attire the toga may have gone out of style centuries ago but after obamas temple speech tomorrow night theyre sure to be flying off the racks
8512474 weve been making easy to use development tools for palm os and windows ce for many years
8512475 it was clear that symbian developers also needed a tool which would be friendly and easy to learn easy to deploy and well supported
8512476 we welcome the addition of ns basic symbian os to the set of development environments available for mobile developers
8512477 with the look and feel of visual basic it will allow many additional programmers to create apps for symbian devices
8512478 a fire like this its not overnight the flames go out it continues to linger with residents for months
8512479 it makes you think about that could have been my mother my grandmother a friend i know
8512480 the casa de vallejo houses some of vallejos best treasures
8512481 these are the seniors who fought in wars worked in our hospitals and theyre all from our community so we know them
8512482 if thousands of people show up and they mostly say good things well see it as a success
8512483 so all you bayview folks and folks all over the city we havent seen you in quite a while will you please join us
8512484 maybe we get into it through a collaborative effort with the advertising industry
8512485 i think some of them are gonna take a lot of vetting with the public and the elected officials but it makes sense
8512486 anything that would be able to help would definitely benefit the roads and the people driving on them so i think that would be a very good idea
8512487 im always looking because its going to warn me about an accident or an amber alert so i think with advertisements people wouldnt pay attention like they do today
8512488 do you have poles that go from the ceiling to the floor
8512489 more st clair shores businesses to accept customer loyalty card
8512490 the gotta h ave gift and rewards card a reference to the harper avenue business association will be showing up in several more businesses this week and next the program officially launched a month ago but most of that time has been spent outfitting businesses with software and taking care of other administrative needs
8512491 we continued to invest in price and gave increased focus to promotions both of which helped to drive sales and win customers but as anticipated impacted margins
8512492 in europe as part of albert heijns price positioning strategy food price inflation was only partially passed on to customers during the quarter and strong promotions including the euro 2008 football championships temporarily impacted margins
8512493 in the united states the value improvement program has now expanded beyond price repositioning to marketing and branding
8512494 we are confident we will manage the balance between sales growth and margin and deliver our underlying retail operating margin guidance for 2008 of 4 8 5 3
8512495 an dem ort den die wahrsagerin auf einer karte markiert hatte war nichts
8512496 as mobile messaging usage continues to grow at a rapid pace consumers and operators are demanding secure and reliable delivery of their messages verisign continues to raise the bar by providing unparalleled service and delivery at scale with 99 999 plus percent availability in the past 18 months and 100 percent availability for the last nine months
8512497 this is critical because as texting traffic will only continue to grow service providers and end users will need a network that they can count on
8512498 you dont need to pack any food were taking well just eat those all weekend half for dinner half for breakfast
8512499 the figures from the dsa show a considerable discrepancy between the pass rates for drivers in parts of wales
8512500 it does appear much harder to pass a driving test in north wales than for instance in parts of west wales
8512501 i will be writing to the dsa to find out if there are any local reasons for such a significant difference in pass rates across wales
8512502 im sure learner drivers would expect to be treated the same wherever they take their test
8512503 waiting times for driving tests also vary considerably which might suggest that there are not enough examiners in some areas
8512504 for instance there is a wait of three months in llanelli but half that time in cardiff or newport
8512505 the wealthier the town area the more likely people are able to invest more money on lessons and will have more opportunities for private practise and access to family vehicles etc
8512506 it would be highly improbable that every test centre would return the same pass rate country wide
8512507 every instructor around here will tell you that the pass rate is very low and were all worried about it
8512508 none of us know the reason why but for example this morning i took a girl for a test in chester because shed failed twice in mold and she sailed through
8512509 we zijn hier maar een dagje en op zondag zijn we alweer thuis
8512510 de kerk vind ik leuk om even te bezoeken maar verder heb ik er niet zo veel mee
8512511 as far as i am aware the university plans to make two academic staff redundant at the meeting
8512512 if either of staff are made redundant we will ballot staff for strike action on 26 september
8512513 the university authorities have made a bit of a mess of this thats why the hefcw got its consultants involved
8512514 having created a mess in the first place they risk causing further damage by making people redundant what sort of signal does this send out to potential students and staff
8512515 we continue to act in the collective best interests of the university of wales lampeter uwl to safeguard its short and long term financial viability
8512516 as a result we are facing some very difficult economic decisions
8512517 we are disappointed with the university and college unions ongoing refusal to enter into constructive negotiations with us and with their intended ballot for strike action which only serves to potentially damage the reputation of uwl
8512518 when you look at it under a microscope its very concentrated very mobile and now weve had great success with the first two attempts two ais and two pregnancies thats the proof of the pudding
8512519 everyone thought oh thats so cute it just makes it real it just shows life and its really nice to see the calf moving around
8512520 this is the first pregnancy at the zoo its not just the first birth we have to manage the pregnancy manage the birth shes a first time mum
8512521 shes certainly a bit more clingy than usual id say when we come out in the paddock we do spend quite a bit of time with the elephants here and its not unusual for her just to follow you round the paddock
8512522 prehistoric objects have in a way become creative playthings over the last three years
8512523 working with the team in the museum weve done some extraordinary things with them though with the greatest care and respect of course
8512524 to be able to use them through the medium of animation within the landscape and amongst the monuments from which they came and with the people of the isle of anglesey seems extraordinarily powerful
8512525 this is as far as im aware completely unique a first for wales
8512526 the legacy of the islands extraordinary heritage lies in a rich array of prehistoric monuments and objects spanning at least 5 000 years of history

8512529 a man of trained mind knowing that god must not be represented as a physical entity in space would say god is everywhere and not merely in heaven but if the omnipresence of god be taken only in a physical and special sense that formula too is likely in error
8512530 accordingly the philosopher more adequately expresses the purely spiritual nature of god when he asserts that god is nowhere but in himself in fact rather than say that god is in space he might more justly say that space and matter are in god
8512531 what can i do to another that i do not also do unto god or myself
8512532 finally a church where i can believe whatever i want
8512533 by voting they have ensured that tiger airways gives our customers the route network they want
8512534 traditionally many of the people of south australia who have wanted to join an airline as a flight attendant have had to pursue their career interstate due to limited opportunities
8512535 this is such an exciting opportunity for some enthusiastic and energetic people to spread their wings and join our team without having to leave home
8512536 today when finally we get a chance to vote down this legislation mr iemma takes it off the table
8512537 if ever you need an example of a bloke whose not in control either of his government or his party its what happened now
8512538 michael costa has condemned his privatisation to a cowards death
8512539 the community will be furious that the iemma government has squandered their money on a parliamentary recall that achieved nothing
8512540 its on for young and old so bring it on
8512541 im not a seat warmer i dont sit around because im unemployable to pick up a salary at the public expense
8512542 im here because there are things to be done and if these things are not to be undertaken im not just talking about electricity but other reforms certainly there is no role for me in the nsw parliament
8512543 immerse yourself in literature and poetry meet pulitzer prize winners and probe the writers mind or you can dress silly sing loud laugh a lot and have the cheapest possible family outing
8512544 the lack of security precautions taken to secure important data is shocking there needs to be accountability and processes in place to ensure that data taken from a company whether it is on a laptop pda or usb stick is secured in such a way that there is no risk of it getting into the wrong hands
8512545 encryption isnt enough it is a blend of security that will keep data safe it is all encompassing from allowing only authorised staff to access the files on the network to password protection to encryption to tracking and recovery software
8512546 its not a frequent occurrence but this isnt the first time

8512557 algae biodiesel isnt practical yet but startups and giants are enthusiastically exploring the possibilities
8512558 the potential to deliver 10 or 100 times more energy per acre
8512559 in the past two years we have changed from algae skeptics to proponents
8512560 we are very pleased that our strategic partner merck has chosen to initiate a further phase ii clinical trial we look forward to continued progress of the program building on clinical data obtained so far

8512563 it couldnt have been any worse the first two games but weve got to come back tomorrow
8512564 when i walked into this clubhouse i remembered getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away and i got a smile on my face because it just has a good memory to me
8512565 and i know this is the last year of the stadium so you think about that
8512566 two games doesnt make a lifetime it doesnt make a career
8512567 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankee series for me
8512568 im not writing a hall of fame career just yet but its been nice to get off to the start ive gotten off to it takes a little bit of pressure off

8512573 brought them to adam to see what he would call them
8512574 the man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of the air and to every animal of the field

8512577 its just a reminder that we live in a very active area and that immediately west of vancouver island is where new ocean crust is being born and where we would call a very active geological environment

8512597 of course a lot of players in that league are going to be trying out for the team
8512598 maha suci tuhan yang telah menciptakan pasangan pasangan semuanya baik dari apa yang ditumbuhkan oleh bumi dan dari diri mereka maupun dari apa yang tidak mereka ketahui
8512599 hai manusia sesungguhnya kami menciptakan kamu dari seorang laki laki dan seorang perempuan dan menjadikan kamu berbangsa bangsa dan bersuku suku supaya kamu saling kenal mengenal sesungguhnya orang yang paling mulia di antara kamu di sisi allah ialah orang yang paling bertakwa di antara kamu sesungguhnya allah maha mengetahui lagi maha mengenal
8512600 dan janganlah kamu mendekati zina sesungguhnya zina itu adalah suatu perbuatan yang keji dan suatu jalan yang buruk
8512601 sesungguhnya allah taala telah menetapkan nasib anak adam mengenai zina
8512602 wanita wanita yang keji adalah untuk laki laki yang keji dan laki laki yang keji adalah buat wanita wanita yang keji pula dan wanita wanita yang baik adalah untuk laki laki yang baik dan laki laki yang baik adalah untuk wanita wanita yang baik pula
8512603 dan setan menjadikan mereka memandang baik perbuatan perbuatan mereka lalu ia menghalangi mereka dari jalan allah sedangkan mereka adalah orang orang yang berpandangan tajam
8512604 dan jika kamu ditimpa sesuatu godaan setan maka berlindunglah kepada allah sesungguhnya allah maha mendengar lagi maha mengetahui
8512605 hai orang orang yang beriman taatlah kepada allah dan rasul nya dan janganlah kamu berpaling daripada nya sedang kamu mendengar perintah perintah nya 20 dan janganlah kamu menjadi sebagai orang orang munafik yang berkata
8512606 kecelakaan yang besarlah bagi tiap tiap orang yang banyak berdusta lagi banyak berdosa 7 dia mendengar ayat ayat allah dibacakan kepadanya kemudian dia tetap menyombongkan diri seakan akan dia tidak mendengarnya
8512607 sesungguhnya orang orang yang kafir kepada allah dan rasu rasul nya dan bermaksud memperbedakan antara keimanan kepada allah dan rasul rasul nya dengan mengatakan
8512608 maka pernahkah kamu melihat orang yang menjadikan hawa nafsunya sebagai tuhannya dan allah membiarkannya sesat berdasarkan ilmu nya dan allah telah mengunci mati pendengaran dan hatinya dan meletakkan tutupan atas penglihatannya maka siapakah yang akan memberinya petunjuk sesudah allah membiarkannya sesat maka mengapa kamu tidak mengambil pelajaran
8512609 boleh jadi kamu membenci sesuatu padahal ia amat baik bagimu dan boleh jadi pula kamu menyukai sesuatu padahal ia amat buruk bagimu allah mengetahui sedang kamu tidak mengetahui
8512610 im sorry youre on a budget plan the rate you pay is actually considered to be low
8512611 but i cant imagine that this is the first time in history that these creative type endeavors are evolving from a piece of literature
8512612 it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
8512613 we would have an immigration policy that brings 12 million people out of the shadows
8512614 we all know our countrys journey toward equality isnt finished yet we have more work to do
8512615 hes our story he has walked in our shoes and he has walked our mile
8512616 we are preparing and giving our soldiers and airmen a heads up
8512617 unfortunately weve had a lot of practice katrina and rita and dolly recently have given us ample opportunity to hone our skills
8512618 not sure if this is or is not the norm but i just received my brand new iphone here in the uk and once it had been activated on itunes i found that the home screen the screen you can personalise with a photo already had a photo set against it
8512619 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this
8512620 i think its a kind of personal touch its nice maybe every phone that gets a full quality test should have its testers picture taken and left on there and the working conditions look pretty good
8512621 they have coldhearted demounted their chancellor cheated their voters several times and creep on the dusty floor to receive a good press in austrias most popular newspaper
8512622 the only one who makes me both breathless and speechless
8512623 the last person who tried to negotiate didnt do very well
8512624 well have a devil of a time getting joris out of here before the other giants show up

8512633 but not before he paid us a handsome tribute have you any tribute for mighty rognvald little pinkskin

8512635 are you collecting figurines oh mighty rognvald a pursuit for old ladies i believe
8512636 dont dare to tell me my business skald one gift does not make a collection
8512637 i beg your pardon mighty rognvald it hardly seems like tribute worthy of such a mighty warrior
8512638 truly it is little enough when comapred with the likes of this
8512639 a fine prize for the jarl she will reward me twice over for this
8512640 your lady jarl needs adornments worthy of her station this i can see
8512641 and i happen to know a collector of such figurines who would offer me a fine price indeed
8512642 let us offer you a better tribute for your lady and take this awkward chunk of rock off your hands you will be spared the trouble of dealing with it yea your renown can only grow as you tell the tale of how you made foolish travelers carry the useless thing away
8512643 hell turn on us as soon as we pay him
8512644 but ill bet that haden is a good deal more convincing than your wizard
8512645 very well wee skald i accept your tribute take the statue and begone but if you pass this way again i expect a share of your profits from the statue
8512646 truly rognvald is magnanimous beyond measure i will spread word of his fame throughout the land
8512647 everyone grab the statue and lets see if wee can actually move it
8512648 i could teleport now back to silverymoon i mean then i can get a scroll to fix his condition
8512649 we suspect that bdnf has important issues in many parts of the brain including memory and ability to sense pain

8512651 we are constantly talking to the attorney generals office and the governor and the prosecutor
8512652 there is no deal we are working to prepare for trial
8512653 under the michigan election law for elected city officers if the governor determines that there is sufficient evidence to warrant removal from office the law requires the governor to remove the officer
8512654 there is no ideological divide russia is still a nuclear power and its highly unlikely that washington would risk a major conflict
8512655 russia relies on the global economic community much more than it did in the past
8512656 how can russia square that with a kind of cold war policy
8512657 they lost the cold war because of the incredible damage it caused to their economy and oil and gas isnt going to be the final answer in bringing their economy to the level they hope it can reach
8512658 when you see that since the start of the georgia conflict between 15 and 20 billion euros 25 billion and 35 billion have left the country because confidence in the stable development of russia has vanished that adds up to immense damage to the russian economy
8512659 what we are seeing is russia wanting to be taken seriously as a global power and its reaction to what it sees is western encroachment on its sphere of influence
8512660 the risk of a military escalation evolving is really low neither russia nor the west would want to get involved neither side wants a downturn in relations
8512661 to the us and the eu it is a shock the way russia has responded there is a realisation in the west that russia has changed
8512662 i prefer that the russians suspend cooperation rather than the allies because it demonstrates that we are respecting the law
8512663 the danger is that we might quickly demolish something their ties that has taken a very long time to build
8512664 confidence is built up over years and can be destroyed in a few days
8512665 russia is isolated i cant see an alliance forming to stand against nato
8512666 while most americans were struggling the good times were rolling for the top 10
8512667 when income concentration creates barriers to the resources and opportunities that would enable people to get ahead on their own initiative and efforts that violates our fundamental sense of fairness

8512675 consisting of new commissions and recent works by nine leading contemporary artists the invited artists were presented with over 40 acres of some of the most beautiful landscape in the country to respond to
8512676 we found that people in charge of human resource affairs were not aware of the provisions of the act and surprisingly this included public corporations
8512677 we intensified the inspection visits and if there were gaps between the service conditions actually practised by the enterprises and that required by the act we asked them to rectify as per the act
8512678 wed warned agencies that there would be follow up visits and that they would be penalized if the act was not complied with
8512679 the latest attack was in july when our healthy choni name of a calf was killed by wild dogs
8512680 the wild dogs usually attack the eyes and the rear of calves first they hunt during the day in packs of 10 to 12 dogs
8512681 mithuns are semi wild animals and they have to graze freely

8512689 that by working together we helped to make our country more just thats what i hope but i believe that at least it will be said that we tried
8512690 the fact in issue was that the accused distributed to participants of the conference of international participants copies of his petition to his majesty the king
8512691 the petition contained scurrilous and malignant statements against the government
8512692 a long as the extended areas are not opened to development land values will soar
8512693 if the entire local area plan opens up simultaneously the rate will come down
8512694 most of the local area plans lap are not yet released once the laps are released therell be more transactions which will stabilise prices
8512695 once government introduces the vacant land tax it will encourage transaction which in turn would stabilise prices
8512696 there is no land available in the core city therefore the rush is towards the outskirts
8512697 value of land is inflated when its mortgaged with banks because it is considered the best asset now
8512698 if returns from land are low land will become a liability rather than an asset
8512699 many people borrow 100 percent from the banks and invest in land and construction
8512700 but more people are finding it difficult to buy land construct houses and repay loans once more people come into the land and construction business it will stabilise
8512701 i assumed that i received the exact amount without checking

8512719 what we saw was a significant reduction in the amount of censorship in beijing while we were still able to find proxy servers to do our probes from within beijing
8512720 one thing we saw during the olympics they are using key words that are specific to current events to stop reports of those current events
8512721 while that was happening we actually witnessed her name being on the blacklist the key words that they blacklist
8512722 my guess would be that they cared more about protests at the olympics
8512723 i think they just targeted their censorship more specifically at protests during the olympics to make sure the olympics went off smoothly

8512740 the gap between us and the eu is big so there is plenty of room for investment in the long term it will benefit the economy and the currency
8512741 investment into renewables is one of the strategic measures we are taking to respond to the adopted energy climactic package of the eu
8512742 there has been growing interest from investors to build wind power plants in romania over the last year
8512743 the investment announced by ez is the most important one in the field so far
8512744 i think there will be pressure on saudi arabia to rein in some of its recent unilateral increases
8512745 it all depends on what level of prices saudi arabia wants to see
8512746 it would be politically difficult for opec to push through anything formal
8512747 but that does not rule out them trimming physical supply
8512748 its no surprise these suggestions are coming from venezuela and iran
8512749 they are countries with desperate need for oil revenues and im sure theyve got used to the revenues they were getting at 145 a barrel
8512750 the recent increase in production from saudi arabia was not well received by some of the more hawkish members of opec though it really just offset contractions in supply in non opec countries in the h1 of 2008
8512751 we also welcome the decision to avoid new changes in vat which in our view would create new distortions and undermine again the mnbs task to bring inflation back to target within a reasonable horizon
8512752 history tells us that governments that have built on this extra tax revenues from the withening of the economy too much found that these effects take some time they exist in theory but in practice it is usually quite difficult
8512753 are fine unfortunately however they have to reduce the deficit further and without having an offsetting measure i e a vat increase and hoping to finance it only from higher tax revenues that seems to be a little bit of a risk
8512754 we do not expect incomes from whitening coming in anywhere near the targets in an optimistic case this will suffocate the gyurcs ny 2 package before its complete implementation while in a pessimistic scenario it will derail the convergence program
8512755 yes we will be active in norways 20th licensing round

8512792 the pfa who represent james milner are disappointed that information regarding his request for a move and the circumstances surrounding it have come to the publics attention and we feel we have no option but to respond
8512793 the facts are that james transfer request was actually handed in on wednesday august 20 at which point it was asked by newcastle to keep the matter private
8512794 the request was given because the player was looking for an improvement on his contract that reflected his development and his value to the club
8512795 to clarify the situation james did sign a contract 12 months ago however this agreement was reached with the club nearly 12 months previous at the point at which newcastle had agreed to sell james to aston villa on transfer deadline day 2006 before cancelling the agreement at the 11th hour
8512796 since then he has played over 80 games for newcastle all james wanted was a deal that reflected his development and that was in line with newcastles transfer valuation of him
8512797 whilst james does have three years left on his current agreement it is common practice that when a young player signs a long term contract this is reviewed and improved on a regular basis with a players development but equally it protects the clubs position in regard to their transfer value
8512798 although the transfer request was handed in seven days ago james has been professional in keeping the matter private whilst giving strong performances for newcastle
8512799 i noticed the difference from the first moment we turned up in scotland and did a fielding drill and straight away i noticed it was different
8512800 the energy the buzz the skill levels and the fitness of the guys was different which is not saying it was bad when i was in the squad before but there has been an increase in intensity definitely and its fantastic
8512801 i dont think it happens overnight but its down to a lot of hard work i havent been here for a while so i dont know what the talk has been like behind closed doors but i imagine the difference is down to hard work
8512802 its something i have always believed in that the harder you work in the end you will get what you deserve but its not just about hard work its about being clever with it working on specific skills that might make the difference in the game like hitting the stumps and things like that
8512803 having worked with peter at sussex he is very keen on making sure were fit energetic and are getting our skill levels up
8512804 the team also has to buy into it so the individuals also have to think this is going to make a difference and make us better its a team effort to make those decisions and get better
8512805 the message will be weve done nothing yet and thats quite important
8512806 its been a good two games but lets make it three lets be really consistent and put in another really good performance
8512807 we want to play with the best and to do that we had to qualify for the group stage it was a big mental test
8512808 the whole team was sharper and physically much better than on saturday and that is why it made it easier
8512809 he brings calm and confidence to the side and overall we had a good balance in the side
8512810 cesc could have stayed on he always wants to play but he was probably more disappointed that they did not have a go at us
8512811 i have always said we have to be patient with him
8512812 i felt he can be decisive in any game against anybody if we can get him in
8512813 he has improved his first touch and his link up play which was vital for his progression
8512814 but the way he finished his goal you cannot teach that he has that naturally
8512815 you can see many transfers announced in the media every day but it takes a lot of time and does not always happen
8512816 i was sat here yesterday and they were talking about a crisis at arsenal someone said it was the best time to play them after they lost to fulham but it was the worst time
8512817 we are hurt and disappointed its not how we expect twente to play we must take that anger into saturdays match when the season starts
8512818 arsenal are further on than us they have played premier league games and it showed they were fitter and stronger than they were two weeks ago
8512819 we played with belief and competed with them in the first leg we didnt do that today
8512820 its been a great experience for the players they are a young team and they need these experiences to learn
8512821 we are in the uefa cup the season starts on saturday and there is still a lot to play for
8512822 in de namiddag was er boven ons flink geruzie mijn man is gaan aankloppen en heeft gevraagd om wat stiller te zijn voor alle zekerheid heeft hij mij gevraagd om de politie te bellen
8512823 een ploeg was heel snel hier en heeft de huurder en zijn vriend gevraagd om wat stiller te zijn de twee zeiden tegen de agenten dat ze dronken waren dat ze hun roes zouden uitslapen en voor geen problemen meer zouden zorgen na een tiental minuten keerde de rust inderdaad terug we dachten dat ze effectief in slaap waren gevallen tot mijn dochter binnenkwam en vertelde dat ze onze huurder op straat was tegengekomen en dat hij vol bloed hing toen is mijn man terug naar de flat gegaan en heeft hij een man gevonden halfdood geslagen zo leek het wel

8512828 we decided that steven would play through the pain against liege and then have the operation he may not be fit for the manchester united game but he certainly will be okay for the first group stage match next month
8512829 he has a groin problem so he will have an operation and could be out for 10 to 15 days it is not serious but we need to do it now
8512830 he has been playing some games in pain not being 100 fit and we decided that this was the best moment for the operation
8512831 he had a problem for the first game with liege and also when he went away to play for england in their friendly last week against the czech republic
8512832 we talked with the doctor yesterday and today and it was decided that steven would play in this match with the pain but now we will have to get the situation solved
8512833 i was delighted with dirk kuyt his goal was a reward for all the effort he puts in for us he is amazing
8512834 his work is tremendous he keeps going right to the end and makes a tremendous contribution to our side
8512835 obviously there is some relief with the result we knew it would be a difficult game against a quick well organised team
8512836 the positive was that we played a little better than recently we want to win trophies but we also understand the need for money
8512837 we are very sad after that result over two matches we have been the best organised team and we deserved better than to lose like that in the final minutes
8512838 we have produced a high standard in both matches and now i hope that can be continued in our league matches and the uefa cup
8512839 i sometimes wondered whether the referee was affected by the fact that we were playing a big team i felt we should have had a couple of penalties
8512840 ik vind de juiste woorden niet om te zeggen wat ik voel tony was meer dan een collega hij was ook een vriend en een van de allerfijnste en sportiefste collegas in het circuit daarmee wil ik niet cru zijn tegenover andere collegas maar tony was gewoon heel dienstvaardig als je in de problemen zat kon je altijd op hem rekenen
8512841 we are ever confident that it will get done but we have always said it will go to the wire
8512842 we will keep moving it on and we hope that he will be joining us here at chelsea
8512843 there were two players luiz felipe scolari identified one was deco and one was robinho and we have already seen the impact deco has made on the premier league
8512844 i think the squad is strong and capable of competing in all competitions without robinho but with him it is an added dimension
8512845 robinho continues being a real madrid player and the coach counts on him
8512846 those in charge of the sporting side of things want him to continue and ive always wanted to follow the plans of those who really know about these things
8512847 me going to chelsea im staying as a rossoneri player
8512848 i should help milan to win the trophies were up for this season
8512849 ive always said im happy at milan and as long as my aims remain the same as milans ill stay here until now its always been that way
8512850 my goal is to win milans is too as long as we are like that ill remain at milan
8512851 he wright phillips doesnt want to join either of them and we are now discussing the next move to see what we do
8512852 im disturbed by the fact that people were hurt and someone died as far as my responsibility for that goes it stops there because i know our message is actually very positive

8512860 we zijn ervan overtuigd dat we het evenwicht tussen omzetgroei en marge zullen bewaren

8512863 the main purpose of our visit to his excellency kagame was basically you know he is the chair of the east african community so we had to come and brief him about what programs and projects well be undertaking during the next one year
8512864 we were able to exchange views about various areas to see where he would want to put more emphasis for us to implement
8512865 you know there are issues about the power master plan the road network there is going to be quite a lot of activity going on during the next one year but we also discussed issues about how we can promote tourism as one region
8512866 things such as roadblocks working time opening border posts and so on need very little financial capability to remove

8512896 a series of events are coming together to create perhaps not a perfect storm but certainly in climate weather for barack obama given that he hoped to capture lightening in a bottle with a rhetorical whirlwind thursday night at invesco stadium
8512897 hillary clinton who endorsed an agenda last night in denver which included at least slight personal praise for john mccain yet yielded no such thing for barack obama the second big wave to crash into him is coming tomorrow with hillarys even if sometimes inappropriately engorged lessor half
8512898 if i might slip my metaphor here one almost senses john mccain and to some extent the clintons are playing chess while obama is left to play checkers jumping up on to a podium so some number of democrats can crown him king thereby feeding into the very celebrity meme mccain has been beating him up with for weeks and to think this was his big chance to shine all thats needed now is a cloud burst thursday night which if nothing else would at least hide the tears generated as a result

8512906 itu langkah yang salah seharusnya agus si peniup terompet itu justru dilindungi termasuk partainya
8512907 ini justru momen yang bagus untuk pdip dia bisa berkampanye dengan pernyataan agus condro kalau agus condro malah dimusuhi orang orang akan menilai pdip memang sudah terbiasa menerima yang seperti itu

8512929 truthfully it was adams conscience some of the things that had taken placed needed to be disclosed

8512931 when he took money from somebody else illegally he used the money that he took to pay off the earlier loans
8512932 to steal money and then a couple years later say im sorry ill pay it back is still a theft
8512933 hes an exceptionally charming guy and he had a great ability to raise money from anybody
8512934 this research illustrates that while the lower tax rates have not paid for themselves they do provide important economic benefits and can expand the tax base to such an extent that they cost the federal government substantially less revenue than the casual observer might think
8512935 the 2001 and 2003 tax rate reductions an overview and estimate of the taxable income response
8512936 the obama campaign is not taking into consideration any behavioral reaction which means that the revenue gain that obama is predicting from his tax increase is not going to be as large as they say
8512937 the conservative estimate we use for budget purposes comes from the tax policy center and it does take into consideration some elasticity
8512938 even taking the 40 response at face value thats a long way from tax cuts paying for themselves
8512939 that is mccain needs serious spending cuts to pay for his tax cuts and he doesnt have any

8512954 it will be on view much longer than a traditional auction preview is
8512955 but anyone whos thought you know maybe ill get a damien hirst will definitely have the chance to get one from the auction
8512956 so i think it will just bring loads more people in and will just make it you know much more dynamic and exciting
8512957 theres no smarter businessman in the art world than damien hirst
8512958 and i think sothebys is very in touch with damiens market they know how big it is and how broad it is and its not necessarily all reached by his primary dealers

8512963 the issue really becomes more about what should you pay for a damien hirst if im looking at a catalog with 40 butterfly paintings maybe i shouldnt pay 2 million for one maybe i should only pay one million

8512971 i am troubled by what appear to be inconsistencies in the forensic evaluation as compared to statements obtained by the sheriffs department as to the circumstances of the shooting

8512974 having served the past 30 years at the county sheriffs office the last eight of which were as county sheriff i can assure you that it is difficult for me to say goodbye but the time has come for me to close this chapter of my life and open up a new one
8512975 i am especially grateful to all of the officers and staff at the sheriffs department they have stuck by me through thick and thin through tight budgetary times and through many a difficult challenge on the job
8512976 above all else i want to thank the good citizens of columbiana county who have favored me with their vote these past two terms thank you one and all
8512977 a cohesive effective and well trained department that is fair and impartial yet tough on crime
8512978 the most extensive law enforcement experience but the right temperament the right independence and the high level of personal integrity warranted for such an important post as county sheriff

8512983 i think through the parks board and you guys things can happen
8512984 they were willing to go somewhere other than the parks now maybe theyre seeing the light that it may have to be somewhere other that the parks existing the fact its somewhere other that the parks its still a parks project

8513014 the policies say everything is open but the practice becomes a little different
8513015 the proprietary software vendors have been very successful in convincing people in procurement whether in government or the private sector that software is a product and you buy it like you do an automobile

8513030 we have been unhappy with microsoft for some time before the release of exchange 2007 which included voip voice over internet protocol in its unified messaging suite it was time to offer our customers an alternative
8513031 if you think about what were going to do we usually acquire when we move into new markets that we do not have the expertise for the product segments in
8513032 once again cisco makes a sound investment in an email technology vendor just like it did with
8513033 these are the clever guys who reverse engineered the exchange client protocol mapi rpc and the related on the wire details needed to make a vanilla install of outlook talk to a non exchange mail server with full fidelity impressive stuff of all the other exchange alternatives postpath has the most interesting architecture and i say that as one who has years emotionally invested in the openmail technology
8513034 i think cisco fell out of love with microsoft a while back something to do with voip support in exchange and how cisco thought it was microsofts partner but it turned out that microsoft was competing with them nothing familiar there at all
8513035 sounds like cisco wants to offer saas collaboration based on postpath and webex whoever said the email world has become dull and uninteresting

8513066 our situation has been improving and we are making a profit this year
8513067 i dont think that the classic economic theories work in here as we have a large labor market next to us finland or sweden or some go to ireland and england its not likely that the unemployment would grow significantly but that means that people are leaving
8513068 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8513069 therefore it is possible that real growth will be negative this year
8513070 the quality of household loans started to deteriorate in the second half of last year at first owing to the deteriorating quality of consumer credit
8513071 the share of overdue household loans started to grow faster in may 2008 but the quality of housing loans is not so poor yet as to pose a threat to financial stability
8513072 keeping income and expenditure in balance is a reasonable compromise against the backdrop of the uncertain global economic outlook and provides a good basis for passing over to a sustainable expenditure growth pace still leaving enough space for dealing with unexpected events

8513084 the latvian economy grew by just 0 2 year on year in q2 this appears consistent with a contraction in seasonally adjusted gdp of 1 5 the first quarterly fall since 1998 but its only a matter of time before latvia joins estonia in recession
8513085 the r8 is the first production audi bearing the name and genes of a successful racing sportscar and is therefore an excellent base from which to build up our first big customer sport program

8513091 a big mug of coffee zoning out for about 30 minutes or so and then filling out my tps reports
8513092 i know hes a millionaire and hes got the funds
8513093 these two are getting nearly nude to protest the over packaging of products

8513095 you can come here and buy your soap naked your shampoo naked we have solid shampoo solid bubble bath you can spend extra on packaging but why
8513096 it was going to be just aprons originally the natick police came and they just informed us that there would be arrests made if we didnt wear briefs
8513097 they had a discussion with them and i understand the management had a change of plan
8513098 possible violations run a broad spectrum it could go from disorderly conduct to indecent exposure to open and gross lewdness
8513099 i decided i would support them clothed instead although they look good naked
8513100 it wasnt because of the police it was just a personal decision i made
8513101 we came down because we love lush and we read about the event in the metrowest news
8513102 we are green people we try to be green and we just thought this was something to alert the world about and massachusetts and natick especially
8513103 im a nurse so i see nudity all the time
8513104 the human body is about as generic an item as you can imagine because everyone has got one
8513105 i didnt know what they would do they said they would do something cool that would get the police to come
8513106 it represents significant potential for annual fuel savings of almost 700 million gallons of gasoline and over 6 million tons per year of potential greenhouse gasses that could be eliminated

8513109 trench art is art forged in fire blood and destruction to honor the courage duty and sacrifice of those who would possess it
8513110 thats the first time i ever saw anything like that in person
8513111 the thing that really struck me was the crucifix made out of bayonets
8513112 my god was i surprised by the quality of the stuff
8513113 you can imagine how conflicted the person who made this must have been to make a religious object from a bayonet
8513114 i really enjoyed harvells show id never thought so many of the things from the war would now be considered a form of trench art

8513119 we are united in our view that her actions over the last two weeks have been damaging not just to international stability but also to the respect with which russia and the trust that russia holds around the world
8513120 we both want to defend international rules that respect the sovereignty the integrity and the democracy of nation states
8513121 exercise goalkeeper provides coalition and regional navies an opportunity to fine tune their skills in conducting essential maritime security operations
8513122 that young democracy has been subjected to an unjustified assault and the international community has joined in condemning russias invasion of a sovereign democratic neighbor and its recognition of georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
8513123 were going to keep our commitments to afghanistan and iraq as we have pledged to do
8513124 for the sake of our freedom and security we must not relent until this enemy is destroyed
8513125 were gathering better intelligence because now the iraqis are less afraid to pass along tips about where enemy fighters are hiding and where they keep their weapons
8513126 is substantially degraded running out of sanctuaries losing the fight
8513127 has given iraqs elected leaders the breathing room to pass new reforms and theyve stepped up to their responsibilities
8513128 are able to lead more and more operations on their own
8513129 weve brought home all five of the combat brigades and the three marine units who were sent into iraq as part of the surge
8513130 further troop movements will as always depend on what is happening on the ground
8513131 ive had no greater privilege than the chance to work with members of the american armed forces
8513132 i believe that if anyone lacks for inspiration in the war on terror they need look no farther than the men and women who do the fighting
8513133 whether its on cold mountain peaks in afghanistan or the hot dusty streets of iraq they have been magnificent
8513134 and a new generation of warriors is the next chapter of american ingenuity bravery and valor
8513135 we have served those principles and sacrificed for them to the far corners of the earth
8513136 we have thrown back tyrants stood watch on the frontiers of freedom and defended the weak against the violent
8513137 weve done all this not for glory or empire but for freedom because we know that the spread of freedom makes our world safer and brings us closer to the peace we all desire
8513138 in the process weve received more than our share of criticism and we can take it
8513139 is a better place because of the power the influence and the values of the united states of america
8513140 the crew of dallas really wants these goods to make a difference in the lives of the georgian people
8513141 when we received the order to deliver these supplies the men and women of this ship responded quickly at every turn
8513142 we could see a serious strengthening of nato actually performing its core mission of standing against the russians and trying to roll back russian influence in the former cis thats going to be the main issue
8513143 the worst scenario for the russian ruling elite is the introduction of western principles of responsible government fair elections and rule of law and so on which will actually undermine the position of our corrupt elite and they dont want that
8513144 they were very much frightened by the so called colored revolutions democratic revolutions in georgia and in ukraine in 03 and 04
8513145 and that is well understood here russia so there is more talk aimed at western public opinion to frighten people who would agree ok we can give away georgia we dont know nothing much about georgia its far off let the russians have georgia if that can help avoid a world war so i believe this is basically propaganda aimed at western public opinion
8513146 indaade is a member of al shabab the one who has taken over kismayo and is the most powerful person
8513147 so they are working together now they see one way of getting money for terrorist activities is through gun running and drug trafficking
8513148 or maybe al shabab is using him because he has fire power and heavy military equipment
8513149 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
8513150 anbar remains a dangerous place but the ever growing ability of the iraqi security forces continues to move us closer to seeing iraqi control of the province
8513151 the force we needed in the anbar province in 2005 2006 to fight the insurgent at its height is not the force that we need there now to do nation building and to try to bring the government and the sunnis closer together
8513152 are doing a very good job of this nation building business
8513153 its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be
8513154 the taliban are growing bolder in their tactics and clearly doing their best to exploit security gaps where they exist
8513155 everyone seems to agree that additional forces are the ideal course of action for preventing a taliban comeback but just where theyre going to come from is still up for discussion
8513156 i think michelle obama kicked it off pretty well dont you think
8513157 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house down last night
8513158 the whole biden family on this journey with me to take america back
8513159 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the effort to take america back
8513160 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8513161 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8513162 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8513163 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8513164 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8513165 i was saying to my coach can you imagine if this happened during the match
8513166 i just realize i had to go more to the forehand because backhand she was making good shots
8513167 it kind of made me go outside of the court and defend
8513168 i think its very interesting for everybody because its very unpredictable
8513169 guns n roses representatives have been made aware of the arrest and are leaving the matter to the authorities
8513170 certain recent events have shown how dangerous the conflict potential in some frozen conflicts as theyre commonly called can be
8513171 this became particularly apparent in south ossetia where as a result of aggressive actions after georgias leadership had basically gone crazy all those problems became exacerbated and essentially an armed conflict took place this is a very serious warning to everybody and i think we should consider other existing problems in this context now
8513172 most people in transdniester think that since the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia was recognized transdniester can expect the same but the situation is completely different
8513173 relations between moldova and transdniester lack the ethnic element characteristic of the georgian south ossetian abkhaz conflict more importantly transdniester doesnt have the trump card that abkhazia and south ossetia had a common border with the russian federation
8513174 i think russia is capable of repeating this aggression against azerbaijan by using the conflict in nagorno karabakh
8513175 its russia that occupies 20 percent of azerbaijani territory under armenias flag its russia that hampers any step toward a resolution russia doesnt want this conflict to be settled because it needs this conflict to harass azerbaijan to get azerbaijan back into the russian empire
8513176 i think it would actually show them how dangerous it would be to start a war in the caucasus the amount of destruction that can be caused and how dangerous that could be for azerbaijan
8513177 it will complicate the karabakh peace process because of the fact that the russians and the americans are two out of three mediators
8513178 russia and the united states have managed to cooperate quite well in the minsk group up until now on karabakh but i think the u s russian relationship is now so bad in the caucasus that it will be hard for them to trust each other as they have in the past in the minsk group
8513179 it has shown that having monitors on the ground means very little if one of the two sides or both the sides want to fight
8513180 the osce monitors in south ossetia were completely irrelevant just as the un was in abkhazia when the abkhaz wanted to retake the kodori gorge they just basically told the united nations were going in and youd better get out
8513181 must buy it now all of it now and it must be the absolute top of the line item
8513182 as well as an added 1gb of internal memory which canon claims is a first for a compact photo printer
8513183 we dont forecast the ports our ships are going to be pulling into
8513184 the ships are performing duties on maintaining peace and stability in abkhazia and in the republics territorial waters
8513185 among the duties we are performing is control over abkhazias territorial waters and the prevention of the trafficking in arms we are also carrying out a humanitarian mission
8513186 jackson hattiesburg laurel and all areas along the coast its a little mexico
8513187 im not against people trying to make living i have a compassion for those folks but at the same time the taxpayers of mississippi shouldnt be subsidizing a plant that wont even hire their own workers
8513188 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8513189 the union uses the tactic of saying immigration was coming and the members of the union would not be taken
8513190 i need a job and got kids i heard that they need some help now
8513191 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs
8513192 that doesnt justify but it certainly explains why they might be hiring individuals who show up and say ill work for you
8513193 we categorically deny that the sudan liberation movement has carried out the hijacking
8513194 we condemn any act that causes harm to any sudanese civilian
8513195 not say anything now but we are considering everything so that the passengers the 100 passengers are protected

8513242 hes not shy hes not one to sit back he makes things happen
8513243 at first it was spooky but from talking to him id be really lucky to do half of what o j has been able to accomplish in his lifetime
8513244 following in his footsteps is something that im focused on and i really would like to do everyone ive met has been able to tell me how hes had some type impact on their life thats something that he has that i wish i could do have a lasting impact on people

8513247 r c slocum hired me took a chance on me a long time ago a lot of my philosophy on coaching raising my kids living my life was formulated here while i was at college station whether it was in a staff meeting with r c or meeting with aggies going to the churches going to the schools
8513248 so a lot of who i am as a man forget coaching was formulated here at a amp m ive never forgotten that and now to come back full circle at this point in my life is very unique in many ways but also very gratifying
8513249 first of all hes a great football coach and hes an even better person
8513250 and mike sherman knows texas a amp m he knows the former players he knows the alumni he knows the tradition e slps what the school stands for
8513251 the deal with a amp m it was not college versus the nfl it was a amp m versus any other place i wanted to go someplace i knew i could win
8513252 there are so many unknowns about so many places out there but i knew a amp m what it was about what the heartbeat is here i know the recruiting base i know the high school coaches i know the structure here i felt like without a doubt i could sell in a living room to an 18 year old and his parents
8513253 i just felt like this presented a great opportunity for me to be successful
8513254 he knows whats near and dear to the hearts of texas a amp m aggies
8513255 mike understands the culture and the values we have here hes just terrific i really like this guy

8513263 if due to some righteous activities which provoke devotional service one is influenced by the service attitude and takes shelter of the good association of pure devotees he develops attachment for hearing and chanting by developing chanting and hearing one can advance further and further in regulative devotional service to the supreme lord as one so advances his misgivings about devotional service and his attraction for the material world proportionately diminish by advancing in hearing and chanting a devotee becomes more firmly fixed in his faith and gradually his initial faith develops into a taste for devotional service and that taste gradually develops into attachment when attachment becomes pure it exhibits the two characteristics of increases it is called love of godhead and love of godhead is the ultimate goal of human life
8513264 junior year in high school i think we had just overall one of the best teams thats ever come through mechanicsburg school in a while
8513265 it kind of breaks down to there were no cliques everyone was hanging out with one another on and off the field and then when we were on the field we just knew what everyone was doing i had a great bunch of receivers a great line and everything like that so it worked out
8513266 it was a little disappointing but i still had fun
8513267 so what we didnt have as much talent as we did the previous year but everyone was still putting in the same amount of effort and more
8513268 at the time it looked like a great opening i mean brady quinn was leaving and i was thinking hey ive got a shot go in redshirt for a year sit behind quinn and learn from him and then in the fall i would get in there that was my mindset going in
8513269 at the time it was because it had great facilities great coaches everything like that but at the same time im only 17 still young not really knowing whats going on im not really seeing the big picture im just seeing notre dame wow ive got to go there
8513270 i think you just get caught up in the whole recruiting mess and thats why you commit early even though you dont really have to
8513271 everyone was shooting for that spot because with quinn leaving everyone knew it was open and with clausen coming in everyone was hyped about him and everything like that
8513272 you could definitely feel the tension between everyone because we all were very competitive but i really i stay laid back in situations like that its just my personality
8513273 i didnt think he weis would say what he did but then again hes the coach its his team and thats what he wanted so i took it how it was and i moved on i said hey im going to try and make the best out of my life so thats what i did and thats when i decided to transfer
8513274 we were very pleased that when zach decided to leave notre dame that we were going to be a school he was going to consider
8513275 and we knew him from high school we recruited him out of high school and really liked what we saw and then knowing we had another opportunity at him excited us and were very glad that we landed him
8513276 i actually used to recruit the harrisburg area of pennsylvania a lot so id been to his high school many times and i knew his high school coach very well
8513277 i knew zach back when he was in high school and i knew a bunch of coaches in the league that respected him not just as a player but as a person i knew what kind of guy we were getting
8513278 i feel like im still playing for mechanicsburg just that type of feel thats what you need so were all laughing i mean you see it were all laughing and everyones a team
8513279 i knew it was going to happen but it was just like no i cant sit out another year
8513280 but you know i tried to take it as a kind of helping myself produce and helping myself learn the offense better here
8513281 right now tyler lorenzen is our starting quarterback but zach is the backup and zach knows that in one play he might have to go in and play
8513282 im hoping that hell be able to play because hes the backup and id like to develop another quarterback and develop him and get him in there to get some reps so right now well see how everything goes but if he continues to progress and if he keeps doing the things that we tell him he should do i think hell get his chance to get some playing time this year
8513283 its a dream come true coming out of high school you want to go to college you want to play ball and then in the future you want to make it to the nfl but right now im working on playing in college and i cant wait for that
8513284 and love true love unconditional love cannot be grasped as yet on your planet by most of you it can be imagined but not truly acquired because the third dimension the dimension ninety percent of humankind exist within is a conditional dimension
8513285 excerpted from the earth keeper chronicles june 2008 archangel metatron via james tyberonn sexuality is another area that is very complex very confusing for many of you throughout the eons of time there have been many systems of belief many varied expressions experiments and modalities within the various cultures across the planet on sexual expression within biology some were very inhibited others extremely liberal most human in your present society have conflictory issues about their sexuality and sexual expression it is not ironic that many of you will achieve the highest balance in your lives only after your body ceases to produce sexual hormones yet the release of kundalini of chi through the sexual act is among the most powerful energies available to mankind it has been used for good and has fallen into wasteful misappropriation the key is intent when there is consensual attraction teamed with caring and mutual respect it can be exquisitly sensual beautiful and sacred it is capable of transporting the spirit to higher realms combinining the trinity of body mind and soul when this occurs particularly among members of the same soul guild there is an energy imprint imparted and a synergistic effect that is beneficial on many levels sexuality is the natural expression of love that flowers between souls it can be the highest natural expression of love between people regardless of gender yet it can become a source of guilt a source of control and a source of bias and judgement it can become a source of self aggrandizement and addiction particularly among those of the male gender it is often misunderstood and often misused relationships should be based on agreement and the freedom of this expression should be honored yet optimally aligned with the higher chakras high intent within sexuality is extremely beneficial on all levels physical mental and spiritual it can be a source of rejuvenation and regeneration yet some choose sexual expressions that border on debauchery manipulation greed conquest and misaligned addiction to physical orgasm without judgement we tell you that sexual energy is a gift of exquisite energy and when used in higher intent offers a glimpse into the sacred orgasmic bliss of the celestial realms it is life force and should be used wisely encompassing the body mind and spirit its responsible enfoldment with high intent sharing and love dear ones is another aspect of impeccability oh you say this is so complex of course it is but it is why you are here masters and you can do this with self review and strength of will we are not asking something of you that is beyond your ability we are not asking you to do something that you have no innate understanding of indeed you know these truths already we are revealing what your ego has attempted to hide so what is this we are revealing it is no mystery dear ones it is the crystalline frequency it is the resonance of impeccability it is the mental crystalline resonance and it takes effort it takes will it takes work it takes time and it requires humility masters you are on the cusp of something extraordinary seize the day do not waste precious time do not waste another lifetime you are so close to acquiring a dream that you have sought for many many lifetimes everything you have hidden away everything you have ignored every little obstacle you have put on the back burner will come forward and give you opportunity after opportunity to resolve it it wont go away all unresolved energy must be transmuted before you can step into impeccability and until it is faced it will surface again time after time after time until you confront and dissolve it unresolved energy is that which you have left in chaos in your life and some of you on the cusp of mastery have reorganized these little bits of chaos and repackaged them into tidy little boxes that you have justified in one fashion or another you have justified them disguised them hidden them and spun them into unrecognizable forms that allow you self exoneration thats called denial its called postponement and you put it away to deal with in another lifetime thats called wasting time wasting opportunity the unresolved energy you repel has been polarized and it sits outside your mental field disowned disavowed denied ticking away so you work at maintaining the status quo charging forward some of you on the threshold of mastery think you can move forward irregardless and this dear ones is not the case you may feel saintly because of the many gains you have made and the many issues you have resolved but in most cases the things you have resolved were resolved because they were comparatively easier to handle the ones that were really hard really hidden you havent dealt with you see masters the closer you get to light the stronger you attract the dark it is in a real sense physics electromagnetics pure positive energy has the greatest attraction to negative energy so you must have the wisdom the humility the strength and discipline to deflect it there is another law of physics that you must understand and that is when you achieve the crystalline vibration called impeccability you rise above magnetic duality attraction and enter a field called zero point that is blissful detachment now hard energy hatred and anger is another piece of the puzzle how do you deal with this this isnt a great mystery to you in fact you created it its a part of duality it has two aspects your bible talks of turning the other cheek what does that mean this doesnt mean you apologize when someone steps on your foot part of the paradox is indeed standing up for your truth but it does mean you dont step on the feet of others intentionally or otherwise do you understand aggression is feared by many of you yet in its core aggression is one of the most creative forces on the planet the force that enables a small seed to burst force through the soil and raise its tender green shoot toward the sun and burst into a beautiful flower is pure aggression when human conflict occurs aggression in its pure form is often the means in which humans learn more about themselves we are not referring to a war but rather both parties standing in their truths and finding the means to fully express their views conflicts are often contractual set ups opportunities that teach both parties each of you have an opportunity to stand in impeccability within any conflict you can deal with conflict without engaging it do you understand deal with face it from a stance of emotional detachment as the observer and that is not easy yet it is the way of the master each of you have an opportunity to be impeccable every day the scenario in which you recognize your own failings your own conflict with integrity is the day you encompass impeccability and indeed it is a journey likewise the day you stand in your truth with willingness to recognize another persons truth you encompass integrity there is a saying that the right for a man to swing his fist ends where another mans nose begins impeccability involves recognizing the rights of others without surrendering your own be good to one another measure twice and cut once when you make a mistake own it forgive and be forgiven and do so within detachment there is often the feeling that comes when facing the conflicts and difficulties of life that it is too hard many feel at times that it is just too difficult but masters it is never too hard it is never too difficult the moment you accept your challenges and rise to them in detachment is the moment you achieve clarity of purpose and integrity of clear mind this knowledge this moment of clarity then becomes the power driver of your life irregularity is removed within this detached state of crystalline lucidity you are able and only then able to access the divine mind the multidimensional brain the extraordinary state of clarity that has always been there but never quite accessed in emotional attached states of thinking it is the divine mind the super subconscious that contains within it the aspect of man that is divine the god mind it is achieved through impeccability of clear thinking of lucid mind within the extraordinary crystalline field at this point the human is in a crystalline geometric field of the merkivah the human has become a divine thinking soul and crossed the veil into the creative divine mind the divine mind is only achieved only accessed through crystalline resonance within crystalline thought waves crystalline thought is above emotion above petty feelings it is achieved in detachment it is the crystalline lake of shamballa of nirvana as smooth as glass no waves distorting its mirrored visage masters when you achieve this clarity this level of unbiased focus you have a direct alignment to the extraordinary divine field within you this field is crystal it is unclouded unwaved with doubt unfettered by fear victimization or any of the petty issues that clutter the day to day thought patterns of the limited ego mind this field of crystalline thought divine mind is devoid of the turbulent tempestuous raging of victimization judgement lust for power control anger and passionate involvement that is so often inpatterned in the repeating dialogue of the inner narrator of the ego mind it is detached from and above the storm of emotion it is bliss it is achieved in impeccability this state of beingness is the level in which we achieve the creative divinity of life this state of being is capable of manifesting all that we desire within wisdom and love the frequency of love clarity as the requisite for the crystalline creative state everything that you have read and been taught about how to achieve impeccability and how to manifest joy health and abundance in your life can only be achieved in the detached state of the crystalline mind we say again and again it does not occur in the attached state of the ego mind and it never will all you have read and learned about creating your world and manifesting your reality is merely an unachieved potential and an intriguing philosophy until you experience it directly until you do it you cannot and you will not become a true masterful divine being until you decide to become impeccable until you decide to make the effort to review your life and remove the hindrances until you love the self and then and only then can you truly love others in unconditional higher dimensional love within the crystalline field seize the day if you are hurting others if you are caught in ego in victimization control of others depression a lust for power stop it change now until you do you are doomed to repeat the cycle there is a divine intelligence a lucid clarity that takes you to the mastery you seek that is available and many of you are so close to achieving it dont stop clear the closet the lucid mind the crystalline field is achieved when the inner narrator is stopped and the frontal mind lets go of issues seek the light be honest review your life and calibrate put your best effort into everything you do encompass and live your beliefs remove fear and doubt remove anger and control love yourself love all life nurture others be detached create your world there is no ecstasy more supreme than achieving the divine mind it is why you are here sooner or later you will learn this and the sooner you do the sooner you will find within yourself that elusive doorway into the realm of creatorship of mastery it has always been there and it awaits you dear ones i am metatron and you are beloved

8513366 im glad you didnt wind up in my brig with all the others youve put here it couldve gotten nasty
8513367 we even have a couple of metalheads in the crowd
8513368 ive been trying to figure out a way to tell you i dont have feelings for you anymore
8513369 well are you happy with the state of the country
8513370 because america needs to uphold democracy throughout the world plus isnt the reason our troops are being killed with our own weapons now because we kept the commies out of afghanistan
8513371 time is valuable achievement of goals depends on productive use of time result efficiency and progress often at expense of interpersonal relationships
8513372 americans believe competition brings out the best in people and free enterprise produces most progress and success result less emphasis on cooperation than competition
8513373 how the hell am i supposed to clean this entire house and get it ready for inspection by tomorrow thats mad impossible not to mention that nathan xavier made it a point last night of all nights to stay up all night fussing about diaper rash i love how much he pees and i got no sleep
8513374 well honey its not a hugie because hes just a sargant hes not a first sargant you dont have to stress about it just clean up a little
8513375 you could see why the democrats were doomed this summer by the way they wasted their convention
8513376 i know you hear that phrase a lot in politics i mean it
8513377 i think hes coming around fine were never 100 per cent united were a pretty ornery party he gave a barnstormer of a speech tonight
8513378 saying i ws too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8513379 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8513380 if you ask me why obama lost steam in the three weeks going into the convention a big one was the failure of this campaign to define mccain and to define the choice
8513381 every day every minute ought to be focused on the choice
8513382 second im here to warm up the crowd for joe biden i love joe biden and america will too

8513394 fate only takes you so far the rest is up to you
8513395 it is easy to find reasons to give up and leave why because it is easier to just give up and not have to deal with stress and actually work at it it is more difficult to find reasons to stay and that is because the reward is so much greater if you do

8513398 isnt that that crazy guy who fought against the martin luther king holiday
8513399 i know i said that senator obama was not ready to lead or to beat senator mccain but the experience and growth both of us has had over the past few months on the campaign trail has made him obviously a far stronger candidate than he would have been without our brutal battle and things that were true than have been proven not to be the case now
8513400 those who operate on the premise of short time periods in iraq today are being more realistic
8513401 it is clear to me that democrats want to attack me rather than debate senator mccain on important economic issues facing the country

8513473 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8513474 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8513475 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8513476 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8513477 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8513508 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8513509 he not only wants to talk about military and security dimensions that are facing the united states but wants to get back into building a new set of arrangements with the world
8513510 that may help return america to a position of being a pivotal player on everything from human rights to the spreading of democracy but also just dealing with core interests of the world
8513511 joe biden really discredited himself in a big way by pushing through the resolution authorising the invasion of iraq
8513512 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president

8513516 different parliamentary blocs still have serious differences about the law
8513517 i have not heard anything new from the parliament to make me expect that the law will be passed any time soon
8513518 the vehicle was going to pick up prisoners and as it reached a bridge an explosive laden car exploded and nine of our policemen and two passers by were killed
8513519 those guys will be guys that we want to see x number of snaps from just because they havent had as many plays as some of the other players have had
8513520 i had no experience in theater at that point but i knew i had to be a part of whatever was going on after seeing that show
8513521 i was actually on stage this summer which was fun but working backstage is more my style because i have more control over what im doing and i can take time to develop my ideas
8513522 its a collaborative art and everybody has to be there and do their job
8513523 we wouldnt be able to do what we want to do if the crew wasnt there
8513524 any actors that dont respect the crew wont get work
8513525 i think one of the perks of working backstage is that i dont have to be in the spotlight
8513526 the actors are meant to be the center of attention if that is not the case then something has gone wrong
8513527 we first started it as almost a pastime wed just start freestyling
8513528 wed say whatever came to our minds first just stupid stuff then we started actually coming up with similes and metaphors that were actually good
8513529 i would say i was the first to start rapping as i started writing i encouraged justin to write then we tried to one up each other
8513530 i was freestyling with some guys and i was trying to quit smoking cigarettes so my whole rap consisted of quitting cigarettes
8513531 during my freestyle i had a cigarette and at the end of the rap i threw my cigarette on the ground and it exploded
8513532 when we were trying to come up with an alias we couldnt come up with one that wasnt taken
8513533 all the good ones were taken but so were all the bad ones
8513534 i grew up with my great grandmother she came up during severe racial strife in this country and that thelonious monk was the kind of stuff she listened to i would sit at her house and just absorb this music unconsciously
8513535 they were a lot of fun it was nice to see upbeat hip hop rather than the usual mainstream stuff
8513536 they have more of a true hip hop style its not really the indicative sound of the southern hip hop culture
8513537 i was the founder and host of the old school reunion which is a classic hip hop show
8513538 i loved to play the original songs that newer rap songs sample
8513539 i tried to give that to people our age who didnt know where the samples came from
8513540 every little bit of success that he got he laid the foundation for us
8513541 there can be amazing movies being made right now but i wont know about it because i dont look for good movies people settle for whatevers popular right now
8513542 its in hibernation right now once we come out its going to be a huge thing
8513543 weve got levels and levels to go i would like to be able to make a living off of music if i can pay my rent and my car without mopping floors or taking out the trash ill be good
8513544 my thing is that i want to influence the youth of america because were at such a pivotal point for change right now in this country and i think its important to educate the kids
8513545 when they told me i had torn my acl i was devastated just absolutely crushed
8513546 but things happen for a reason i just had to realize that and start focusing on coming back
8513547 we got off to a great start at the beginning of the year
8513548 you cant downplay the loss of charles alexander he was playing extremely well at the beginning of the season
8513549 i had to settle down and know that i could still help out the team even if i was not going to be able to be on the field
8513550 i just told him to keep striving and to not give up
8513551 he needs to just keep working hard and everything will take care of itself charles is a strong guy whos strong mentally so i know he will bounce back he just needs to listen to the trainers and know they will direct you in the right direction
8513552 its frustrating to be cleared from one injury and then to have another small one now
8513553 but its the type of thing that could have become major if i tried to push it so i just have to be patient and let myself heal before the season
8513554 i had the game taken from me in the strangest way and at the time when id have least expected it
8513555 this is my last year and i will give everything ive got and leave everything on the field each saturday
8513556 fashionistas love the bold colors and the unique design is an expression of individuality
8513557 the second quarter net profit for crocs was 2 1 million or 3 cents per share down from 48 5 million or 58 cents per share a year earlier
8513558 i do the buying and im not huge on crocs
8513559 the trend is going away with the big ugly colored shoe
8513560 the possibility of the upcoming storm i dont quite know how to deal with it
8513561 the only thing my experience tells me is that i dont know and i will take the governors lead and the chancellors lead and the system presidents lead and then the athletic directors lead in the meantime were preparing to play the appalachian state mountaineers as scheduled
8513562 its a wednesday before a monday hurricane knowing this thing could change directions 26 times before now and then
8513563 if you speculate at all it causes alarm among the fans
8513564 in 2005 that was a conference call that involved tennessee officials sec officials and us
8513565 its really just kind of gotten on my radar screen to be honest i certainly hope like the rest of the country that it stays out in the gulf and something happens we have a contingency plan and were ready as best as we can
8513566 such as the number of users who searched for a particular term for example or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement
8513567 i dont like that game prices are so high but i guess its understandable
8513568 the better games and consoles get the more we will be charged for them
8513569 companies are selling video games for such high prices because they can
8513570 people are still buying them so theres no reason for them to drop prices besides they have to make a profit to be able to continue making games typically it costs a lot more to produce a console than the price they sell it for they have to make up that difference by selling games at high prices
8513571 a large part of prices being so high has to do with licensing
8513572 only a small portion of the money from game sales goes back to the actual developer the revenue from sales is divided between those the product is licensed to including advertisers and the console manufacturer
8513573 but waiting for the price to drop can be difficult it can sometimes take two years or more for that to happen your friends will probably already have bought the game and you dont want to feel left out good old peer pressure still creating problems
8513574 i only buy a few a year thats how i keep costs down but i guess high prices do deter me from buying games more often
8513575 i think as prices get higher we will see much more episodic content in games
8513576 this means developers make a shorter less epic game then they release it by episode you buy the first episode and play it and if you like it you buy the following episodes this way youre getting less game but youre also paying for less game too
8513577 you would think that prices would eventually get so high that people would stop buying them
8513578 but we all know thats not going to happen theyre too much fun
8513579 no wrong choice is an illusion created between those with power and those without
8513580 the willingness to make conscious choices is another way of demonstrating that you are ready to find new ways of living before you are forced to do it when what we do how we do it and the way we do it no longer fits our purpose in life we must choose to do something else it means we are aware of our patterns and no longer choose to embrace them choices makes it easier and when you see that you make the wrong choice you have the ability right and power to make another choice
8513581 weve got a proven group as a whole and were going to be difficult to move the football against
8513582 dorsey was the type of player who brought pressure on both the run and the pass so replacing him is basically impossible
8513583 but guys like junior defensive tackle ricky jean francois and senior defensive tackle charles alexander are doing an extremely tremendous job out there playing hard every day and trying to get better
8513584 ricky jean may be as talented a defensive tackle as weve had in our three years here
8513585 the thing about ricky jean is hes physical and dominating enough to play the inside position and hes athletic enough to possibly move to the outside it was a tremendous setback when we didnt have him this past year
8513586 one of the things you cant downplay from last year was the loss of charles alexander
8513587 charles was playing extremely well in the beginning of the year
8513588 in a way the injury made me better mentally knowing that everything is not given to you on a silver platter
8513589 being able to go out there and practice with my teammates is a blessing not too many people come back positive from an acl injury
8513590 i just have to play my role whatever my body allows me to do i will do it to the fullest
8513591 if my body allows me to play 50 snaps ill go out there and play 50 snaps if i can just go out for one play ill be happy but if the other guys are ready and are more prepared than me since i sat out most of the camp then they deserve to get out there
8513592 the biggest things hes contributed is his leadership his will and his knowledge of the game
8513593 charles is one of those guys whos a big football head hes a real student of the game hes extremely passionate about his craft and when a guy is that passionate it rubs off on the people around him
8513594 it is mind boggling how good some of the guys coming from this years recruiting class can be in the future and not just the future but present day
8513595 some of those guys are making plays out there that veterans make only every now and then lsu will be in good hands with those guys in there
8513596 this years defensive line brings to the table a lot of young guys that are ready to play
8513597 theres a lot of depth this year i dont think we should skip a beat
8513598 we have older guys who really took us younger guys under their wings and taught us the proper technique and proper things to do
8513599 as young guys we feel like we should never let the older guys down when they ask us to do something they give their hearts out to the team and to the fans every game
8513600 glenn is gone and he was such an asset to the defensive line and the whole defense
8513601 and ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation
8513602 missing someone gets easier everyday because even though you are one day further from the last time you saw them you are one day closer to the next time you will
8513603 far in distance but near at heart youll always be the angel of my heart
8513604 when you feel alone just look at the spaces between your fingers remember that in those spaces you can see my fingers locked with yours forever
8513605 to truly love something you must first give it a chance to fail if it survives it is going to be stronger than ever distance is pure proof of this and forever we will love if we survive
8513606 oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable his judgments and his paths beyond tracing out
8513607 labouring and struggling with all his energy which so powerfully works in me

8513670 whenever people clamor for the practical and prefer to speak about the horizontal dimension for instance relationships and success the unspoken truth is that they love god less than they love themselves and each other their interest in god is in using him as a means to ends rather than in glorifying god and enjoying him forever others focus on knowing all the correct doctrines however the doctrines have become the object of their worship rather than the divine person these doctrines are meant to describe in both cases christians settle for less than god and they worship and serve the creature rather than the creator
8513671 while the reformed evangelists of the great awakening were also presidents of princeton and yale evangelists since charles finney have actually boasted in their lack of education evangelicalism has a legacy of anti intellectualism that has not only crippled its witness to the watching world but has opened the church itself up to the most remarkable reaches of stupidity and incredulity anti intellectualism is not humble humility says i dont know but ill have to look into that but pride says i dont know and thats ok to conclude that things which are beyond my reach of knowledge insight or experience are not worth knowing is the height of arrogance i am not the measure of all values all truths and all meaning i am not the center of the universe
8513672 we are not saved by believing but by christ this is why we must have jesus and his saving work held up before us constantly rather than the bare imperatives to believe to trust to decide to choose and so forth at the same time there is the opposite danger the idea that faith is merely believing that rather than believing in it is the view that faith is in propositions rather than in a person instead of jesus christ being the object of faith the doctrines about jesus become our hope this is hardly a living relationship with a person so it is understandable that people with this defective view of faith show little personal interest in god or christian faith and practice
8513673 everyone needs theology because everyone needs god in fact one could say without exaggeration that the whole bible is concerned with theology since everything in it is intended as gods self disclosure in christ it tells us about his nature his purposes and his activity if we do not love theology we do not love god and we do not love the bible happily for us god has not left us to figure things out on our own since our own imaginations are idol factories he has taken the initiative to speak to us and to show us what he is like

8513695 picking up from the example of north cotabato vice gov emmanuel pi ols anti bangsamoro and anti lumad army of ilagas puno is now encouraging funding and promoting the all out development of an armed civilian army in mindanao and eventually all over the country
8513696 puno has since the marcos martial law days been obsessed with building the local version of brown shirts stormtroopers hitlers loose civilian army whose unabated sanctioned rampage against jews and communists and all remaining resistance to the establishment of nazi power preceded the official fascist transformation of the german state
8513697 punos concept then was to build up first marcos barangay tanods as a barangay based marcos civilian army indoctrinating them as a fascist force and then arming them and letting them loose as an unofficial but key adjunct of the martial law regimes fascist army puno had already initiated a number of secret training schools in tagaytay and several other places for marcos brown shirts when the scheme was overtaken by the edsa uprising in february 1986
8513698 now with his support of warlord private armies and his current campaign for the recruitment deputizing funding and arming more civilian volunteer organizations cvo and police auxiliaries in mindanao puno has revived his brown shirts plan this time for gloria arroyo his plan is to let them loose not only against the milf and npa but also to commit genocide against the bangsamoro and lumad as well as to suppress all opposition to the perpetuation of power of the ruling regime

8513711 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
8513712 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
8513713 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
8513714 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
8513715 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
8513716 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
8513717 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself

8513720 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
8513721 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
8513722 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
8513723 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
8513724 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
8513725 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
8513726 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
8513727 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
8513728 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
8513729 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life

8513741 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
8513742 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
8513743 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
8513744 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
8513745 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
8513746 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent

8513761 hes biden got experience hes very down to earth he complements obama i think quite well with maturity and experience especially in foreign affairs
8513762 i think from the very beginning once he clinched the nomination he was what i thought would be the better choice for vice president
8513763 on the minus side biden has bombed out twice as a presidential candidate the first time he ran there were accusations of plagiarism he can be gaffe prone but he does bring what obama needs on this ticket experience gravitas and tremendous knowledge in the area of foreign policy joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
8513764 and sometimes it is not working and you have to cut the friend adrift
8513765 its hard to think of a single speech that did more

8513768 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and country lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8513769 i have spoken to many of you who have expressed your questions about what you should do
8513770 now many of you feel a responsibility to represent the voters in the states that you came from and others of you after this long journey weve been on want the chance to vote for whats in your heart now still others will be voting for senator obama because they want to demonstrate their personal commitment to the unity of this party behind our nominee
8513771 it is traditional that we have nominations that we have a roll call
8513772 im not going to take any lectures on how to be a good democrat from two people who have spent the last two years attacking bill and hillary clinton
8513773 i think its unfortunate that a news organization with a great tradition like nbc has been taken over by those kind of antics

8513911 my soul fell into abysmal depths the bottom of which cannot be seen for it is immense then i was pushed into one of those fiery cavities and pressed as it were between burning planks and sharp nails and red hot irons seemed to be piercing my flesh i felt as if they were endeavoring to pull out my tongue but could not this torture reduced me to such agony that my very eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets i think this was because of the fire which burns burns not a finger nail escapes terrifying torments and all the time one cannot move even a finger to gain some relief not change posture for the body seems flattened out and yet doubled in two sounds of confusion and blasphemy cease not for an instant a sickening stench asphyxiates and corrupts everything it is like the burning of putrefied flesh mingled with tar and sulphur a mixture to which nothing on earth can be compared although these tortures were terrific they would be bearable if the soul were at peace but it suffers indescribably all i have written
8513912 is but a shadow of what the soul suffers for no words can express such dire torment
8513913 today i saw a vast number of people fall into the fiery pit
8513914 tonight i was transported to a place where all was obscure around me were seven or eight people i could see them only by the reflections of the fire they were seated and were talking together one said well have to be very careful not to be found out for we might easily be discovered
8513915 while i was at prayer one day i found myself in a moment without knowing how plunged apparently into hell
8513916 the entrance seemed to be by a long narrow pass like a furnace very low dark and close
8513917 but as to what i then felt i do not know where to begin if i were to describe it it is utterly inexplicable
8513918 these sufferings were nothing in comparison with the anguish of my soul a sense of oppression of stifling and of pain so acute accompanied by so hopeless and cruel an infliction that i know not how to speak of it
8513919 left in that pestilential place and utterly without the power to hope for comfort i could neither sit nor lie down there was no room
8513920 our lord at that time would not let me see more of hell
8513921 i was so terrified by that vision and that terror is on me even now as i write that though it took place nearly six years ago the natural warmth of my body is chilled by fear even now when i think of it
8513922 ever since that time as i was saying everything seems endurable in comparison with one instant of suffering such as those i had then to bear in hell
8513923 it was that vision which filled me with very great distress which i felt at the sight of so many lost souls especially of the lutherans for they were once members of the church by baptism and also gave me the most vehement desires for the salvation of souls for certainly i believe that to save even one from those overwhelming torments i would willingly endure many deaths
8513924 this also makes me wish that in a matter which concerns us so much we did not rest satisfied with doing less than we can do on our part that we left nothing undone may our lord vouchsafe to give us his grace for that end
8513925 ahora me quieren acusar de hasta asesino de intento asesinato

8513929 weve had the worst scandal in our history watergate and this nominee gerald ford pardoned the guy who did it
8513930 what time is it its time for them to go
8513931 and sometimes it is not working and you have to cut the friend adrift
8513932 if she meant it as a paraphrase of something that has been attributed to harriet tubman that might be understandable
8513933 but if she was meaning to quote harriet tubman directly that puzzled me
8513934 by the time harriet tubman enters fully into the american consciousness as an american icon her historical person has been so mixed up with ideas that cannot be historically substantiated that what passed into memory was the mythologized symbol not the historical person
8513935 because she was illiterate we have mediated histories of her stories always told by others that leave it open to a great deal of interpretation and reinterpretation by each generation as they search for a usable harriet tubman
8513936 while this is frequently attributed to her and you find it in many books written for children i was unable to find it in any of the primary documents that date from harriet tubmans life or something that she might have recounted to someone else who then took it down firsthand
8513937 semifictional accounts of her life in the 1950s or even later in the 1960s when there was an explosion of interest in writers at a time when there was a great felt need for remedying the neglect of african american history
8513938 historically inaccurate notion that she had something coming to her
8513939 bound for the promised land harriet tubman portrait of an american hero
8513940 a father knows hes a success when he turns and looks at his son or daughter and know that they turned out better than he did

8513943 afghanistan we dont read about it anymore in papers because it succeeded

8513945 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and country lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8513946 i have spoken to many of you who have expressed your questions about what you should do
8513947 now many of you feel a responsibility to represent the voters in the states that you came from and others of you after this long journey weve been on want the chance to vote for whats in your heart now still others will be voting for senator obama because they want to demonstrate their personal commitment to the unity of this party behind our nominee
8513948 it is traditional that we have nominations that we have a roll call
8513949 im not going to take any lectures on how to be a good democrat from two people who have spent the last two years attacking bill and hillary clinton
8513950 i think its unfortunate that a news organization with a great tradition like nbc has been taken over by those kind of antics
8513951 porque desde la creaci n del mundo las cualidades invisibles de dios es decir su eterno poder y su naturaleza divina se perciben claramente a trav s de lo que l cre de modo que nadie tiene excusa
8513952 como sodoma y gomorra y las ciudades vecinas las cuales de la misma manera que aqu llos habiendo fornicado e ido en pos de vicios contra naturaleza fueron puestas por ejemplo sufriendo el castigo del fuego eterno
8513953 a pesar de haber conocido a dios no lo glorificaron como a dios ni le dieron gracias sino que se extraviaron en sus in tiles razonamientos y se les oscureci su insensato coraz n aunque afirmaban ser sabios se volvieron necios y cambiaron la gloria del dios inmortal por im genes que eran r plicas del hombre mortal de las aves de los cuadr pedos y de los reptiles por eso dios los entreg a los malos deseos de sus corazones que conducen a la impureza sexual de modo que degradaron sus cuerpos los unos con los otros cambiaron la verdad de dios por la mentira adorando y sirviendo a los seres creados antes que al creador quien es bendito por siempre am n por tanto dios los entreg a pasiones vergonzosas en efecto las mujeres cambiaron las relaciones naturales por las que van contra la naturaleza as mismo los hombres dejaron las relaciones naturales con la mujer y se encendieron en pasiones lujuriosas los unos con los otros hombres con hombres cometieron actos indecentes y en s mismos recibieron el castigo que merec a su perversi n adem s como estimaron que no val a la pena tomar en cuenta el conocimiento de dios l a su vez los entreg a la depravaci n mental para que hicieran lo que no deb an hacer se han llenado de toda clase de maldad perversidad avaricia y depravaci n est n repletos de envidia homicidios disensiones enga o y malicia son chismosos calumniadores enemigos de dios insolentes soberbios y arrogantes se ingenian maldades se rebelan contra sus padres son insensatos desleales insensibles despiadados saben bien que seg n el justo decreto de dios quienes practican tales cosas merecen la muerte sin embargo no s lo siguen practic ndolas sino que incluso aprueban a quienes las practican
8513954 y no debes acostarte con un var n igual a como te acuestas con una mujer es cosa detestable
8513955 y cuando un hombre se acuesta con un var n igual a como uno se acuesta con una mujer ambos han hecho una cosa detestable deben ser muertos sin falta su propia sangre est sobre ellos

8513964 there may be consequences here for robbery or murder but nobody can do anything to me if i am gone
8513965 when an atheist is tempted to destroy himself he has no concern whether it be lawful or no t for he knows of no law nor power that can reach to punish him such a wretch doth not believe there is any other world to receive him when he dies out of this nor any god there to call him to account he supposes his soul vanishes into air and his dust is safe from vengeance these are the sentiments of atheism and vile and irrational as they are yet they are the only principles that can give any tolerable colour or pretence for self murder
8513966 what is there that casts a greater blot upon the name of any man so long as his memory lives in the world than to say he hanged or drowned he poisoned or stabbed himself this is a stain that shall never be wiped away and when thou risest out of thy grave at the last day thou shalt arise to everlasting shame and contempt besides all thy other sins this shall be published before angels and men that thou wert guilty of the most unnatural wickedness in the world what a senseless practice is it for men to bring upon them selves eternal shame and confusion only for this end that they may escape what is temporal
8513967 mans goings are of the lord how can a man then understand his own way
8513968 i have seen all the works that are done under the sun and behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit
8513969 medical illness plays an important role in the motivation to commit suicide
8513970 and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth
8513971 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die
8513972 can a soldier who is fixed in his post though it rain and blow at midnight forsake his guard before his general permits him to
8513973 whosoever sheds mans blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man
8513974 for without are dogs and sorcerers and whore mongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie
8513975 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death
8513976 ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him
8513977 for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself
8513978 fear him referring to god which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell
8513979 then judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders saying i have sinned against innocent blood and they said what is that to us see thou to that and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself
8513980 he became his own executioner thinking hereby to avoid shame but running upon a heinous sin and with it entailing upon his own name a mark of perpetual infamy as felo de se a self murderer saul died as a fool dieth as a coward dieth a proud fool a sneaking coward he died as a man that had neither the fear of god nor hope in god
8513981 and it came to pass when zimri saw that city was taken that he went into the palace of the kings house and burnt the kings house over him with fire and died for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the lord
8513982 consider what sort of men they have been who are recorded in scripture as self murderers ahithophel a false traitor who counselled absalom to rebel against his father david saul a bloody man who forsook god and was forsaken of god zimri a most wicked king of israel and judas who betrayed our blessed saviour
8513983 do not be excessively wicked why should you die before your time
8513984 says the self murderer i will not endure this trial i will rid myself of this hardship i will bear it no longer i have no patience nor will i submit to this method of divine probation i will hasten my appearance before the judgment seat there let my judge determine my final estate according to the days of my past life and past trials for i will not suffer my state of probation to be prolonged any farther
8513985 the civil government did heretofore appoint that they should be put into the earth with utmost contempt and this was generally done in some public crossway that the shame and infamy might be made known to every passenger and that this infamy might be lasting they were ordained to have a stake driven through their dead bodies which was not to be removed english law calls a self murderer felo de se or a felon to himself and upon this account the estate and effects of the deceased are forfeited by law and cannot descend to the relatives unless it appear that the person who laid violent hands upon himself was distracted were such a person sure that his estate would be forfeited and his effects carried away from his wife children and family were he sure that his dead body should be publicly exposed buried in the highway and with a stake driven through it as a mark of huge infamy perhaps he would give way to calmer counsels and be content to bear a little shame or pain or loss till god saw fit to put an end to all his sufferings by natural means
8513986 and when his armour bearer saw that saul was dead he fell likewise upon his sword and died with him
8513987 to exalt the persons of self murderers to heaven is an evil and a dangerous practice
8513988 it may be said i will repent and pray for the pardon of my sin before i do it i answer what a delusion of satan i have read indeed of a philosopher who called upon his gods and so threw himself into the fire to his own destruction
8513989 repentance is a supernatural and inward revelation from god giving a deep consciousness of what i am in his sight which causes me to loathe and condemn myself resulting in a bitter sorrow for sin a holy horror and hatred for sin and a turning away from or forsaking of sin
8513990 resolve either to leave every known sin and submit to every known duty or else never look to find mercy and favour with god
8513991 even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone
8513992 consider what it is to suffer extreme torment for ever and ever to suffer it day and night from one year to another from one age to another and from one thousand ages to another and so adding age to age and thousands to thousands in pain in wailing and lamenting groaning and shrieking and gnashing your teeth with your souls full of
8513993 strive to enter in at the straight gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able
8513994 i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
8513995 the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom
8513996 submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you
8513997 ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him
8513998 set your affections on things above not on things on the earth
8513999 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death

8514010 not reacting visibly to something that might be expected to produce manifestations of an emotion or feeling
8514011 i lost all thoughts of past ambition my concepts of family were totally warped i was reckless and self destructive but i thought it was happiness i was feeling i was so disillusioned into feeling so artistic and intellectual all the time i lost sight of everything else in my life but the drug and what it did to me

8514057 by building embankments on either side of a river and trying to confine it to its channel its heavy silt and sand load is made to settle within the embanked area itself raising the river bed and the f lood water level the embankments too are therefore raised progressively until a limit is reached when it is no longer possible to do so the population of the surrounding areas is then at the mercy of an unstable river with a dangerous flood water level which could any day flow over or make a disastrous breach
8514058 rainwater collects outside the embankments and the rise in the water level within causes seepage through the embankments to the
8514059 today it is hazardous to live near the embankments waterlogging has left valuable land unfit for cultivation productivi ty has come down drastically yet people live there with a false sense of security
8514060 it is impossible for us to save north bihar from floods without the cooperation of nepal it is for the union government to tak e up this issue with that country
8514061 w e have been doctored into believing that when there is a lot of water it is because the nepal government releases it to india cant nepal take water to its own land
8514062 if the water flows naturally as it did in our villa ges before these embankments were built a flood would spread slowly and affect us less but add to these embankments a big dam in nepal what will happen if it bursts as the embankments do now

8514088 crossfit is in large part derived from several simple observations garnered through hanging out with athletes for thirty years and willingness if not eagerness to experiment coupled with a total disregard for conventional wisdom let me share some of the more formative of these observations 1 gymnasts learn new sports faster than other athletes 2 olympic lifters can apply more useful power to more activities than other athletes 3 powerlifters are stronger than other athletes 4 sprinters can match the cardiovascular performance of endurance athletes even at extended efforts 5 endurance athletes are woefully lacking in total physical capacity 6 with high carb diets you either get fat or weak 7 bodybuilders cant punch jump run or throw like athletes can 8 segmenting training efforts delivers a segmented capacity 9 optimizing physical capacity requires training at unsustainable intensities 10 the worlds most successful athletes and coaches rely on exercise science the way deer hunters rely on the accordion

8514091 were canvasing the neighborhood talking to registered voters are you a registered voter
8514092 well were going around talking to everyone about proposition 8 voting yes on prop 8
8514093 were trying to get people to vote yes on prop 8 its about protecting the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman
8514094 oh do you already have a stand on prop 8
8514095 why yes i do this whole household is voting no on proposition 8 we all stand that marriage is between two people who love each other not a matter of gender
8514096 and you see that car in the driveway the one with church equality and rainbow stickers yeah all of our cars pretty much look like that
8514097 whos a good puppy barking at the close minded people whos a good girl
8514098 sometimes you are the hammer sometimes you are the nail
8514099 you can make excuses for anything in life focus on what you are supposed to be doing and drop the excuses
8514100 sometimes you are the hammer sometimes you are the nail
8514101 were learning all these throwing techniques but in a match we may only be using 5 or 6 right
8514102 as long as youre green youre growing as soon as youre ripe you begin to rot
8514103 as soon as something fails to contribute and grow it dies
8514104 only that which is supple gentle and yielding will survive that which is hard unyielding will dry up wither and die
8514105 nous en avons tous discut et nous sommes tous davis quil est grand temps de mettre ton blog jour
8514106 votre temps sur cette terre est limit ne le perdez dons pas vivre la vie de quelquun dautre
8514107 vous devez trouver ce que vous aimez que ce soit en amour ou au travail
8514108 but as for you you meant evil against me but god meant it for good in order to bring it about as it is this day to save many people alive
8514109 but dont be angry with yourselves that you did this to me for god did it he sent me here ahead of you to preserve your lives
8514110 no this suffering doesnt make any sense at all its meaningless theres no point to it
8514111 greg id love to but i cant i have to go to a hospital
8514112 whenever i go speak in some location i always find out where the local burn ward is and i go and visit the patients
8514113 look i know how hard it is i have been there but i got through it and here is what god has been doing in and through my life since i got out of the hospital he can do the same for you
8514114 he is the source of every mercy and the god who comforts us he comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others when others are troubled we will be able to give them the same comfort god has given us you can be sure that the more we suffer for christ the more god will shower us with his comfort through christ
8514115 with mixergy i dont know andrew very well but i do like his jackets i dont want to talk about mixergy in the context of failure my good friend and associate chris gammill danced with the ugly step sister of failure id like to think that andrew iterated and didnt fail
8514116 in this you greatly rejoice though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials these have come so that your faith of greater worth than gold which perishes even though refined by fire may be proved genuine and may result in praise glory and honor when jesus christ is revealed
8514117 i never knew i could miss someone that i had never met
8514118 in this you greatly rejoice though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials these have come so that your faith of greater worth than gold which perishes even though refined by fire may be proved genuine and may result in praise glory and honor when jesus christ is revealed
8514119 yes i may not be here by choice but damn it i am here
8514120 were really pleased that the court agreed with our position it shows that the government has to be responsive to the public that they serve
8514121 its premature to say what our next steps might be
8514122 it makes no more sense to be offended at the site of a nude human than it does to be offended at the sight of a redwood tree
8514123 he said youre suspended until you can change your hair i dont feel like i should have to because im expressing myself as an individual because they constantly tell us be different dont follow the crowd
8514124 put a bag over your head i dont want to look at you
8514125 i want to do that see when carlin passed away i knew he had an incredible volume of work but when they did the retrospective and showed he had 14 hbo specials and it was all a material he never burned out that was really inspiring
8514126 thats the road i want to go so ive got my next hour
8514127 theaters get booked up theaters are union some are non union all of this stuff you have to plan
8514128 i still listen to old pryors and when he talks about ali i dont think oh he was champion 30 years ago no if its a funny joke its funny
8514129 the funny thing about the swimming movie is i never even saw it i just saw the trailer its already bad enough to know that people wanted to go swimming and they got s amp for it but then to make it cartoonish theres no sense of reality its just done from a very this is right and this is wrong and every character is either 100 percent right or 100 percent wrong eddie murphy did something about aids and 25 years later some group got pissed about it and was talking about it and came after him and i thought that was unbelievably unfair if he said something and someone didnt like it to play monday morning quarterback 25 years later is pretty ridiculous
8514130 there are a lot of comics who say well i cant get away with that i hate that expression because it implies that you mean something malicious and the crowd is too stupid to realize it
8514131 you can talk about what you want to talk about as long as its funny it all comes down to your intent the funny thing is comedians in general are pretty stubborn people its more like white people dont hang out with other kinds of people so they havent had any sort of interaction once youre dealing with a demographic like that thats isolated in that way they start thinking in columns this group is like that and that group is like this i remember one time i was in a barbershop
8514132 she whispered black as if she meant something bad youre dealing with a herd mentality if youre doing stand up and a group is dealing with herd mentality you tell a joke and it causes them to relax for the most part people are decent people
8514133 a lot of the jokes i do i deliberately am walking along a path is he going to say something f amp ed up its a way of keeping peoples attention
8514134 people were standing outside for longer than they should have i joked that he fell asleep out of boredom but he was f amp ing wasted
8514135 to be honest i completely forgot about that we taped it i did it and we moved on theres so much involved in selling it the cover the photo shoots the release of it all this stuff it was a great experience and im going to continue doing it that way i hope to get to the point where i can put up the money myself
8514136 the philly thing a lot of people were asking me so i said yeah i got to put that on there
8514137 it was such a huge part of my development as a comedian
8514138 it was a dream of mine to be in new york and work all of the clubs and have 12 sets on a weekend and hop in a cab to get to the next club take me to 82 nd and 2 nd it just sounded cool to me and that hasnt worn off that i can go into new york city and walk into a comedy club and have them know me and ask if i want to do a set that stuff blows me away
8514139 me and jeff cesario weve got a pilot script done im really excited about it
8514140 when i was doing chappelles show i was just happy to be there and i didnt want to screw up
8514141 when i was doing that show i was right where i should have been which was third or fourth banana in a sketch learning where i should be and learning how to be comfortable
8514142 the sitcom ive tried two of those i cant shoot what it is that i want to do into a sitcom at least not on a major network because theyre trying to appeal to too many people its strange because you watch sitcoms from the 1970s and thye took way more changes
8514143 believe it or not i was tired of new york and i just wasnt making the inroads that i wanted to to make it to the next level and then i moved out here and there was a strike so that was great but the move was great for my peace of mind
8514144 the stand up scene was definitely a little depressing when i first came out here until i got to know some of the guys who were good its l a there are a lot of funny and talented people here
8514145 but there are definitely a lot of people who are onstage here for something other than their stand up chops youre the fat guy youre the chick youre the asian guy that part is depressing then i realized there are a lot of rooms outside of the city the comedy store ive loved it just seems the most like a new york club a place where comics can hang out but there are a lot of random rooms out here where you can have a good time
8514146 right now im waiting to find out about a movie
8514147 ive learned how to stop from being crazy in the audition process and just go in and kill it but its been a lot of fun i f amp ing love it out here i lived here 10 years earlier and never got a chance to love it
8514148 the chaplaincy at eastbourne contacted us after some kids said there was a body floating in the water
8514149 we were preparing to retrieve the body when all of a sudden a car drove off the cliff at the same time
8514150 we made our way to the car as it was more likely the man in the vehicle would still be alive
8514151 the tide was in which made it very difficult a coastguard helicopter spotted the second mans body in the water he had been thrown clear of the car
8514152 look at the map on the wall put your fingers on where we are no matter where i go were just an inch apart
8514153 not that old speech again if were just an inch apart then reach out and grab my hand
8514154 most book recommendation websites work by listing random peoples reviews on goodreads when a person adds a book to the site all their friends can see what they thought of it its common sense people are more likely to get excited about a book their friend recommends than a suggestion from a stranger
8514155 the whole film is basically about the difficulty of transporting somebody across a border and i think without getting too far into the patriot act were coming into an age when borders will be strong
8514156 and i think that our society for the most part will be numb to it and wont recognize what is happening because we have our freedom in the virtual world and our freedom on the internet so subconsciously on some level were satisfied with the kinds of freedom we have i think its a bait and switch
8514157 any food substance that is highly pleasant to the taste as a child and tastes shockingly unpleasant once you become an adult

8514160 ill think of some way to get him back theres never been a man i couldnt get once i set my mind on him after all tomorrow is another day

8514162 taste of the holidays which is always so special at our church
8514163 you have nothing to feel guilty about do what you need to do to survive and more importantly be happy anyway thats what family separation allowance is for
8514164 when thinking of the anima as the soul guide we are apt to think of beatrice leading dante up to paradise but we should not forget that he experienced that only after he had gone through hell normally the anima does not take a man by the hand and lead him right up to paradise she puts him first into a hot cauldron where he is nicely roasted for a while
8514165 there was a subversion of the constitution on november 3 and that is what people are protesting against
8514166 we are committed to the supremacy of the constitution and this will continue until the actions of november 3 are reversed

8514168 the closer i come to you the closer i am to finding god youre a miracle to me
8514169 hi my name is adam lastname i live in street address and go to name of school because i know you you will hunt me down and kill me

8514176 jesus how could you possibly allow yourself to walk out the door looking like that hideous
8514177 you are simply too fat to live you really dont deserve to be here
8514178 ha is he kidding first off mame am i that old and second i just said one right in front of him does he just want to rub it in that i am all alone jerk
8514179 now these sons of mosiah were with alma at the time the angel first appeared unto him therefore alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren and what added more to his joy they were still his brethren in the lord yea and they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently that they might know the word of god
8514180 chains do not appear to have been available to the olmec or maya during the book of mormon timeframe

8514182 might merely have been mechanically repeating a biblical phrase they had learned from the brass plates
8514183 book of mormon apologists in short have a long way to go in order to establish the credibility of
8514184 all jesting aside the point of my post was primarily to refute some very dubious archaeological evidence that has been presented by apologists who shall remain unnamed in favor of the existence of mesoamerican chains thats why i didnt dwell at any great length on book of mormon exegesis

8514207 aneh kalau kemiskinan saya harus dibuktikan dari dulu saya ke sekolah sudah naik sepeda ketika dulu sepeda saya dirusak gredo
8514208 ipung menoleh ke arah pak bakri dan guru itu membalasnya dengan lambaian tangan
8514209 itu sepeda saya satu satunya dan menyesal saya gagal menahan kemarahan maka saya lawan gredo dia naik mobil tapi dengan orang bersepeda saja iri
8514210 begitu juga marjikun wajah dia dan wajah saya sama sama tidak cakepnya tapi dia iri juga
8514211 saya marah karena hak saya diganggu kaya atau miskin rasanya kita punya hak yang sama untuk marah saya tidak melihat alasan harus menahan marah gara gara kemiskinan
8514212 tapi lagi lagi saya punya hak untuk berjuang mengatasi rasa minder saya di depan pintu saya termangu menatap karpetnya yang tebal haruskah saya melepas sepatu saya
8514213 kemudian saya ketemu orang tua paulin mami papi paulin hanya menantu gila yang tidak grogi melihat calon mertua
8514214 tapi apakah semudah itu saya diterima sebagai calon menantunya tidak alot sekali penerimaan itu tapi apakah saya menyerah siapa yang mengharuskan saya untuk menyerah miskin atau kaya siapa saja bisa melakukannya jadi marjikun tak usah mengadili saya di tempat seperti ini kalau ingin mengobati rasa mindernya
8514215 marjikun aku heran wajahmu mirip mandra apa yang kamu risaukan
8514216 saya yakin karena mandra minder maka ia pilih jadi bintang sinetron karena saya minder saya nekat mencintai paulin bukan sebaliknya
8514217 kita sama sama tidak cakep marjikun tapi adalah suatu bukti kalau paulin mencintai saya sekian

8514225 if i can release my delegates and you know how hard i fought for them
8514226 then the president can certainly release detainees held in guantanamo those where there is little or no hard evidence they did anything wrong
8514227 allowing her delegates to go free is a dangerous precedent for americas national security
8514228 sympathizing with the terrorists we thankfully have locked up at guantanamo
8514229 a shameful misusification of the war on terror for political reasons as a popular war president i would never stupefy so low as to use fear hatred and war to build the political capital i need to be that popular war president that i became so we wont grant releasification of any of those prisoners no matter how innocent they may be

8514312 on 26 august 2008 some staff members had distributed some documents to the journalists and asked them to wait outside of the fence but later there was no one from the center to inform them what happened or to offer interviews to the journalists so that the journalists both khmers and foreigners after waiting until after 11 00 finally decided to leave
8514313 the journalists said that maybe the staff of the center for social development asked the journalists to sit and wait to share with them the arguments between staff and board that is why they did not offer any interviews and did not say anything at the beginning
8514314 according to some staff the center for social development started to have internal disputes since ms
8514315 many analysts said that leading a small center depending on foreign donations can bring rifts and disagreements what laws to teach to citizens and therefore how citizens can then consider them as models
8514316 the letters announcing the press conference of the center for social development on 26 august 2008 say that ms seng theary had already once been fired on 20 may 2008 and then she was fired a second time by the board of directors on 24 june 2008
8514317 the board of directors of the center for social development has intervened with ms seng thearys work already twice once on 18 july 2007 and then again on 10 september 2007
8514318 ms seng theary has been hired to work since march 2006 during her work at the center for social development she had attended only four of the nine meeting of the board of directors
8514319 ms seng theary does not follow the contract she had agreed to with the board of directors of the center for social development
8514320 ms seng theary had formed a board of directors while she was working under the administration of the board of directors of the center for social development there are eleven members in the new board of directors as published by the
8514321 ms seng theary had rejected a request to reorganize the statute structures for the center for social development under the guidance by oxfam united states
8514322 ms seng theary does not fully cooperate with two arbiters one comes from an important donor country and another one is the founder of the center for social development as a result the center for social development lost aid from an important donor country
8514323 it has been 63 days since the board of directors terminated ms seng theary to leave her position for a long period vacant would affect the prestige of the center for social development and also its resources for the foundation also other foundations may not continue with their support from about october 2008

8514326 barangsiapa yang berpuasa romadhon karena iman dan ihtisab niscaya dosanya yang telah berlalu akan diampuni
8514327 shalat lima waktu yang satu dengan lainnya ibadah jumah menuju jumah yang lain ramadhan menuju ramadhan sesudahnya menjadi penghapus dosa dosa selama dosa dosa besar dijauhi
8514328 puasa adalah perisai apabila kamu sedang puasa janganlah berkata jorok janganlah berteriak teriak dan janganlah berbuat bodoh apabila ada seseorang yang mencacinya atau memeranginya maka katakanlah sesungguhnya aku sedang puasa sebanyak dua kali
8514329 puasa adalah perisai yang digunakan hamba untuk melindungi dirinya dari neraka
8514330 demi dzat yang jiwa muhammad berada di tangan nya sungguh bau mulut orang yang sedang puasa itu lebih harum di sisi alloh pada hari kiamat daripada bau minyak kasturi
8514331 harumnya bau mulut orang yang berpuasa di sisi alloh melebihi harumnya minyak kasturi karena ia timbul dari pengaruh puasa sehingga baunya harum di sisi alloh subahanahu dan dicintai nya ini adalah dalil yang menunjukkan agungnya kedudukan puasa di sisi alloh sampai sampai sesuatu yang tidak disenangi dan dirasa kotor di sisi manusia menjadi sesuatu yang dicintai di sisi alloh serta berbau harum karena ia muncul dari ketaatannya dengan menjalankan puasa
8514332 sesungguhnya di dalam surga terdapat sebuah pintu yang disebut ar royyaan pada hari kiamat orang orang yang berpuasa masuk melalui pintu itu tidak seorangpun yang masuk selain mereka apabila mereka telah masuk maka pintu itu ditutup dan tidak ada lagi orang yang masuk melewatinya

8514341 storm of protest that mikhailovs conduct generated among jews and the mainstream media in russia and abroad
8514342 is it not true today as it was in the 1920s and 30s that delay and irresolution on the part of the democracies simply invite future threats and graver dangers

8514353 we have lost another champion another hero greg fought to the end and delivered a clear message to congress
8514354 the members of congress cannot understand what these men and women are experiencing not only are those who served at ground zero suffering sick and dying but families are devastated putting childrens futures at risk these heroes must have an america which takes care of instead of forgets its heroes the james zadroga 9 11 health amp compensation bill must be passed when congress returns from recess so that this national disgrace can finally come to an end
8514355 we are going to put the honest truth about ground zeros suffering heroes in their faces and hope that decency will prevail and they finally pass this legislation before another september 11th passes all of us are wondering about cancers and other diseases that are showing up five six seven years later what will our families face in the future
8514356 patriotism in my view does not mean unquestioning acceptance of whatever the government does to go along with whatever your government does is not a characteristic of democracy i remember in my own early education we were taught that it was a sign of a totalitarian state of a dictatorship when people did not question what their government did if you live in a democratic state it means you have the right to criticize your governments policies

8514362 it is not for you to know the times or dates the father has set by
8514363 i tell you the truth whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned he has crossed over from death to life
8514364 that if you confess with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved
8514365 they were longing for a better country a heavenly one he has prepared a city for them
8514366 for we brought nothing into the world and we can take nothing out
8514367 after that we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so we will be with the lord forever
8514368 he will wipe every tear from their eyes there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain
8514369 but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal
8514370 for he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of righteousness
8514371 the city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it for the glory of god gives it light and the lamb is its lamp for there will be no night there
8514372 now is the time of gods favor now is the day of

8514376 where were you when i made the decision at the councils of jerusalem nicea constantinople ephesus and all of the ecumenical councils
8514377 the community reaction is going to be that of surprise but from what i know of the details he is not known to have any connection with the muslim community in derby
8514378 everything is scanned before it goes up so its an indirect connection
8514379 i dont know and even if i did i wouldnt be able to tell you for it security reasons
8514380 its not a frequent occurrence but this isnt the first time
8514381 alif laam raa a book which we have revealed to you muhammad so that you may lead the people from out of the darknesses into the light by their lords leave to the path of the all mighty the praiseworthy
8514382 and whomsoever god wills to guide he opens his chest to islam and whomsoever he wills to let go astray he makes his chest to be tight and constricted as if he is climbing up to the sky this way god puts the anger on those who dont believe
8514383 except those who repent and believe in islamic monotheism and do righteous deeds as for such allah will change their sins to good deeds allah is ever forgiving merciful
8514384 i bear witness that ali is the friend of god i bear witness that ali is the proof of god
8514385 i declare my innocence before allah that i should have any bosom friend among you for allah most high has taken me as his friend just as he took ibrahim as his friend if i were to take any bosom friend from my nation i would take abubakr listen those who came before you took the graves of their prophets and their righteous ones as places of worship listen do not take graves as places of worship i forbid you that
8514386 open the gate for him and give him the glad tidings of entering

8514389 if i choose a friend i will choose abubakr as a friend
8514390 do the people think that they will be left to say we believe without being put to the test 29 2
8514391 dont pay your income taxes if our farms dont get their fair share of water
8514392 well be giving control of our food supply to foreign countries
8514393 you cant just have a cabinet without a mandate he should wait for the conclusion of the dialogue together with the mdc otherwise what he is doing is a recipe for disaster
8514394 the liberalisation of markets in the region does not only open up opportunities but also brings along some challenges in terms of ensuring fair competition in such liberalised markets
8514395 we expect the first cut to come in april 2009 however once the interest rate cycle turns rates are often cut much faster and by more than the market expects particularly when the economy is showing signs of stress

8514407 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8514408 the key message of our report is that the circumstances in which people are born grow live work and age are the fundamental drivers of health and health inequity
8514409 we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy
8514410 a more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity to make health and health equity a marker for government performance
8514411 health inequity really is a matter of life and death
8514412 unprecedented leadership is needed that compels all actors including those beyond the health sector to examine their impact on health
8514413 if we are talking about scos move from an economic organization to a military one then this has already happened
8514414 all the member states were willing in response to the strengthening of nato
8514415 can nato indefinitely build up its forces and means there
8514416 were not afraid of anything of a new cold war
8514417 if our partners want to maintain good relations with russia they will understand our decision
8514418 we have noted the latest developments of the situation and we hope relevant parties find a proper resolution of the issue through dialogue
8514419 but silence on this question will de facto mean agreement and more importantly china will move to block any economic sanctions against russia within the un
8514420 there are many people who actually believe that the whole thing worked out as a good deal you give up a leg and get 150 000 marks 76 700 euros 113 000 in exchange
8514421 and ive heard people who think like that more than once i think its awful
8514422 we have a woman participating in the group who lost her husband and son
8514423 she gets 280 marks 143 euros 210 benefits the legislator took her into account as a divorcee which really hurt her and then the death of a relatively young man was calculated and the benefit works out very small as a result you can imagine that 280 marks is not enough to live on
8514424 there will be no more military aerial acrobatics displays in the republic of germany
8514425 what is more scandalous is that it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data rendering them unfit to be charged with protecting our safety
8514426 the risks associated with surveillance increase with the range and volume of information collected
8514427 the government has a crucial role to play in maintaining the trust of the public any evaluation of the use of surveillance must take into account the potential risk to this relationship with the public

8514436 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8514437 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8514438 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8514439 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8514440 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8514441 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8514442 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8514443 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8514444 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8514454 theyre asking for another four years in a just world theyd get 10 to 20
8514455 but i guarantee on the first night of the republican convention youre going to hear talk about barack obama commander in chief tax cuts et cetera et cetera
8514456 didnt ridicule him in the way the republicans did kerry
8514457 just like all conventions the campaign of the nominee is working with all of the speakers on the message of the convention
8514458 one of my proudest moments was when i received keys to my first classroom it was high quality public education that allowed this son of strawberry sharecroppers raised in the japanese american internment camps of world war ii to grow up to become a peace corps volunteer a vice chair of the dnc and chair of the congressional asian pacific american caucus
8514459 my name is austin these are my sisters maddie and lily how did we get here well it started with few strong americans my great grandmother mildred was a single mom which was tough thankfully she was strong and independent and wasnt afraid to state her opinions even when women werent supposed to be heard from
8514460 the important thing to come out of the convention is barack obamas message
8514461 this is the reality we are facing our concern is that consumers buying power is decreasing
8514462 if this situation continues long term it would affect sony
8514463 sony would like to address the needs of this drastically expanding market to establish a leading position
8514464 police will use a softened stance to deal with the protesters
8514465 we will give them time to leave the government house but if they continue to defy the court order then we have to use force to drive them out i cannot set the precise time or deadline for this
8514466 if we get arrested please dont follow us to the detention center
8514467 we want our network to be transparent and do what it is supposed to do we dont want to have to pay attention to it our customers have to catch planes
8514468 our new mpls network is the centerpiece of inmotions strategic initiative for investing in technology so we can both grow and offer an excellent customer experience
8514469 by managing inmotions private network new edge networks becomes an extension of inmotions it staff this frees them to focus on other strategic it activities for supporting a business that spreads across four time zones
8514470 one of the reasons we selected new edge networks is because they seem to better understand the nuances of dealing with airports and their security restrictions installers cant just walk through security check points with screwdrivers and expect to get in and get out quickly its a tough environment to work in
8514471 instead of watching true canadian programming such as the pierre berton documentary the long and boring history of railroad tracks canadians were watching non canadian shows such as the beverly hillbillies
8514472 its not really a concern for me as a consumer
8514473 who cares what the crtc say s it just doesnt matter
8514474 the government has no more mandate to promote culture than it does religion
8514475 does that mean anyone can attack it and its up to the church or its parishioners to defend it
8514476 a leading source of radical homosexual propaganda anti christian bigotry and radical transgender advocacy

8514483 afghanistan we dont read about it anymore in the papers because it succeeded
8514484 we need to send 2 more combat battalions to afghanistan
8514485 america finally beginning to come to grips with the complexity of the racial issues that have beleaguered us for so long
8514486 one of the all time matches that ive seen here
8514487 it really is a commentary however it turns out however you feel about his candidacy about america finally beginning to come to grips with the complexity of the racial issues that have beleaguered us for so long
8514488 i never thought in my lifetime that a major party would nominate an african american
8514489 if you remember one of the elegant notions of the bush campaign was you dont need to respond to every crisis by intervening abroad
8514490 chokes off the informed question and often even informed debate
8514491 the goal of many of the political handlers of this era is to make consent as uninformed as possible
8514492 seek out the un telegenic correspondents the crustier they are the more likely they are to know the score
8514493 of course you watch and i probably read the text too
8514494 this week and next you get a sense of who the candidates are its an important moment they set the tone and tenor of the rest of the campaign i just sit and watch as somebody whos an american citizen
8514495 he had this great ability to make everyone feel good
8514496 he toyed with the idea of law school and also becoming a big musician
8514497 he had the ability to reach out and relate to anyone because he had so many interests
8514498 you could always learn something from him because he had a wide range of things to talk about he was a genius in many ways
8514499 he was the sort of friend you hope to have and the person you hope to be
8514500 i am blessed to have known him for 21 years
8514501 joe biden is what so many pretend to be a statesman
8514502 we always have students tell us they want to help with the demands of jobs and courses
8514503 were hoping that by providing a scheduled program students will be able to participate without being pressured by other commitments
8514504 i would have loved to talk to a peer who had already had some experience in spain
8514505 there so many little things to address like where to get money or where to find the best food
8514506 going to spain and actually experiencing the culture is so much better than just reading about it
8514507 it helped my foreign language skills and broadened my worldview
8514508 i know theres a cadre of students who are ready to volunteer were hoping to have many more students in pal
8514509 we want a broader range of students to be available
8514510 it makes sense to have students giving advice to other students
8514511 hearing from someone who is in college and around my age makes it easier to relate im not sure where im going to study abroad but its good to know someone has already been there and done that
8514512 these students clearly saw an opportunity to share their knowledge and experience it will give students an opportunity to tell stories and show pictures
8514513 it will allow them to meet with students in various stages of their experience
8514514 the idea is that a person can type in their schedule where they live whether they prefer to ride with smokers or non smokers and other information after which commutesmart finds other people with similar schedules and preferences and bridges the gap that allows for communication among them
8514515 as a result people end up saving money on gas while also helping the environment
8514516 commutesmart tries to give its participants a level of comfort that most other carpool options dont offer
8514517 the mental stress is relieved it really brings it close to home
8514518 i know someone who spent almost 6 000 a year on gas
8514519 the environmental issue is devastating now for people to change old habits something else has to change first the price of gas did just that
8514520 its difficult for us to change but there comes a point when the pain is greater by not making minor changes like these
8514521 so far the program has been well received and in the next few years this program can really make a great difference on the university
8514522 itll be war related poetry absolutely but i am not at all here to take any political stances not at all here to make any points not trying to convince anyone of anything not trying to change any minds im trying to open up a discussion and im going to come at people with different viewpoints
8514523 they saw me there and liked how animated i was liked my style and then asked me to do this over the summer just start thinking about things i could do and i got pumped and excited and of course said yes
8514524 im going to be using the show as a base point for what im doing and incorporating the themes into what im saying
8514525 its about soldiers and just the general public at larges reaction to world war ii vietnam and the current war in iraq and kenny in his show takes on different roles he has different soldiers he has different civilians with opinions
8514526 its all going to be freestyle i might have some outlines in my head of where i want to go but i have nothing written down its all off the top of my head
8514527 s p i r i t is basically funded only by the students and all the money 100 percent of it goes to first in family scholarships
8514528 any support you can get when youre a first generation student is nice
8514529 with everything so expensive these days any small difference is huge
8514530 it is really the best way on campus for students to help students
8514531 every bit of the proceeds goes right into the scholarship fund
8514532 students are able to donate money from their action cards which is a much simpler process for everyone
8514533 it truly never has been easier for the student body to make a difference in the lives of our fellow students
8514534 i think the s p i r i t campaign is the perfect example of how the students government is here when you need us
8514535 with the current economic times we could all use some extra help and we are encouraging all students to spare what they can to help each other out
8514536 mommy why does daddy have to hurt all the time

8514538 there is a handful of women that are in the lounge spaces in tutwiler
8514539 the community director is already in the process of communicating with those women moving them
8514540 at least two that im aware of have elected to stay their room is set up and they have it exactly where they want but the community director is in the process of communicating with all of them about relocating or staying or dividing up if they were not with chosen roommates she is working to get them into permanent spaces
8514541 last year we had no one stay in the lounge spaces beyond just a couple of weeks
8514542 well need to make a decision at some point this fall
8514543 i think its a great solution but we want to give it a little bit of time to make sure thats true
8514544 we estimate that 80 to 85 percent of the students who live on campus bring a vehicle to campus

8514551 as far as the market manager is concerned its kind of an agreement between the buyer and seller
8514552 none of our vendors want to do anything that is illegal or against the law
8514553 we want this to truly be in every sense of the term a hands on learning experience for the children
8514554 we live in a society that focuses too much on worksheets and tests and not enough on actual hands on experiences and thats what were trying to achieve for these children hands on learning
8514555 if you come out here and express an interest youre going to be used
8514556 this program has got to be appreciated and taken advantage of because we depend on volunteers anyone who loves children is welcomed and we will accommodate you

8514571 tuscaloosa is a great college town but it is also a great family town and momma goldbergs deli is a tremendous college restaurant and a great family one too
8514572 we thought it would be an opportunity for us to do something for the city for not only the working moms and dads but also for the students because it is a great value and its high quality food at a low price
8514573 you found a baby in a basket on your doorstep 20 years ago i am the adoptive father of that baby girl i am in australia on a visit and ill drop in tomorrow
8514574 the advent of the gregorian rite and the appearance of a high ranking cardinal swathed in yards of red silk at westminster cathedral has made me wonder whether the holy father longs for the ecclesial certainty of his pre conciliar bavarian childhood
8514575 getting ahead of the next guy is not always the best solution
8514576 because of the number of drivers at the university the class can only help
8514577 recognize that you have the ability to react the right way in those times
8514578 people recognize that obama may be a charming person but he does not have the experience or leadership to lead this country at this critical time with regards to the economy or foreign policy and he just isnt ready to lead america
8514579 i think theyll recognize in john mccain that we have someone who will strengthen the economy who will do whatever it takes to get us off foreign oil and will keep america safe
8514580 you dont get bumps in politics the way you used to in part because of what were seeing right here with the media
8514581 theres so much politics that bumps just dont occur anymore like the old days where you had a spurt of new coverage and new energy then people responded
8514582 those bumps dont exist anymore i dont think youre going to see a bump out of the convention i dont think youre going to see a bump out of the republican convention its something of the past

8514601 well malstrom you want the answers to the viral messaging
8514602 nintendo has an advantage of doing well with young demographics unlike its competitors therefore turn that success into a failure by labeling nintendo as kiddy
8514603 nintendo has an amazing motion controller its competitors do not call this awesome innovation as gimmick so we can turn that strength into a weakness
8514604 we wish we had the first party strength of nintendo since we cant we will try to turn it into a weakness we then proclaim that third party games dont sell on nintendo
8514605 working isnt in gods plan for me hell find a way to pay our bills while my husband works his ass off and our children starve women shouldnt work

8514607 we get it now go into the bostak corporation and kick some bug ass
8514608 if i get arrested for stealing a tank ill never be able to sell a lemon to an old lady again
8514609 i know im going out into the wild blue yonder just remember this if ever a bug needs to be killed ill be there i am harry reider the bugman
8514610 the game has changed and the way the game is played has to be changed
8514611 we now have the complete bow equipment quiver and arrows
8514612 and we have surprisingly a lot of organic material like leather parts of shoes and a trouser leg that we wouldnt normally find
8514613 what we do know is that the climate has fluctuated throughout history in the past the driving force for the changes was the earths orbital pattern now the driving force is green house gas emissions
8514614 if leather is exposed to the weather to sun wind and rain it disintegrates almost immediately the fact that we still find these 5 000 year old pieces of leather tells us they were protected by the ice all this time and that the glaciers have never been smaller than in the year 2003 and the years following
8514615 up to then we had always thought the alps were not used that people never went there
8514616 these failures were a cause of the accident which resulted in the death of daniel burman
8514617 it hit the ground the impact had a catapult effect
8514618 burman fell out of his harness because he was not wearing it properly he fell approximately ten metres to the ground and died almost instantly
8514619 it would be to my knowledge the largest penalty ever imposed by a court in this jurisdiction and a significant penalty in the country for offences of this type
8514620 i expect that these breaches of the act are not at the top of the range nevertheless they are serious matters
8514621 there are id procedures that need to take place and they could all be jeopardised if his name or description is released at this stage
8514622 establish that the accused was not entitled to the amounts that he claimed and received as the result of his dishonest conduct
8514623 it is incumbent on the prosecution to do this in order to establish to the necessary degree that the accused had an intent to defraud when he forged and uttered the documents in support of his claims
8514624 in the circumstances it is not necessary to make any finding as to whether or not the accused had an honest belief that he was entitled to claim as he did
8514625 for these reasons i conclude that while the accused acted dishonestly in making the claims that he did it has not been established that he did so with the necessary intent to defraud
8514626 accordingly in due course there will be a judgment of acquittal in respect of each of the charges
8514627 im very pleased its been a very significant toll on myself and my family
8514628 its cost me a million dollars in financial costs and an unbelievable toll in personal and psychological costs

8514634 twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didnt do than by the ones you did do so throw off the bowlines sail away from the safe harbor catch the trade winds in your sails explore dream discover
8514635 nothing is as real as a dream the world can change around you but your dream will not responsibilities need not erase it duties need not obscure it because the dream is within you no one can take it away
8514636 mishaps are like knives that either serve us or cut us as we grasp them by the blade or the handle
8514637 whatever you do you need courage whatever course you decide upon there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong there are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe your critics are right to map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs peace has its victories but it takes brave men and women to win them

8514649 kata ketua komisi dakwah majelis ulama indonesia kh nuril huda di jakarta menurutnya kebiasaan shalat tarawih sebanyak 23 rakaat sering menjadi penyebab kurang diperhatikannya rukun tertibn dalam menjalankan shalat adahal tertib merupakan bagian yang tidak dipisahkan dari rukun shalat nuril mencontohkan seharusnya shalat itu disempurnakan setiap gerakannya misalnya dalam hal ruku harus sampai lurus dan selesaikan bacaannya karena mengejar waktu maka hal itu tidak dilakukan dengan sempurna

8514675 the moratorium is an important first step and an opportunity for the local government forest communities and other stakeholders to improve forest governance
8514676 the indonesian government should declare a national moratorium on forest conversion to bring a halt to the vicious cycle of peatland drainage forest fires and resulting biodiversity loss due to forest destruction

8514711 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8514712 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8514713 it was awesome this is the speech that will unite the party
8514714 he hit all the right notes he told america why john mccain should not be president why john mccain is the same as bush
8514715 they took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt
8514716 from over 22 million new jobs down to 5 million from an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 1 2 million falling into poverty
8514717 barack obama knows that america cant be strong abroad unless we are first strong at home
8514718 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8514719 on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8514720 barack obama will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope
8514721 so if you like me believe that america must always be a place called hope then join hillary and chelsea and me in making barack obama the next president of the united states

8514728 it was only when the wind blew and it began twisting and flying back and forth that it became apparent that it appeared to be a body
8514729 what it looks like is a parachutist has come through the canopy and got caught and just stayed there in an upright position
8514730 it is completely covered in moss it is only because of the shape of it and the aluminium and cabling that makes it look like a body at all other than that it looks like branches of a tree and still may very well be

8514736 it is my hope that setting primary source texts from the devastating week in 2005 when katrina hit will help us keep this time active in our memory challenging us to cut through the spin that followed and bringing us closer to an understanding of the true aftermath new orleans has long been a musical epicenter and a real crossroads of culture the musical influences present in katrina ballads are plentiful and diverse in that sense this work is a tribute to the life of music and its ability to shape and inspire us

8514748 new orleans has experienced a profound change in who governs schools and a dramatic reduction of parent and local taxpayer control of schools
8514749 50 of them are charter schools privatized management governed by self appointed self perpetuating boards 33 are run by the state department of education through the recovery school district and only five are governed by the elected school board
8514750 there are now 42 separate school systems operating in new orleans
8514751 school policies including teacher requirements curriculum discipline policies enrollment limits and social promotions publicly accountable schools in which parents have methods for publicly redressing grievances are limited to only five schools 5 6 of the total
8514752 but the people down here need the world to understand that its still a tragic situation the rent has tripled the health care system is in shambles we have less access to education for our kids the working class and poor are being exploited while everyone at the top is getting fat off our misery

8514758 august 29th will forever be remembered in this region as the day that changed millions of lives we are working as one community to restore our beloved city and all the richness of its culture but in the midst of this historic undertaking to move toward a better future we cannot and must not forget those who lost their lives in the storms and floods it is in this spirit of reflection that we continue to move with great determination to secure the resources and funding needed to fully rebuild our city
8514759 on this third anniversary of hurricanes katrina and rita we come together as one community to remember those who lost their lives and reflect upon the progress we have made
8514760 three years after the devastation of these storms our citizens continue to move forward rebuilding their neighborhoods and communities although we have made great strides in our recovery efforts there is still much to do we will continue to do whatever it takes to fully rebuild this great city that we call home
8514761 lets forget this mans sacrifice for his country and his proven leadership abilities and talk some more about change
8514762 we want to play with the best and to do that we had to qualify for the group stage it was a big mental test
8514763 the whole team was sharper and physically much better than on saturday and that is why it made it easier
8514764 he brings calm and confidence to the side and overall we had a good balance in the side
8514765 cesc could have stayed on he always wants to play but he was probably more disappointed that they did not have a go at us
8514766 i have always said we have to be patient with him
8514767 i felt he can be decisive in any game against anybody if we can get him in
8514768 he has improved his first touch and his link up play which was vital for his progression
8514769 but the way he finished his goal you cannot teach that he has that naturally
8514770 you can see many transfers announced in the media every day but it takes a lot of time and does not always happen
8514771 i was sat here yesterday and they were talking about a crisis at arsenal someone said it was the best time to play them after they lost to fulham but it was the worst time
8514772 we are hurt and disappointed its not how we expect twente to play we must take that anger into saturdays match when the season starts
8514773 arsenal are further on than us they have played premier league games and it showed they were fitter and stronger than they were two weeks ago
8514774 we played with belief and competed with them in the first leg we didnt do that today
8514775 its been a great experience for the players they are a young team and they need these experiences to learn
8514776 we are in the uefa cup the season starts on saturday and there is still a lot to play for

8514785 the decision to increase parking fees has not been made lightly however upon reviewing the unsustainable costs of providing car parking at the current rates we had no alternative but to reduce the multi million dollar subsidy the university is paying towards parking for next year
8514786 while the university acknowledges and appreciates that some students and staff may be upset by the necessary increase it is unsustainable for uws to continue to subsidise parking by more than 8 million a year money which can be better spent to grow essential areas like our teaching and learning programs and facilities and other student services
8514787 the university was founded on equity and access and the latest increase in parking fees flies in the face of that and makes it harder for the disadvantaged
8514788 one in eight university students skip regular meals and now they will have to decide what they spend their money on meals or parking
8514789 we have had more than 20 students booked after being directed to park in the overflow

8514826 georgia is of strategic importance because we have access through georgia through a pipeline that runs from baku the capital of azerbaijan through tbilisi the capital of georgia down to turkey and to the mediterranean ocean a pipeline which gives us access to the oil and soon also the gas that lies not only in azerbaijan but beyond it in the caspian sea and beyond it in central asia so in that sense its a major and very important strategic asset to us
8514827 we have been optimistic on it for the last six seven months and even at these levels we are recently bullish on the it stocks especially looking at the way the rupee is slipping i think it has to be on the positive for the it space and it is a best defensive bet at this point of time when the market is not moving anywhere i think one needs to get invested in these stocks because most of these largecap funds stocks like infosys or satyam or tata consultancy services tcs should at least return 20 25 from these levels over the next six nine months
8514828 at the cmp of rs 388 the stock is trading at 5 1x and 3 7x its fy09e and fy10e consensus earnings respectively and significantly lower to its nav of rs 632 per share as on june 2008 showing a limited downside to the stock we believe the asset prices to further improve in fy09 and offshore business to fetch better returns contributing nearly 19 to the revenue by fy10e thus we give an outperformer rating on the stock with a price target of rs 462 average of 4xfy10e and 20 discount to nav as huge capacity is being lined up and strong growth is expected in shipping and offshore segments
8514829 punj lloyd had a move of its lows from about rs 220 230 now its sort of consolidating between rs 260 300 in case it can take this rs 300 level out then you would be probably looking at levels of rs 360 this is also quite closely correlated to the metal prices so as long as metal prices fall there is a good chance that these midcap capital goods type of companies are likely to move higher
8514830 if metal prices become rangebound then you are looking at broadly a rangebound kind of move as you were saying everything is kind of coming rangebound and low volumish so i am not too optimistic on capital goods as yet
8514831 we are more or less close to the top because the way the sugar prices have moved in the recent past i think it is already there in the prices of sugar stocks so the upside from here is quite limited but again if one is looking at next possibly 15 18 months then yes one should be buying sugar stocks at lower levels for a stock like balrampur chini possibly the downside from here is not more than around rs 80 82 so if it comes closer to those levels one should buy at those levels with a view that it could go to around rs 130 140 over the next 15 18 months
8514832 but fertilizers again it is more of a cyclical sort of a place so the best is already over for the time being but we will have to wait for the next cycle to begin which possibly could be another six nine months away
8514833 sasken is in a very narrow range between rs 140 to about rs 160 its important to remember that it came off a low of about rs 100 so given that and the way rupee is shaping up if it can take rs 160 out it could again have another sharp rally towards rs 210 215
8514834 polaris its been in a range of rs 65 to about rs 115 if rs 115 can be taken out if some of these deal talk comes back and rupee weakens some more probably that kind of trigger would lead polaris to a higher trading range which could be rs 115 120 to about rs 160 so midcap technology is sort of acting like a defensive or is stronger than the rest of the market

8514839 there isnt a ddg 51 today that comes off of the production ways with bmd capability for example thats an upgrade to existing ddg 51s
8514840 when they get through the next phase of that i think the navy plan is to have like 15 destroyers which have what you would call rudimentary bmd but those are upgrades as opposed to a standard package coming off the production way so there is some knowledge there that needs to be looked at with a little bit finer tooth comb
8514841 there really is no comparisons in capability between a dbr and a spy 1d either from a concurrency perspective in other words how many phases can be in operation and how many modes at one time or in just the capability to command the missile which is in the other end of the spectrum in the sm 3 standard missile mode

8514850 did you see a difference when we started to investigate
8514851 we certainly at that time started to receive much more communication with cummins at the corporate level
8514852 the timing has nothing to do with anyone putting pressure on us to get it done
8514853 weve expressed to them is that its not a time for us to have any fewer emergency vehicles is when you have that type of event occurring in the denver metro area

8514874 at around rs 2 150 reliance industries is a decent long term buy but again i surely do not expect much of an upper movement at least in short term i think the upside is capped to possibly around rs 2 250 2 275 but if one can hold on for a slightly longer term whatever issues are there as of now one should be hopeful that by december january things would be much clearer than what it is right now so possibly post that i suppose we could see levels of closer to around rs 2 700 2 800

8514901 i have some suspicions and i know of a couple of cases of people who have actually fallen off trolleys but id like to follow it up and double check to make sure what actually happened to them long term
8514902 pressure areas occur people dont get fed properly and get sleep deprived because being in an emergency department our lights are on 24 hours a day seven days a week and they dont get good sleep
8514903 one of the ways that may be delivered is by dropping elective surgery in certain areas for a short period of time

8514905 in the west we know washington is broken and barack obama is the change we need its bad enough that john mccain and my opponent steve pearce have supported every one of george bushs special interest economic policies
8514906 i have amended my previous order from last night we will not disperse the protests he said citing the court decision
8514907 i ask the protest leaders to give themselves up to police i assign police to do this task without dispersing the rally but that doesnt mean the government will let it go on forever he said
8514908 its up to them the court has already ordered their dispersal i want to reassure all thai people that there will be no spark

8514921 one thing jesus asks of me that i lean on him that in him and only in him i put complete trust that i surrender myself to him unreservedly even when all goes wrong and i feel as if i am a ship without a compass i must give myself completely to him i must not attempt to control gods action i must not count the stages in the journey he would have me make i must not desire a clear perception of my advance upon the road must not know precisely where i am upon the way of holiness i ask him to make a saint of me yet i must leave to him the choice of the saintliness itself and still more the means which leads to it

8514925 senator mccain who once railed against the smears of karl rove when he was the target has morphed into candidate mccain who is using the same rove tactics and the same rove staff to repeat the same old politics of fear and smear

8514927 should we trust john mccains judgment when he said only three years ago afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded

8514941 although the market is showing some initial signs of firming premium rates it is not expected that substantial rate increases will occur across all business lines in the short term
8514942 in this environment and with some uncertainty over the extent of an economic slow down in australia it is expected that growth excluding acquisitions will again be fairly modest over the 2009 financial year
8514943 additional profit growth will depend on the successful completion of a number of smaller acquisitions that austbrokers is currently considering

8514953 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8514954 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8514955 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8514956 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8514957 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8514958 the high humidity and the cooler temperatures helped the firefighters
8514959 la baisse du pouvoir dachat a un impact r el

8514961 un taux de ch mage diff rent par r gion peut sans doute expliquer cette perception
8514962 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8514963 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8514964 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8514965 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8514966 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8514967 this can be seen from the number of laws that forbid any favouritism to its own citizens
8514968 who wont allow workers from certain countries to work in france
8514969 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8514970 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8514971 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8514972 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8514973 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8514974 soon after relocating to this office there was a flood at the wash that national television stations covered
8514975 floods havent affected the business but they are inconvenient for our employees
8514976 progress is moving along but we had a lot of rain
8514977 we had to give six weeks more to the contractor altogether we are 60 days behind schedule
8514978 the city of scottsdale is investing money to build a bridge crossing the wash because we need a major arterial to move traffic smoothly and efficiently
8514979 well try to do everything we can outside the wash area while the road is flooded
8514980 theres no reason to believe we will go over budget
8514981 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8514982 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8514983 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8514984 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8514985 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8514986 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8514987 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8514988 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8514989 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8514990 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8514991 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8514992 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8514993 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8514994 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8514995 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

8514997 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8514998 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8514999 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8515000 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8515001 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8515002 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8515003 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8515004 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8515005 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8515006 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8515007 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8515008 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8515009 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8515010 who are open to doing something on the production side
8515011 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8515012 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8515013 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8515014 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8515015 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8515016 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8515017 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8515018 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8515019 the general nature of the boards travel policies have allowed for excessive or imprudent expenses to go unquestioned
8515020 this is a very eye opening report for me to see and shocking in some respects
8515021 almost everything in the report and all the recommendations are reasonable common sense things that should be in our policy
8515022 we always welcome an extra set of eyes to look at what we do and how we do it
8515023 if we can improve from that thats a good thing
8515024 saya naik saksi atas nama allah bahawa isteri saya melakukan zina
8515025 saya naik saksi atas nama allah anak yang dikandung bukan daripada benih saya
8515026 saya bersaksi kepada allah kandungan ini daripada benih suami saya
8515027 bahawa suami saya berdusta dan kemurkaan allah ke atas saya jika suami saya bercakap benar
8515028 orang yang menuduh isterinya dengan berzina tetapi mereka tiada mempunyai saksi kecuali dirinya sendiri maka kesaksiannya ialah empat kali bersumpah dengan allah bahawa ia seorang yang benar dan yang kelima laknat allah atas dirinya jika ia dusta hukuman tertolak daripada isteri jika ia bersumpah empat kali dengan allah bahawa suaminya dusta dan yang kelima bahawa kemurkaan allah atas dirinya jika suaminya yang benar
8515029 jika seseorang perempuan yang berkahwin dengan seorang lelaki melahirkan seorang anak lebih daripada enam bulan qamariah daripada tarikh perkahwinannya atau dalam masa empat tahun qamariah selepas perkahwinannya dibubarkan sama ada oleh sebab kematian lelaki itu atau sebab perceraian dan perempuan itu pula tidak berkahwin semula maka lelaki itu hendaklah disifatkan sebagai bapa anak itu tetapi lelaki itu boleh dengan cara lian atau kutukan menafikan anak itu sebagai anaknya di hadapan mahkamah

8515033 it appears poor contract standards and deficient oversight have become the accepted norm for doing business
8515034 do we need to change the statutes and tell counties how to operate their jails

8515049 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8515050 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8515051 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8515052 informar aos delegados e aos l deres dos dois partidos as inquieta es da comunidade hisp nica j que o caminho casa branca tanto para o senador barack obama como para o senador john mccain passa pelo voto latino

8515058 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8515059 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8515060 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8515061 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8515073 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8515074 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

8515153 it is not up to the player to decide when he ends his international career a player whether he is 35 or 18 will be selected it is not up to him to decide it is my decision
8515154 there is no law that allows him to decide to stop there can be a consultation a meeting a discussion an agreement but in no case can there be a decree by one of the parties
8515155 makelele has received a pre call just like about 50 other players
8515156 if he is good there is no reason for me to put him on the side
8515157 competition and his age can make you believe there are other attractive solutions in the future but now if we need an experienced player to help balance the team i remain the man who makes the decision
8515158 with keke we have had talks for four years every month he told me coach i want to stop i replied yes we will talk later come next week and we will talk again he said at my age i will not be able to but he is always happy to get called again

8515188 but his kicker in defense of what he seems to presume is ditkos creative naivete is no comics professional in the 1950s could have envisioned that the industry would spawn a knock off showbiz stuffed with quasi celebrity excuse me while its probable no one thought it very likely the 50s is exactly when the superman tv show was chewing up the airwaves so it mustve occurred to somebody that other comics properties might be developed into media productions and it was no secret to anybody that comics was a business where knock offs were more common than torn up betting slips at a race track its a business built on knock offs
8515189 meanwhile ditkos reward has been scraps from the tables of companies that he personally enriched and forty years of incessant second guessing by his so called fans by other professionals by his editors and by his critics how could he leave spider man why are these new comics so preachy why doesnt he sell his original artwork why doesnt he want to meet his public and that last question contains a barb of its own no comics professional in the 1950s could have envisioned that the industry would spawn a knock off showbiz stuffed with quasi celebrity creators from later eras whove been cagey on the point of their own weak fame should be considered at best disingenuous no one who entered the industry after say 1980 can reasonably or honestly say that they didnt expect what they got but with ditkos generation and generations previous this sentiment is completely true most of these men viewed themselves im sure as artists or at least artisans but none signed a faustian bargain with the american fame machine
8515190 kobek gets downright goofy on a couple of points like his initial thrust that nobody in the comics business not jack kirby or siegel amp shuster has been as
8515191 concurrent with editorial disputes was ditkos fight with lee and goodman over promised royalties and monies from merchandising that were beginning to pour in near the end of ditkos tenure even more vexing was marvels move into television the cartoon programs heading to the airwaves were based on the artists previously published work and ditkos peers kirby and don heck were also complaining vociferously goodman was constantly putting off both kirby and ditko and the artists became incensed but robert beerbohm a comics storeowner in the late 1960s and early fanzine producer got an earful a high school buddy steve johnson and i spoke with steve ditko by phone a couple of times back in 1969 ditko told us point blank that he left marvel over promised percentage royalties based on sales and merchandise if the books took off steve started making noise about the extra dough so did jack they were told that the company was still not making enough and to wait promised contracts never seemed to be completed to be signed or were carefully verbal in nature

8515196 on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8515197 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8515198 like millions of americans theyre asking questions as profound as they are ordinary
8515199 it was because i was so bright i couldnt get the thoughts out quickly enough
8515200 she told me joey god sends no cross you cannot bear and when i triumphed she was quick to remind me it was because of others
8515201 i think michelle obama kicked it off pretty well dont you think
8515202 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house down last night
8515203 someone who reminds us what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first thank you president clinton
8515204 some days i feel like sh t some days i wanna quit and just be normal for a bit
8515205 our state is better prepared than it has been before to respond to a major disaster
8515206 we have supplies preposition but people need to make their own plans as well now is the time to make sure you have gas in the car food and prescriptions
8515207 theres buses theres drivers theres planes theres trains theres a whole different strategy for getting people out starting with the people who have special medical needs
8515208 if a minister embezzles or carries out any act of corruption would you hold the president liable the president is not responsible for a ministers mistake
8515209 as a liberator you are questioning me when you should be happy about my role
8515210 if we had not fought to get charles taylor out of your backs you wouldnt be sitting here today to be called trc
8515211 at least a monument could be built for sekou demate conneh as a liberator i would enjoy that
8515212 it is because of these lies and denials that this country truly needs a war crimes court
8515213 these are lies pure lies we were all here and we saw the carnage and mayhem lurd unleashed on armless and defenseless civilians
8515214 i think the convention has gone pretty well so far what do you think
8515215 my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8515216 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8515217 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8515218 reminded us of what its like when you actually put people first
8515219 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8515220 i am glad to be back after a decade i really feel vindicated i feel great
8515221 second political tsunami the government is a titanic that will sink
8515222 anwar whatever we think of him and many of us are deeply sceptical is looking more and more like our future prime minister
8515223 there is a mounting sense of inevitability to his impending succession
8515224 clearly the prime minister has lost the mandate of the country
8515225 we cannot afford to have a weak leadership because it could lead to our downfall
8515226 some of the players were feeling flat due to the amount of rugby they have played
8515227 theres a few guys who played each and every minute of the super 14 and most of the test matches too you can see they are a bit flat and the decision making is just not there
8515228 you cant speak for the opposition but where were at were all feeling fresh
8515229 it is a tough and intense competition but i think weve got the balance right and the guys do feel fresh they are looking forward to training and looking forward to games i havent experienced that flatness
8515230 one of our biggest strengths is the impact our bench has been giving to the team
8515231 weve got a squad of 30 the whole squad trains and everyone gets an opportunity to train in their position and everyone gets equal time in their positions
8515232 i think that certainly has a positive effect when the interchange players come on they feel comfortable in their roles they just go out and want to play good football and thats what theyve been doing
8515233 previously in a lot of teams youd probably focus on the starting xv making sure they get enough time in their positions but now everyone is getting that equal time and equal opportunity and that is certainly paying dividends for us
8515234 the good thing is that the guys are always prepared to come on in the first minute or the 58th minute
8515235 we knew it was a difficult team to play against
8515236 they played good on counterattack it was difficult but we were playing better than in the first leg
8515237 our players earned this victory this is a big day for us its like we won the champions league tonight
8515238 when it was 0 0 at half time it was looking good for us
8515239 we couldnt stay calm and that hurt us this is a difficult moment for us
8515240 we knew theyd dig in defensively we couldnt get past that wall

8515283 es hora de que los arque logos empiecen a buscar otras razones por las que los neandertales se extinguieron mientras que nuestros antepasados sobrevivieron tecnol gicamente no hay ventajas claras de unas herramientas frente a otras

8515297 hey america im paris hilton and i am a celebrity too
8515298 bisher haben wir keinen grund von unserem ausblick abzur cken aber es ist etwas schwerer geworden die ziele zu erreichen

8515300 wir haben das ziel unseren derzeitigen marktanteil von ber 10 langfristig mindestens zu halten
8515301 the reduced forcing might compensate or over compensate for the effects of the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases
8515302 it is likely that there will be a cessation of around 20 years in the increase in world temperature or possibly a decrease by 0 1 degrees or more
8515303 natural solar variability is potentially important but the climate history and physics tell us that the probability of this factor sufficiently cooling the planet to offset the enhanced greenhouse effect is distinctly remote
8515304 i have never seen a credible paper published using a climate model that shows this
8515305 i believe that we must state firmly that a cooling is possible in the near future but that the warming would then resume 10 20 years hence
8515306 it will be very hard to argue for public trust if we say nothing about the possibility and then try to argue our way out after it happens using an aussie rules analogy that would be like giving the climate sceptics a free kick 10m in front of goal
8515307 la gente dice con frecuencia que la f sica es una ciencia de la materia o del mundo material pero sin embargo muchos libros de f sica te rica contienen grandes cantidades de matem ticas y algunos no mencionan en absoluto la materia esto es as porque la f sica se desarrolla construyendo modelos matem ticos del mundo para confrontarlos entonces con los resultados emp ricos se puede pensar que el mundo visto por la f sica moderna est construido no de materia sino m s bien de matem ticas pero la matem tica es la ciencia de las estructuras
8515308 la matem tica por descontado trata con estructuras mucho m s complejas por ejemplo espacios vectoriales algebras espacios euclidianos o riemanianos y otras cosas semejantes los f sicos toman algunas de estas estructuras y las interpretan como estructuras del mundo por ejemplo dicen que el espacio tiempo de nuestro mundo es un espacio riemaniano cuatridimensional es un m todo muy potente ve el mundo a trav s del cristal de las estructuras en este sentido la f sica no es una ciencia de la materia sino m s bien una ciencia de las estructuras este punto de vista se llama filosof a estructuralista de la f sica no s lo la he desarrollado en mis art culos filos ficos sino que trato de hacer ciencia y ense arla en el esp ritu de esta filosof a

8515354 angesichts der herausforderung der unsere branche wegen der extrem gestiegenen treibstoffkosten gegen bersteht sind wir mit dem ergebnis des ersten halbjahres zufrieden vor allem auch deshalb weil sich gezeigt hat dass wir mit unserem auf breiter basis stehenden gesch ftsmodell gut aufgestellt sind

8515360 theres bound to be a few surprises a person puts his or her best foot forward at the beginning ive got to wait a while to find out who this person really is
8515361 is not the noble youth very like a well bred dog in respect of guarding and watching
8515362 he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only by the criterion of knowing and not knowing
8515363 he who is likely to be gentle to his friends and acquaintances must by nature be a lover of wisdom
8515364 he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the state will require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and strength

8515367 were happy with the verdict but its a shame this should have been limited to one death
8515368 he should have had the courage and the guts to kill himself before killing anyone else
8515369 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8515370 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty

8515374 she doesnt believe her sister intentionally did anything to her child
8515375 she is not physically capable of having committed those acts

8515377 she wants this to be over she wants to be vindicated
8515378 this is whats happening to you your baby this month
8515379 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8515380 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8515381 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8515382 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8515383 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8515384 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all
8515385 transparency trust and control with respect to the sites they visit
8515386 if ie8 helps heighten awareness of this value exchange thats a step in the right direction

8515394 senator barack obama has received considerably more contributions from members of the u s military in both number and amount than senator john mccain and this despite mccains war record and image as a booster of the armed forces
8515395 the real lesson here is that a significant portion of the u s military believes that obama would be a better steward of the armed forces than mccain
8515396 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states

8515399 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8515400 grazie al loro impegno alla dedizione dei giovani ed alla certezza delle posizioni tenute dal partito
8515401 che lunione di centro ha potuto riscuoter consensi senza rimaner schiacciata fra le due grandi coalizioni elettorali pdl lega e pd idv mantenendo quindi una significativa rappresentanza parlamentare la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori siamo consci che nel periodo in cui viviamo i veti pregiudiziali e lostruzionismo allazione di governo siano deleteri per un paese che cerca di risollevarsi testimonianza ne la presenza in aula dei nostri parlamentari a garanzia del numero legale per un corretto svolgimento dei lavori di contro votar a scatola chiusa i disegni di legge presentati significherebbe allinearsi su posizioni che non ci appartengono e sulle quali nutriamo forti perplessit

8515404 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8515405 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8515406 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8515408 da tempo ludc aveva posto lattenzione sulle aree agricole e sul censimento delle stesse
8515409 e stata necessaria la violenza su i due turisti olandesi per capire che a roma sono centinaia le strutture ex agricole abbandonate e occupate da clandestini e da persone senza fissa dimora

8515444 hoy tenemos contratos de u s3 600 la tonelada de leche en polvo cuando hace dos meses est bamos en u s4 800 y eso quit expectativa
8515445 no quiere decir que no haya tambos chicos que tienen costos de alrededor de ese precio pero all hay otras herramientas

8515451 this is a show cause notice and we have sought comments from the secretary of the health ministry and the aiims director on a complaint filed with the nhrc
8515452 we are seeking the nhrcs intervention because we have no faith in any internal inquiry by the institute
8515453 we want to clarify that none of the deaths was due to the medication or interventions used in clinical trials
8515454 clinical research is the mandate of the aiims clinicians novel therapies are examined keeping in mind the utmost safety for all patients
8515455 the research protocol undergoes intense scrutiny by the internationally recognised institute ethics committee written informed consent is taken from parents and guardians
8515456 it was a test of their character and they have come out on top their achievement is significant and highly appreciable
8515457 there is a huge talent in boxing here indian boxers are as good as any in the world technique wise they are second to none what they need is more facilities and opportunities to fight at the highest level
8515458 the best thing about the boxers is that they compete to win they are capable of beating the best in the world
8515459 there is some structure allright but thats not enough if the boxers have to realise their full potential injuries are not taken seriously because of the lack of awareness what they do not realise is that minor injuries could become career threatening
8515460 there has to be a corporate government synergy and the common objective should be to help athletes perform better there should be a coordinated effort
8515461 he was adamant on getting back into the ring and that gave him the inner strength to recover faster
8515462 managers sometimes take performance in past set ups and try to estimate what will happen in a new setting by interpolation
8515463 you cant steer these things like you can a bus

8515465 i was inspired by the similarity between fluid flows and how people walk around obstacles

8515471 he understands the cash it generates mikes a power player for having sweet talked the city into letting the tents stay in bryant park for the foreseeable future
8515472 we consider the hurricane to be a potential direct threat to the state of texas
8515473 we have a lot of citizens and tourists on the coast for the long holiday weekend and we have the capacity to alert people
8515474 my small bit of advice to people living along the texas coast is just because the hurricane center track has it moving toward louisiana does not mean people should let their guard down
8515475 my mentor gunter petz once said half drunk is a waste of money if youre going to do something do it right with 100 percent commitment

8515481 das w re genau so absurd als wenn der van der bellen zu mir kommen und sagen w rde herr strache bitte gehen wir zusammen weil gemeinsam h tten wir ber 20 prozent
8515482 the underlying cause of all trouble is fear if only you could realize to some extent that omnipotent wisdom is your living loving father most of your fears would go if you could realize it completely every negative thing in your life would vanish away and you would demonstrate perfection in every phase now you see the object that jesus had in mind when he placed this clause first

8515484 es hat 1992 nicht funktioniert weil wir auf der richtigen seite der geschichte waren und es funktioniert 2008 nicht weil barack obama auf der richtigen seite der geschichte steht
8515485 unsere stellung in der welt ist geschw cht worden durch zu viel unilateralismus und zu wenig zusammenarbeit
8515486 den amerikanischen traum zu erneuern und die amerikanische f hrungsrolle in der welt wiederherzustellen
8515487 anytime you have a woman that is murdered the statistics would say frequently the woman does know the person who has assaulted them and oftentimes that is the spouse of the person
8515488 the most dangerous time for a woman thats in a domestic violence situation a woman or man thats in a domestic violence situation is when they make that determination that theyre going to leave
8515489 in a domestic case investigators are going to be looking at financial problems
8515490 theyre going to be looking at infidelity or strife in the marriage but that in and of itself doesnt prove the crime
8515491 there may be a very plausible reason for an individuals dna to appear or a fingerprint to appear in the house on the car even on the body
8515492 can i prove this beyond a reasonable doubt in front of a jury
8515493 theres no do overs there is no well take a second chance on that
8515494 good investigators all around the world come in every day whether its a year two years 10 years down the road and they say im still going to solve this case

8515496 kwa bahati mbaya hivi ni vifo visivyokuwa vya lazima kabisa kwa sababu vinatokea kwa sababu ya ukosefu wa raslimali tunazo habari zote kuhusu malaria na jinsi ya kupambana na ugonjwa huo na jinsi ya kuutokomeza tatizo letu ni raslimali
8515497 zanzibar imefanikiwa sana katika kutokomeza ugonjwa wa malaria ni eneo dogo na idadi ndogo zaidi ya watu
8515498 nimetembelea zanzibar majuzi tu na nikaonyeshwa vitanda vilivyokuwa vinalaliwa na wagonjwa wawili kwa wakati mmoja sasa viko wazi bila wagonjwa kwa sababu ugonjwa wa malaria katika visiwa hivyo umepunguzwa kufikia asilimia moja tu ya wagonjwa wote visiwani humo
8515499 ive never given to uw since they dropped planned parenthood 15 years ago caving to the mclean co right and started contributing to the problem
8515500 all i have to say to mr chapman is good luck i have some friends in the fundraising business and this has been a horrible year for them in a year when peoples equity has been diminished and gas gt
8515501 i think well view the super cup as a one off and we want to win it obviously
8515502 but it is also an opportunity to play anderson back from the olympic games nani whos available from suspension and if possible gary neville i think those three will all figure in fridays game
8515503 patrice evra and wayne rooney will also be involved after that it depends whos back from injury if owen hargreaves has maintained his training performances he will play i think well play a strong team but therell certainly be some changes
8515504 the knowledge worker and the ad hoc use of paper
8515505 ladies and gentlemen the great state of wyoming the gerund state home of the worlds largest mustard seed the state that totally does not owe nebraska 50 is proud to cast our seven eighths of a vote to whats his face uh the black one
8515506 i got a text message from former as teammate eric byrnes that said dude my wife just saw you on a billboard in vegas youve got to be kidding me
8515507 i cant be the seiko guy none of that zito said
8515508 that just looks bad like im not focusing on baseball but kathy said no its not an endorsement its not because of who you are or that you play baseball this is a modeling gig
8515509 i had my guitar in the shot so he thought i was a musician someone told him i was a baseball player he said whatever he is it doesnt matter we need this guy for the campaign so i did an eight hour shoot in malibu on an off day in june
8515510 whats great is that they dont want my name zito said
8515511 im just strictly a model who knows maybe itll open up other doors its always fun to be involved in different things
8515512 tudo est muito calmo agora as m es podem sair com seus filhos depois do anoitecer acreditamos que esta uma de nossas grandes conquistas
8515513 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterising the past decade continues
8515514 she praised sen joe biden and sen john mccain but she never said sen obama was qualified to be the commander in chief
8515515 ive talked to a lot of hillary supporters and they all feel the same way
8515516 hillary is supporting barack because he will champion the issues shes worked for her entire career and her supporters are supporting barack for the same reason
8515517 she gave an enthusiastic endorsement but yet had to satisfy her 1 900 delegates many of whom want a roll call vote
8515518 so far the convention seems unfocused and without a consistent message or theme after two days there has been no bounce in the polls it seems more about the personalities
8515519 she did ask her supporters to do what is right for the party and the country
8515520 but did it sway my vote not really im still leaning to mccain but i may not even vote i really am unsure what im going to do
8515521 ill probably vote for obama but a lot of people are saying they will write in hillary her speech brought a tear to my eye she should be the candidate she has more experience
8515522 a lot of delegates had to be sitting there wondering if they were nominating the right candidate to win this election
8515523 here in northeastern pennsylvania our feelings havent changed we wont be told who to vote for
8515524 the reality is there are many democrats who are concerned about a president obama and who are open minded and in some cases quite enthusiastic about a president john mccain
8515525 i know as john mccain knows the people of pennsylvania are hurting right now they are concerned about their jobs they are concerned about the ability to stay in their homes they are concerned about the rising prices of food and fuel and they are concerned about our continued ability to compete in this 21st century economy and thats why i think john mccain will do very well in pennsylvania
8515526 because of salbas ability to absorb several times its weight in water it may also help to curb hunger
8515527 he works at the same university where in 1921 dr frederic banting discovered insulin and won the nobel prize for medicine
8515528 there arent enough churches involved we got so many needs here in jacksonville and until the faith community gets involved and rolls up their sleeves and gets in the trenches were not going to solve our problems
8515529 but theres only so much that can go around from single churches we need to get every one of the churches together in a network to make a difference in jacksonville
8515530 either lay charges or to shut up and go away
8515531 the first one was definitely unexpected and a bit of shock
8515532 in 03 i think it all came a bit too soon when we came out of the end of the year and we had won a championship i dont think we knew what wed actually achieved and now knowing what goes into it and the rewards that go to the guys and everybody who helps thats the biggest part of it
8515533 if we do win a championship it would mean a ton more than 03 i think
8515534 the drought seasons in 04 and 05 definitely make you respect things a lot more feel gifted in that you have the opportunity
8515535 so anytime you even win a race you thrive on it a little more
8515536 i think you definitely get recognized a lot more especially in indy which is where i live
8515537 theres such a history there and people love that race and i probably get a little more respect too
8515538 i think if helio wins the next two races we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that
8515539 we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
8515540 i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
8515541 we just need to keep doing what weve been doing all year and well be fine
8515542 in terms of this season i think everything that hes done and weve had success together in the past is the result of all of those years of working hard day by day
8515543 its not something that just fell into place its his experience level all the things that hes managed to gather up in his data bank of experience is paying large dividends
8515544 with his ability to adapt his driving style to the racetracks that we have today in this series hes at the right place at the right time with the right team i think we were on the edge of it last year and i think his experience the whole last year was just at the point where it was starting to work well but this year scotts really been able to capitalize on that
8515545 its the same people and theyre obviously doing the same things that they were and maybe its a combination of all the small things have probably come through a little better
8515546 last year we were decent i think we just werent aggressive enough in the first part of the season and thats where we lost a lot of it and had to try and pull it back with six races to go
8515547 i think this season we started strong any season you win a indy 500 definitely gives you a lot of confidence and a lot of motivation for the rest of the year but i also think everybodys just been nailing it the engineering has been extremely good the pit stops have been fantastic where we have struggled a little bit weve mostly been able to come out with pretty good finishes
8515548 and its why im going to have to take a break from superhero stories for a little bit after final crisis
8515549 le choix de cette lection est clair les temps pr sents exigent davantage quun bon soldat ils exigent un dirigeant avis un dirigeant qui puisse apporter le changement le changement dont tout le monde a besoin

8515561 he has within him i think the qualifications to do it
8515562 truly helps mccain in his weakest area and that is the economy
8515563 the biggest problem obama has today is whether or not he can pull in the hillary clinton vote
8515564 perkara itu ulama muktabar dan kitab terdahulu harus dijadikan panduan bagi kita dan apa yang berlaku sekarang harus dijadikan pengajaran supaya kedua dua pihak dapat dibawa ke muka pengadilan
8515565 apabila satu pihak berasakan dirinya tidak terbela atau teraniaya maka mubahalah ini boleh dilakukan dengan membabitkan kedua dua pihak
8515566 apa yang kita bincangkan ialah latar belakang hukum sumpah dalam islam kita juga membincangkan sejarah pelaksanaan kes terdahulu dan kita bincangkan juga kes yang menyebabkan proses angkat sumpah ini harus dilakukan
8515567 apa yang dirumuskan ialah proses perundangan harus berjalan melalui perundangan sedia ada iaitu perundangan islam dan kita berasakan apa yang berlaku ini benar benar mengelirukan masyarakat dan ini satu insiden yang mengajar kita supaya masyarakat tidak lagi dikelirukan

8515585 una de las cosas que estamos haciendo en final crisis es obviamente como parte de la historia en la que el multiverso dc entero est bajo amenaza y estamos empezando a ver un poco m s de lo que eso significa ahora que la venida de darkseid ha causado que la estructura entera colapse entonces estamos comenzando a ver personajes que pueden ser de otros lugares y que pueden estar viniendo de mundos diferentes del multiverso o de diferentes l neas temporales y aquaman podr a muy bien ser algo de eso pero no voy a develar todo a n lo traeremos de vuelta para intentar poner a aquaman en un lugar en el que todos lo podamos entender
8515586 hubo un par de discrepancias que afectaron a los primeros ejemplares de y que resultaron de la forma en que las dos series estaban siendo escritos fuera de orden y con diferentes fechas de entrega finalmente todo me deja como el ltimo tipo en la cadena para resolverlo todo lo cual es lo que voy a hacer de hecho voy a hacer que todas esas discrepancias funcionen y se enlacen y tengo un plan para resolverlo para mi era como que oh chicos no se preocupen por ello algunas veces el error humano se mete en el sistema pero tambi n me doy cuenta que muchos lectores tienen una inversi n emocional genuina en la coherencia estricta de estos remiendos de universos ficticios as que s lo parec a justo que usara la crisis para limpiar cualquier problema persistente siempre se ha hecho ese tipo de cosas en las crisis no y no quer a hacer esto ning n tipo de reinicio de continuidad lo cual no es pero me di cuenta bueno por que no poner el tiempo y el espacio bien puedo f cilmente dar una raz n por la cual las cosas sucedieron distinto en diferentes c mics
8515587 bueno no voy a dec rtelo a n risas no conoceremos la respuesta a eso justo hasta el ltimo ejemplar de y los dos ejemplares despu s de que son tan grandes que no quer amos ver su influencia desestabilizando historias importantes que est n pasando en otros c mics
8515588 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 men and 15 women
8515589 this matter is of grave concern to the united nations we have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
8515590 there was a subversion of the constitution on november 3 and that is what people are protesting against
8515591 we are committed to the supremacy of the constitution and this will continue until the actions of november 3 are reversed
8515592 a search of the address in derbyshire is under way and is expected to take several days
8515593 the shc deposed judges oath taking has shocked the legal fraternity as it was in violation of the constitution and against the commitment they made and stand they took on november 3 2007
8515594 i consider the judges reappointment is a violation of the constitution betrayal to the people and acceptance of the position of november 3 2007 taken by pervez musharraf and adopted by ppp co chairman asif ali zardari
8515595 the underhand practice of the government seems to be creating a rift and division amongst the deposed judges and causing damage to the lawyers movement for restoration of judges and constitution
8515596 they have disappointed us by accepting the fresh appointment as judges of the sindh high court admitting that the unconstitutional steps taken on november 3 2007 were legal
8515597 the comprehensive update brings the game up to version v1 03 14 the
8515598 no record will ever go gold again cause theres this thing called limewire
8515599 the acquisition of postpath complements our strategy to develop an integrated collaboration platform designed for how we work today and into the future providing real productivity gains and a more satisfying user experience
8515600 we have been unhappy with microsoft for some time before the release of exchange 2007 which included voip voice over internet protocol in its unified messaging suite it was time to offer our customers an alternative
8515601 if you think about what were going to do we usually acquire when we move into new markets that we do not have the expertise for the product segments in
8515602 once again cisco makes a sound investment in an email technology vendor just like it did with
8515603 these are the clever guys who reverse engineered the exchange client protocol mapi rpc and the related on the wire details needed to make a vanilla install of outlook talk to a non exchange mail server with full fidelity impressive stuff of all the other exchange alternatives postpath has the most interesting architecture and i say that as one who has years emotionally invested in the openmail technology
8515604 i think cisco fell out of love with microsoft a while back something to do with voip support in exchange and how cisco thought it was microsofts partner but it turned out that microsoft was competing with them nothing familiar there at all
8515605 sounds like cisco wants to offer saas collaboration based on postpath and webex whoever said the email world has become dull and uninteresting
8515606 re establish with the members of the various communities the peaceful cohabitation and the harmony that has always been the distinctive mark of the indian society
8515607 the state is a mute spectator to the violence that has been unleashed in the christian community
8515608 very seriously and now they are going to pay them back
8515609 this is nothing but pure political hate propaganda against the christians when the root problem is of course caste oppression
8515610 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8515611 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india
8515612 i would say the violence is seven times worse than in december
8515613 i mean the government is trying its best but its like a mad frenzy they are just destroying everything
8515614 seriously you neo con nuts throw around the labels your daddies taught you were bad but you clearly have no idea what those words mean
8515615 seriously you neo con nuts throw around the labels your daddies taught you were bad but you clearly have no idea what those words mean

8515640 there were people who supported the war and people who opposed the war inside that convention hall
8515641 but what people are unified about is that when we make a decision to go to war that it should not be ideologically driven that it should be driven by a set of facts and common sense with regards to how we mobilize our country and our national interest
8515642 and i think that there is a strong feeling that even among those that supported george bushs decision initially to go in that there was some fudging of the numbers and shading of the truth and that as a consequence of our inability to create a strong alliance around our actions that we are now stuck in a quagmire that is going to cost us not only billions of dollars but thousands of lives and will require a much longer term commitment than the american voters had intended when they rallied behind the president
8515643 he was very successful at convincing people that he was a successful entrepreneur
8515644 the fact that two banks would give him 5 million each in personal loans is an indication that he was very persuasive
8515645 i was just wondering what was going on when i asked i heard that somebody went to the record store and just shot that man all i know he was a very nice person im still wondering why they did that
8515646 he was a great guy and its a shame because they shot three people here last year
8515647 not sure if this is or is not the norm but i just received my brand new iphone here in the uk and once it had been activated on itunes i found that the home screen the screen you can personalize with a photo already had a photo set against it
8515648 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this
8515649 i think its a kind of personal touch its nice maybe every phone that gets a full quality test should have its testers picture taken and left on there and the working conditions look pretty good

8515744 turns out bigfoot was just a rubber suit two researchers on a quest to prove the existence of bigfoot say that the carcass encased in a block of ice handed over to them for an undisclosed sum by two men who claimed to have found it was slowly thawed out and discovered to be a rubber gorilla outfit

8515753 it was a tough tough decision but it was the right one
8515754 i cant even describe the horrid feeling of thinking everyday that my child was out on the field with a convicted felon and the city had no idea nor did they take any steps to check that
8515755 finally this father stepped up and said ill coach the team
8515756 the players view can be really simple if i get paid for two extra games ill play two more games
8515757 the fans view is more of the real stuff is better the realistic view is its a way to generate more revenues
8515758 i know some people will want to pit ownership against players on this issue
8515759 to me this is about partnership for us to be able to extend this labor deal were going to have to find a way to grow revenues basically it would be the same preparation for most of the players what we would be doing is taking entertainment contests and improving them i think its something the fans probably want
8515760 if you dont like the quality of quarterback play now
8515761 take away those two preseason games that are in kind of a laboratory environment and see how you like it then
8515762 but do you have enough time to evaluate your younger players probably not that would be the issue youd have to come up with some other mechanism like scrimmages
8515763 they didnt get hurt in games they got hurt in practice you have to practice you cant get rid of injuries
8515764 i have a sword but i have chosen not to use it
8515765 but what really incensed me was when i was told i could not change it back to lloyds is pants because they said it was not appropriate
8515766 i asked if it was pants they didnt like and would lloyds is rubbish do but they didnt think so
8515767 so i tried barclays is better and that didnt go down too well either
8515768 the rules seemed to change and they told me it had to be one word so i tried censorship but they didnt like that and then said it had to be no more than six letters long

8515835 i dont think there can ever be a season like last year
8515836 driving recklessly and at a high rate of speed while fleeing the hampton police
8515837 these scores are indicative of how well prepared our students are for these types of standardized tests
8515838 the more rigorous courses students have taken in high school the higher sat scores are likely to be for example florida students who have taken calculus have an average sat math score of 601 compared to 447 for those students whose highest math course was algebra ii
8515839 in science test takers who have taken or will have taken physics have an average sat total score of 1 064
8515840 by contrasts those who have taken chemistry but have not taken physics average 975 more than half of the test takers report they will have taken four years or more of science by the time they graduate
8515841 we push students to take the most challenging courses they can
8515842 it is really hard to get your head around the fact that when your child goes on an excursion they need to have a permission slip signed by the parent but the school is within its rights to take a child to the doctor to be put on the pill
8515843 i would much prefer girls to seek advice on contraception than be pregnant
8515844 the issue it raises is why this girl feel comfortable talking to her mum and dad about going on the pill
8515845 the message is to open the lines of communication and for other parents to use this as a teachable moment
8515846 the schools first action in these situations is always to encourage the student to talk it through with parents
8515847 where this is not possible or the student refuses to do so and the student is deemed at serious risk the wellbeing coordinators are obliged to assist the student in seeking medical advice
8515848 it is the general practitioner who decides what is best for the student and the course of action not the school
8515849 the problems that underlie these student health issues are very complex this means that application of the privacy regulations can at times be seen as at odds with parents
8515850 we need to look at why kids feel they cannot talk about this with their parents
8515851 if she had and the parents refused to give her the pill its not necessarily going to stop her having sex
8515852 i worry more about the kids at this age who are having sex and not seeking contraception
8515853 the board has no evidence at this stage of its investigation that dr kossmanns practice of medicine within the terms of the undertaking poses a risk to the health and safety of the public the statement said
8515854 i am delighted the medical practitioners board of victoria has allowed me to continue practising as an orthopaedic surgeon dr kossmann said in a statement
8515855 i have given the undertaking to perform spinal or pelvic surgery under supervision pending the outcome of the boards investigation
8515856 i would like to reiterate i totally reject the flawed findings of the alfred hospital peer review and i see the boards decision as a positive step in fully restoring my professional reputation
8515857 traditionally its one of the heavier travel holidays of the year because it coincides with school and the end of summer
8515858 weve actually seen a decline locally in the normal traffic flow patterns a little lighter than it would normally be this time of year
8515859 we expect to be sold out because of the football game not labor day travel
8515860 people just didnt want to bother with the one night stay for paying all that money for gas to get over here
8515861 a rental car continues to be kind of a treat you give yourself
8515862 labor day is one of those holidays thats like the last burst of summer and people like to take those often short car trips
8515863 it does look like maybe a lot of florida is not considered abnormally dry anymore
8515864 you need more persistent rain not all at one time short term things like too much rainfall at one time does cause flooding a slower steadier rain over a longer period of time will alleviate drought
8515865 right now the ground is saturated and everyone has had it with rain

8515870 im so thankful that my midwife and doctor paid such wonderful attention to me and the little ladies
8515871 and im really glad that i got to 36 weeks with multiples
8515872 most of the time were only household names when we make a mistake so to not be known by many people is sort of like a sign of respect for me
8515873 we may have more fast guys to run down underneath that punt with some of these freshmen and redshirt sophomores that are ready to get on the field a little bit more
8515874 i look forward to both punters and i look forward to seeing a fast physical coverage team
8515875 if as a punter i can hang it up there is no way theyll be able to return it
8515876 ive worked a lot this summer and hopefully ill get the chance to make some plays for us again this season
8515877 the problem for me being back there has been catching the ball
8515878 ive been working and i feel more comfortable back there and i look forward to possibly being there in game action
8515879 i knew that i had the leg strength to hit it
8515880 it meant a lot to know that he could throw it but that he let me kick it and then did not rip me up or give me grief when it didnt go through it felt good to know that he expected me to make that kick
8515881 joe robinson has jumped into special teams and his touch and his feel is making a difference to our kickers and punters
8515882 i think were off to a good start on teams
8515883 kickers rely so much on technique and so much on feel
8515884 any small problem can affect our results so it feels good to know that we have someone who is so good at his job to help us

8515892 the general nature of the boards travel policies have allowed for excessive or imprudent expenses to go unquestioned
8515893 this is a very eye opening report for me to see and shocking in some respects
8515894 almost everything in the report and all the recommendations are reasonable common sense things that should be in our policy
8515895 we always welcome an extra set of eyes to look at what we do and how we do it

8515954 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas we are seeing parts of the outlying regions being affected rather than just urban areas
8515955 in the outlying areas health services are maybe less available in a city the services are better such as local access to gps theres also a certain amount of social stigma attached to being obese it may be that these obese people are not going to see their gp however we need to bear in mind that some pcts are better at recording the data than others which could affect the results
8515956 well why does paul always insist that we are justified by faith and not by works
8515957 in those passages paul is not really contrasting faith and works but faith and works of the law
8515958 works of the law are those specifically jewish ceremonial laws like circumcision and dietary restrictions those are the kinds of works that do not justify

8516052 her last act of activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life
8516053 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8516054 i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8516055 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8516056 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8516057 we would never have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis

8516076 helen clark has to stand him down just imagine the briefing note that visiting dignitaries get when they meet the minister of foreign affairs here is a guy whose misled the people of new zealand the prime minister and by the way his party is being investigated by the serious fraud office
8516077 would take some years for new zealand to get over
8516078 the serious fraud office is independent from government and treats a minister of the crown just like a private citizen and not above the law
8516079 i want to emphasise that it is entirely possible that there are innocent and honest explanations the use of statutory power to require documents to be provided will enable the sfo to ascertain how funds were applied
8516080 on information currently to hand there are serious questions whether donations intended for one purpose may have been put to a different purpose
8516081 the allegations concern important matters relating to the funding of a political party which go to the heart of the democratic process and involve a minister in the government
8516082 theyre not ruling it out and there may well be further evidence uncovered
8516083 we hit a wall when its a closed source solution

8516085 the risks posed to people taking prescribed medication for mental illness are unknown as are the long term effects of taser use

8516087 the tree had come down right across the roof so he couldnt get to the door
8516088 i tried to get him out but we could not get to him until the emergency services got here they had to talk him into letting them slide him out of there
8516089 i heard the corners start to move and then the sky just went black
8516090 when we heard the radio give the warning for banks county i knew we were going to get it i said weve got to go i grabbed my wife judy and we got to the bathroom and waited in the tub
8516091 you know how you see them on the news in the midwest
8516092 thats how this one looked it looked like something that is supposed to happen somewhere else not here
8516093 it started getting a lot of jukebox plays and that got us a lot of label attention
8516094 and then one day i got a call out of the blue from somebody wanting to send me a check for the jukebox royalties on a million plays i had no idea
8516095 i dont think it defines us as a band but im willing to ride it out if it will encourage someone to listen to some of our other stuff
8516096 a lot of times i get tired of singing a 10 year old song but when you do what we do your job is to create and when you get on the road your job is to give the people what they want it puts people in seats and im grateful for the success of the song
8516097 you can go to college in athens and have all that too
8516098 im not the only one who knows about those subjects ive seen a lot of things and participated in a lot of activities that werent good for me ive done some things im not proud of but what i am proud of is being lucky enough to run into a band that helped me when i was down and out if it wasnt for them id still be writing those same songs were very lucky to be doing what were doing i know there are thousands of people who would kill to be in our shoes and have this opportunity its awesome
8516099 we always have a great show at the georgia theatre because they treat us really well
8516100 and hano knows everybody in town if youre with hano his friends are your friends
8516101 we dont know what it feels to be no 1 we dont know what it takes to be no 1 so what were going to do is go out there and work as hard as we can and play the best that we can
8516102 its a motivating factor for our guys an excitement factor for our guys that feel like people believe that about our program
8516103 they know its about to be up for judgment again every week from this point forward
8516104 of course we want to go out and show were worthy of being the no 1 team
8516105 we definitely dont want to go out there and stink it up were looking forward to going out there and giving it our all
8516106 of course we want to make a statement because some people might be doubting us because we have a lot of injuries
8516107 we just want to go out there have fun make plays and just be no 1
8516108 i think the biggest thing is that we get to start the season its the first game of the year its easy to get up for us were excited to get this thing rolling
8516109 the proposed nbaf conceptual design is not expected to resist the effects of wind blown missiles

8516114 they say when the game comes im not going to be able to walk after it
8516115 i laughed it off and said im going to bring my a game
8516116 i think the move has been for the best overall
8516117 i just felt like it was time for a change time for a new start
8516118 its just a lot of learning a lot to pick up on
8516119 i feel like im coming on all right learning slowly but surely this isnt an offense that you can pick up overnight

8516137 i was on the set around one in the morning firing an automatic weapon when the gun wrangler said youve got to stop shooting theres a military coup about to happen
8516138 i didnt even know what that meant when was the last time we had a military coup in the us
8516139 i kept thinking my son and my wife were at the hotel so i walked off the set woke them up and i took them to the airport
8516140 i left my family at the airport got back to bangkok on another plane flew back to the set not knowing if i was going back into gunfire or tanks shooting and finished the movie
8516141 i heard about it on one of the local news stations on my commute in that they were offering the chance to drive these

8516143 occasionally it happens that you have a district that will be at odds with the national trend
8516144 it may be an anomaly but your local industry still depends on the energy sector and sectors tied with it and they have done reasonably well
8516145 its a bad sign that chapter 13s are down thats the bankruptcy where you have a plan to pay some money back over three or five years and chapter 7s are up thats where there is no such plan
8516146 weve seen distress in a lot of different industries and in particular in retail and home building
8516147 oil prices are so high and we have so much oil money that it insulates us
8516148 people are charging their gas and relying on their credit cards to live credit card problems simmer longer
8516149 there is a huge segment of our economy here that lives paycheck to paycheck we dont have the rush of the mortgage problems but we may see problems nonetheless
8516150 its that our economy is a little bit better and a person with debt has more flexibility in texas to work things out
8516151 i was young na ve enough to think i would see that in 5 10 years
8516152 then you see leaders killed you see police brutality residential segregation in cities about 10 years ago i thought i wont see this this is something for my grandchildren
8516153 we have a lot of work a lot but we are so much closer than i expected
8516154 we have one foot in both eras were still living out a lot of anger
8516155 the development program for this new product was based on options long standing relationship with the vodafone group a stylish design is important for mass market appeal while the unprecedented growth of voice and data traffic in the 2100mhz band is making hspa support in the 900 mhz band a commercial imperative our new device is the first commercially available hspa expresscard in the world to incorporate support for that 900mhz band
8516156 shut the f up current mood bullied i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins he being the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice in order to feed his addiction i was angry when i first read his attack on me but for me i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him i am not standing in his way i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is his need to throw a tantrum for the whole world to hear is i am not going to go into a play by play defense i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him p s im not the one that is so lost that i need to use my relationship with lindsay to earn a living i am always will and always have been here for her for her not for anything else so i think its safe to say that there is not now and never will be a tell all written by me when does your book come out mr lohan

8516164 i had one ceo telling me he didnt think recovery from katrina would be a problem
8516165 i dont think many people understood what natural gas processing was until after rita
8516166 our plants are better off than before katrina and rita but these are plants that have been there in some cases for 40 plus years
8516167 i think this is a pretty good indication that most of the companies continue to believe that prices are going to be either stable or increasing
8516168 we are very much interested in participating in the consolidation thats happening in the retail gas station sector
8516169 its a question of whether a company with a different focus can make money doing the same thing that someone else has already tried
8516170 my sense is thats going to be a tough road

8516180 la primera vez en la historia que a un gobierno se le hace responsable de un atentado y no a los terroristas
8516181 el psoe tarde o temprano pagar un precio por su actitud y no le saldr gratis esa tremenda deslealtad

8516184 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8516185 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8516186 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8516187 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8516188 the uk is the first place we were warned about under dress shots weve been scared ever since
8516189 it bothers me because i didnt get into the industry for that but you just have to plan stuff out
8516190 sometimes you just have to realize that its a part of what you do and embrace it and make sure youre poised to represent yourself the best way you can
8516191 we used to read stuff and then wed get scared and ask each other did we break up yesterday its hard enough to have a relationship in this industry without having the press involved too
8516192 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8516193 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8516194 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8516195 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8516196 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8516197 i love that word when people say describe yourself in three words id say ambition charisma and a little crazy
8516198 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8516199 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8516200 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8516201 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8516202 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8516203 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8516204 one of the things ive noticed as a developer engineer for the last 20 years is that i use the techniques of science all the time only im not studying
8516205 computer science is grounded in a deep sense of empiricism where the scientific method plays an essential role in the process of doing computer science
8516206 science is more than just hypothesis testing it requires a hypothesis without a clear answer if the answer is clear then you are a mathematician making design specs or an engineer building to design specs
8516207 the part thats about computers isnt a science and the part thats a science isnt about computers
8516208 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8516209 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8516210 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

8516212 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8516213 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8516214 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8516215 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

8516217 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8516218 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

8516225 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8516226 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8516227 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8516228 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8516229 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8516230 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8516231 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8516232 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8516233 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8516234 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8516235 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8516236 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8516237 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8516238 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8516239 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

8516251 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8516252 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8516253 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8516254 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8516255 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8516256 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8516257 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8516258 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8516259 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

8516275 president lyndon b johnson and some key officials seeing the increasingly soviet leaning egyptian president gamel abdel nasser as a threat made secret arrangements to help israel in its coming june offensive with the intention of toppling nasser
8516276 as part of operation cyanide uss liberty was sent to operate off the sinai coast where it was to be sunk with all hands by unmarked israeli aircraft and torpedo boats after which the united states would blame the attack on egypt and launch carrier airstrikes against cairo
8516277 the stubborn refusal of libertys crew to die or let their ship sink after 75 minutes of air and sea attack in spite of two american carrier sorties to aid her being inexplicably called back led to the cancellation of operation cyanide israels apology and offer of restitution for a tragic mistake the johnson administrations swift acceptance of that explanation and an equally quick reassuring hot line telephone call to soviet premieralexei kosygin
8516278 it now it appears that american political intelligence and military persons played a key role in setting up the liberty the plan was to sink the defenseless unarmed american ship sailing in international waters off the coast of egypt the soviets and their arab allies in particular egypt would then be blamed for the event
8516279 given the size and scope of this event we actually have an obligation to both lessen the environmental impact and heighten environmental awareness of all those that we reach
8516280 i definitely feel i have a chance in the next round too
8516281 biggest mistake of his life ill tell you when he goes at the t its right on the t but andy is a good guy
8516282 im not going to go for someone up 6 2 6 2 5 2 it was a bad miss but a miss i hit very hard it took a little bit of wind out i was excited about the way i was playing to kind of end it like that i guess was disappointing i can understand where he is coming from and i would probably be momentarily ticked off too i will try to find him in the next couple of days it wasnt my intention my intention was to hit it hard
8516283 so much of me coming back has been based on lets play through this summer and the u s open
8516284 i think we are a little scared to talk about what happens after here just because this has been such a focal point of my whole comeback
8516285 from our perspective there hasnt been any further discussion on this since that was announced as something of interest to gazprom
8516286 it doesnt mean its not possible but all our efforts on denali have been directly with bp and the state of alaska to do the work we have been doing and hopefully we can work toward an open season in the next several years
8516287 the thing is they got guys that are willing to make a three year commitment which i think is tremendous
8516288 we had guys that committed for 2004 and then all of a sudden 9 11 happened and then there were injuries
8516289 theres not much left to do training wise just get him to the race safe and sound and happy
8516290 they have to be prepared with whats going to happen we have to get him used to whats going to happen
8516291 i used to love when cincinnati reds fan courier won four grand slam championships major league baseball starts replay thursday and hes sure the chance to review grand slams and other home runs will be a hit
8516292 its made a fluid entry and quickly become part of the tennis landscape there has not been one iota of drawback not from players tournament officials or fans
8516293 i think baseball will like it anything to help get the calls right
8516294 ive heard people say that tennis set the standard for the introduction of replay not just the quality but how it was done we didnt rush it we put it through its paces
8516295 we made sure the players had confidence in it we knew that if we didnt do that and then it failed it would be years before we could try it again
8516296 you can make all the right calls you want but if the players dont have confidence in it its a recipe for disaster
8516297 i think it will work great in baseball it will add to the enjoyment of the spectators
8516298 football does it basketball too why not in baseball the tradition
8516299 i didnt have the energy to get up thats the reason i was just lying there without moving i wouldve loved to have taken a nap on the court because i was really exhausted
8516300 shes always complaining about something but shes always moving so good anyway
8516301 its not easy to get through this kind of thing
8516302 i was so tired and it doesnt mean its bad sportsmanship
8516303 i want people to remember me as a tennis player as a great tennis player a champion
8516304 i dont want them to remember me as a clown
8516305 its gonna be good in two days it will be ok
8516306 after that i was thinking more of it than i was really actually feeling pain
8516307 playing in the finals of the u s open i started believing more after the finals that i really can win
8516308 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8516309 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8516310 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8516311 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8516312 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8516313 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

8516319 your excellency the emissary from the united states is here
8516320 welcome to georgia mrs mccain it is a pleasure to see you again
8516321 its a pleasure to see you mr president i wish the circumstances were happier
8516322 i presume the senator has a message for me no we can speak frankly here
8516323 john wants you to know that he is deeply dismayed by the recent developments between georgia and russia he strongly supports georgias territorial integrity and that will be his official policy when he is president of the united states
8516324 this message is rather disappointing i express myself diplomatically in fact its not a message at all it is merely a restatement of what the news media report every day why does the senator send his wife to me if she has nothing to say
8516325 im here on a humanitarian mission mr president its not a cover story im really here with humanitarian aid
8516326 i thank you for the humanitarian aid but you are also here to accrue political benefit to your spouse it is not purely a humanitarian mission we all know this and it is shall we say impolite to pretend otherwise we are not talking in front of the cameras here tell me plainly mrs mccain why do i not hear from the senator directly and why do i no longer hear from mr scheunemann they couldnt talk to me enough before the recent unpleasantness and now it has gotten discouragingly quiet the senator used to say he was my friend
8516327 he is your friend but its a very busy time for john mr president there are many demands on him and the convention is approaching he is over subscribed quite frankly and im sorry he cant devote more time to the difficulties in your country and randy you know is johns chief foreign policy advisor and can no longer be active as a lobbyist im sure though that his business partners are still eager to work as your representatives in d c
8516328 you americans have many interesting idioms in your language is this called left hanging out to dry or would a better choice be twisting slowly in the wind
8516329 you should not speak to me of fairness i took on faith your husbands assurances that the united states knew russia would not risk international condemnation for an invasion of georgian territory he and mr scheunemann declared that they had political intelligence on the highest level that american pressure would prevent russian retaliation if i ousted their so called peacekeepers from south ossetia it seems perhaps that they were wrong russia pretends to withdraw her troops while staying in place she has announced to the world her recognition of south ossetia as an independent nation carved from the center of georgia i was told this could not would not happen perhaps i was not told the truth it appears that i was not in fact i might say that i was lied to
8516330 oh no mr president the senator would never have done that
8516331 perhaps you speak the truth perhaps your husband spoke in ignorance perhaps mr scheunemann and the white house decided it would be advantageous to generate an international crisis so as to benefit their candidate do people in your country still think that your political party has any standing in the international community apparently your campaign people think so and perhaps they worked matters out on their own this gives your husband how you say deniability perhaps he knew nothing
8516332 i assure you mr president that john is entirely sincere in his declarations of support for your country and would never be a party to cynical political manipulation of an ally we are friends of georgia and next year when the senator becomes president we will prove that to you
8516333 i beg your pardon mrs mccain but if your predictions are as accurate as your husbands then next year your husband will still be a senator if youll excuse me i must attend to other appointments now thank you for your humanitarian aid and i hope you have a pleasant time visiting our country its smaller now but not easier to travel in

8516353 if obama were elected it would clearly show the rest of the world that america really is what america is supposed to be about
8516354 the election of an african american candidate who was raised by a single caucasian mother and whose father is black is a reflection of an america where immigrants can come and really achieve greatness and find evidence that the american dream is not a fantasy
8516355 the fact that you could bring people together you could get them excited you could get them to believe that they could make some changes in their own lives and their own community is really what we need in this country
8516356 and i feel fortunate really because my life has kind of bridged the period of time when it was virtually unreasonable to think such a thing is possible to the point in time where its a reality
8516357 the expectations that too many in our community have would be so unrealistic that it would be impossible for him to fulfill them
8516358 he has to be concerned about all people and not just black people
8516359 when i graduated from harvard university none of the architectural firms in the country would hire me
8516360 i think i had come to believe that change does come about even though its going to be very long
8516361 but i would suggest that obamas ascension was so rapid it was difficult to comprehend
8516362 i think he was looking for somewhat of a confirmation you know im a black man also ive survived all the slings and arrows over the years im not bitter im still fighting and struggling but yet if we stay the course achievement can come about so i think he came to get from me some confirmation of this but also to begin to rally the troops
8516363 obama gives you that hope that wow i want to vote for this guy i want to be part of the political process which has been lost over the past 20 plus years
8516364 he has the policies and he has the plan to back it up but sometimes its almost more important how you present it to people and to have that inspiration
8516365 obamas not god and he doesnt need to be mistaken or confused for god
8516366 but he is a person with a plan and a person that gives us hope and that hope will hopefully encourage us to change and make the world different
8516367 i think dr king would be honored to know that he had such a role in making this historic event happen
8516368 i cant help thinking that is the way the country is supposed to be going it may not be moving fast enough for a lot of people but the bottom line is we are headed in the right direction with this election
8516369 they gathered to protest in front of the white house in 1917 and were beaten by police officers
8516370 i want my students to see that i want them to see that it took a tremendously courageous succession of acts by judges in this country to begin to forge some protection for political minorities so theyd just have the chance to say their point of view
8516371 because of the history of our country and race relations i feel like the contest is going to play a deep role in the coming months im kind of mad im not going to be here in november to see what its going to be like in cleveland
8516372 there is no way that an african american is going to rise to those heights

8516432 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8516433 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8516434 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8516435 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8516436 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8516447 we conclude that even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making
8516448 this kind of learning had been suggested to be subconscious a century ago on the grounds that it was observed in some species like rats that were supposed to be deprived of conscious awareness

8516452 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8516453 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8516454 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

8516467 im very excited about the direction that cgs is headed
8516468 cgs has really become the place for experimenting with new ways of thinking about teaching and offering innovative educational programs
8516469 there is a lot of fascination with the technology but less clear evidence of educational benefits
8516470 its not the same as the live in classroom experience
8516471 but i think that new technologies can bring a lot to enhancing the way we teach
8516472 promote the development of knowledge the sharing of different world perspectives and the coming together to build a solution among people and partners in different parts of the world

8516474 isolated instances of terrorist outfits manipulating the stock markets to raise funds for their operations have been reported stock exchanges in mumbai and chennai have on occasions reported that fictitious or notional companies were engaging in stock market operations
8516475 among terrorist outfits the ltte has a very well established network of legitimate business which provides both funds as well as logistics for their activities jehadi terrorist organisations have begun to follow suit
8516476 the lashker e taiba the hizbul mujahideen and the al badr militant outfits which operate in india are well patronised including through provisions of funds by certain official agencies across the border

8516480 a compact fluorescent lamp cfl is a light bulb that uses less energy than a standard bulb to provide the same amount of light those bearing the governments energy star label use 1 3 the energy of a traditional bulb can last up to 10 times longer and save 30 or more in energy costs over their lifetime you can find energy star cfls most anywhere you currently shop for light bulbs what kind of difference can one cfl make consider this if every american swapped just one bulb for an energy star labeled cfl it would collectively save more than 8 billion in energy costs prevent burning 30 billion pounds of coal and remove 2 million cars worth of greenhouse gas emissions from our atmosphere just imagine the difference we could make if we replaced all of the lights we use most
8516481 we plan to screen parzania at public places across the state so that people can watch the film without fear

8516484 gibneys documentary captures thompsons bizarre orbit though american letters and politics with extensive use of archival footage but also through recreations animation and more
8516485 lets face it without energy the whole economy and economic society we have set up would come to a halt so you want to have control over such an important resource that you need for your society and your economy
8516486 to succeed you have to believe in something with such a passion that it becomes a reality
8516487 the way we produce and use energy must fundamentally change
8516488 i see little happening at the federal level much more needs to happen

8516491 as a senator mccain has shown his independence on several issues
8516492 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8516493 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8516494 i think he has done pretty well so far what do you think
8516495 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8516496 now despite being complicit in this catastrophic foreign policy john mccain says barack obama isnt ready to protect our national security
8516497 now let me ask you whose judgment should we trust should we trust john mccain
8516498 i really thought things were going to get tense but in the end it was all so emotional holding hands and cheering and dancing to love train
8516499 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8516500 but when i do i would like it to be a bolivian sea
8516501 the sea belongs to us by right to take it back is our duty
8516502 there is a clear historic injustice and the bolivian navy was created as a way of protesting before the whole world
8516503 supposedly there are talks but i see no advances no signs of change
8516504 everything is still as it always has been and i think will remain like this
8516505 surviving in waters infested with sharks are things we are not used to but we are ready for the open sea
8516506 si adds air force customers whereas sercos business is exposed to the army and navy
8516507 the acquisition will also add to sercos capabilities in the us and increase its access to higher growth markets
8516508 we are seeing good growth in defence including in the uk and australia
8516509 we tend to get more phone calls from governments and private sector customers saying that they need to do more for less money
8516510 in defence if you have shrinking budgets people will stop procuring new kit such as airplanes and weapons
8516511 they will use what they have got and hire people who know how to get the existing product to go further
8516512 this is a business where we want to expand we will be absolutely keen to keep all of them
8516513 india already has a middle class of 200 million people and it is growing

8516524 today when finally we get a chance to vote down this legislation mr iemma takes it off the table
8516525 if ever you need an example of a bloke whose not in control either of his government or his party its what happened now
8516526 michael costa has condemned his privatisation to a cowards death
8516527 the community will be furious that the iemma government has squandered their money on a parliamentary recall that achieved nothing
8516528 its on for young and old so bring it on
8516529 im not a seat warmer i dont sit around because im unemployable to pick up a salary at the public expense
8516530 establish that the accused was not entitled to the amounts that he claimed and received as the result of his dishonest conduct
8516531 it is incumbent on the prosecution to do this in order to establish to the necessary degree that the accused had an intent to defraud when he forged and uttered the documents in support of his claims
8516532 in the circumstances it is not necessary to make any finding as to whether or not the accused had an honest belief that he was entitled to claim as he did
8516533 for these reasons i conclude that while the accused acted dishonestly in making the claims that he did it has not been established that he did so with the necessary intent to defraud
8516534 accordingly in due course there will be a judgment of acquittal in respect of each of the charges
8516535 im very pleased its been a very significant toll on myself and my family
8516536 its cost me a million dollars in financial costs and an unbelievable toll in personal and psychological costs
8516537 no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed as soon as may be of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice
8516538 right of person against whom proceedings are instituted to be defended any person accused of an offence before a criminal court or against whom proceedings are instituted under this code may of right be defended by a pleader of his choice
8516539 these failures were a cause of the accident which resulted in the death of daniel burman
8516540 it hit the ground the impact had a catapult effect
8516541 burman fell out of his harness because he was not wearing it properly he fell approximately ten metres to the ground and died almost instantly
8516542 it would be to my knowledge the largest penalty ever imposed by a court in this jurisdiction and a significant penalty in the country for offences of this type
8516543 i expect that these breaches of the act are not at the top of the range nevertheless they are serious matters
8516544 the findings bring little cheer to ardent supporters of reform the indian public is on balance clearly opposed to disinvestment of public sector undertakings downsizing of the government and entry of foreign companies those who are well informed about these policies are even more opposed to these than the less informed there is little demand for reduction in direct taxes if the finance minister wanted to increase the tax on the rich he would have solid public backing from all quarters except of course the urban rich there is an overwhelming agreement that public services like electricity water road transport hospitals and schools should be run by the government and not by private companies if running these public services well requires increasing the fee or tariff the people including the poor are prepared to shell out more money the public believes that the economic policies of the last 15 years have benefited only the rich only about a quarter of the respondents more rich than the rest believe that the reforms have benefited the poor as well to put it simply if anyone cared to put policies of economic reforms on the political agenda and asked the public for its opinion there is every chance that these policies will be voted out
8516545 to arrive at this finding brain scans were made of 22 newborns
8516546 brain activity increased in the babies temporal and left frontal areas whenever the repetitious words were played
8516547 we just saw it this morning his ankle is not right
8516548 sure im disappointed hes a real nice horse but you have to put the safety of the horse first i just talked to rick monday night and he was so happy about how benny worked
8516549 i would rather have him out just like i would rather have curlin out of the woodward
8516550 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas we are seeing parts of the outlying regions being affected rather than just urban areas
8516551 in the outlying areas health services are maybe less available in a city the services are better such as local access to gps theres also a certain amount of social stigma attached to being obese it may be that these obese people are not going to see their gp however we need to bear in mind that some pcts are better at recording the data than others which could affect the results
8516552 we are pleased to announce this partnership with peoples liberation for the united states market peoples liberation will bring both additional resources and complementary expertise to our existing u s operation and will allow for more focus and faster growth of the j lindeberg brand
8516553 j lindeberg was always built with the us market in mind i am really confident that this joint venture will enable us to to capitalize of the brand awareness and position that we have built the last 12 years as well as create stronger synergies between the group of brands that are now managed under peoples liberation
8516554 we are excited about adding j lindeberg usa to our growing portfolio of brands

8516558 for extra credit what color thong was i wearing on tuesday of last week
8516559 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8516560 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8516561 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8516562 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8516563 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8516564 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8516565 the futures market provides a platform for price discovery and risk management it is nothing but a forecast of likely demand and supply and prices at a future point of time it does not impact prices
8516566 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8516567 if someone had told me 45 years ago of what were about to witness i would say youre crazy youre out of your mind
8516568 it is a major major step in making real the hopes and dreams and aspirations of so many americans who attended the march and who supported the march
8516569 the democratic party has come such a distance from 1963
8516570 under the leadership of people like jimmy carter bill clinton and all that lyndon johnson said sen obama is the personification of what the democratic party is about
8516571 a dirty and nasty word we cannot be patient we do not want to be free gradually
8516572 i just dont know whats going to be my reaction
8516573 the only advantage rice has over rick noriega is the state is not as expensive
8516574 we need to kill the snake while we have the hoe in the hand
8516575 we can turn it texas from a deeply red state to a state where we have real chances to pick up later congressional seats and statewide offices that democrats rarely win these days
8516576 but this is the year and this is the man rick noriega state sen rick noriega of texas
8516577 hes been so defined by his opponents and his detractors
8516578 i dont think hes aggressively stepped up to define who he is yet
8516579 i havent seen any movement toward him since the primaries
8516580 he needs to project that he understands in his heart and soul the needs of this country and the needs of all americans no matter their upbringing
8516581 hes not a populist its not where he is comfortably authentically one of the challenges is how he gets there authentically
8516582 he needs to reach out more to hillary and stop acting like he doesnt need her
8516583 its a little like a funeral but its closure and its one final step
8516584 its symbolic we only got to vote in a hotel room
8516585 im glad its unanimous however i wanted texas to get its chance to vote
8516586 its my very first time and i am very excited
8516587 this primary was so close it generated so much excitement we have two great candidates i just wanted to be here
8516588 it used to be an elite thing theyve taken street art and they make the galleries come to them
8516589 the work for the people of california and to solve this budget problem is the most important thing right now for me
8516590 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8516591 failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8516592 we are no longer a christian nation we are also a muslim nation
8516593 it took a speech that i had made extolling faith and made it seem as if i had said that america was a muslim nation
8516594 whatever we once were we are no longer a christian nation at least not just we are also a jewish nation a muslim nation and a buddhist nation and a hindu nation and a nation of nonbelievers
8516595 i truly fear an obama presidency this guys so dangerous who needs al qaida
8516596 he is a shenanigan it was my fault for trusting him so i will pay for it
8516597 i certainly didnt want to completely slander somebody especially a guy that might be the next president then i get audited every year or something
8516598 i might have said can you put a subliminal shadow in i dont know that i said put devil horns
8516599 throwing noodles against the wall as to what could be done
8516600 an ad that was never paid for got more media than they could ever hope for
8516601 maybe you cant hear should we clean your ears out
8516602 i dont care to do any more political type stuff
8516603 ok now the second question how would you feel if an indian revenue service irs officer handles the
8516604 the test to determine whether an act amounts to contempt of court or not is this does it make the functioning of the judges impossible or extremely difficult if it does not then it does not amount to contempt of court even if it is harsh criticism
8516605 the only situation where i would have to take some action was if my functioning as a judge was made impossible for example if someone jumps up on to the dais of the court and runs away with the court file or keeps shouting and screaming in court or threatens a party or a witness
8516606 in a democracy the people should have the right to criticise judges the purpose of the contempt power should not be to uphold the majesty and dignity of the court but only to enable it to function
8516607 hence in a democracy there is no need for judges to vindicate their authority or display majesty or pomp their authority will come from the public confidence and this in turn will be an outcome of their own conduct their integrity impartiality learning and simplicity
8516608 prudence would dictate that we leave the text as it is until our candidate catches up with us
8516609 i want to give him a platform he can run on
8516610 perth is not what i should be doing right now i really want to go to perth but i cant until i get better
8516611 the doctors said i have the early stages of pneumonia which a lot people probably have
8516612 the ambassador outlined the russian federations position on recent developments in georgia
8516613 mr smith stated that australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and believes that russia should abide by ceasefire arrangements and return to the positions they occupied before the conflict began
8516614 mr smith stated that it would only be through dialogue and a cooperative approach that tensions in the region and internationally would be reduced and a long term resolution of the issue achieved
8516615 beijing south african sporting authorities left natalie du toit badly in the lurch only hours before her historic olympic debut open water swimmer missing a leg
8516616 ryk neethling told how he had to break up a fight between the sa swimming captain gerhard zandberg and roland schoeman about comments that zandberg had made after neethling tried to make peace he feared that swimming sas head coach dirk lange would hit him
8516617 i think quite honestly when corporate ceos see that those firms are representing the very terrorists who hit their bottom line back in 2001 those ceos are going to make those law firms choose between representing terrorists or representing reputable firms and i think that is going to have major play in the next few weeks and we want to watch that play out
8516618 most americans understand that legal representation for the accused is one of the core principles of the american way
8516619 but its offensive shocking to use his word that mr stimson a lawyer would argue that law firms are doing anything other than upholding the highest ethical traditions of the bar by taking on the most unpopular of defendants its shocking that he would seemingly encourage the firms corporate clients to pressure them to drop this work and its shocking though perhaps not surprising that this is the person the administration has chosen to oversee detainee policy at guantanamo
8516620 no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed as soon as may be of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice
8516621 right of person against whom proceedings are instituted to be defended any person accused of an offence before a criminal court or against whom proceedings are instituted under this code may of right be defended by a pleader of his choice
8516622 and lest there be any doubt mr stimson we are not receiving any money for this my firms work is pro bono
8516623 if the bulk of the detainees are guilty of nothing but being in the wrong place at the wrong time if theres no evidence that some of them did the things of which the government has accused them then it would mean that we locked innocent people in a hole for five years
8516624 i dream of a day when while retaining our respective national identities one can have breakfast in amritsar lunch in lahore and dinner in kabul

8516629 if you leave an emergency department overcrowded staffing ratios arent kept and elderly patients unfortunately will fall and its a risk
8516630 i have some suspicions and i know of a couple of cases of people who have actually fallen off trolleys but id like to follow it up and double check to make sure what actually happened to them long term
8516631 pressure areas occur people dont get fed properly and get sleep deprived because being in an emergency department our lights are on 24 hours a day seven days a week and they dont get good sleep
8516632 one of the ways that may be delivered is by dropping elective surgery in certain areas for a short period of time
8516633 theres been pressure for the last few weeks and we have been watching this with great concern
8516634 now it has reached absolute crisis point to the extent that the emergency medicine specialists are asking to use surgical beds too to make sure that patients actually receive the care they need
8516635 health ministry has insisted that the same work force should continue till finalisation of the project
8516636 this government urges the union government that the constitution of india should be rewritten afresh having regard to the changing needs while preserving the unity integrity and sovereignty of the nation

8516654 we do not have any threat at the current level
8516655 moreover we have a plan to avoid any untoward situation
8516656 sukhna lake is an important destination for tourists from all over the world this water level should remain for the next few months and now we are working to prevent too much silt from entering the lake
8516657 were expecting that this water level will be maintained until april 2009
8516658 apart from dal lake in kashmir this is the only lake in northern india where you will see shikaras
8516659 there are five shikaras and these were introduced here around one and a half years back there is huge demand for them and they are booked throughout the day
8516660 to reduce the silt level we have made small water bodies in the catchment areas but we need very advanced technology and equipment to prevent this completely we have sent a proposal to the central government regarding this but it is very time consuming and we are not expecting much out of that
8516661 we have many efficient plans for the maintenance of the lake but all of them are on paper our administration is very enthusiastic about this but we have to wait for a green signal from the central government that usually takes many years
8516662 the first to be brought out was sarita the wife of billu ram she was injured after that his four children were rescued

8516668 china today exports in a single day more than it exported in all of 1978
8516669 china operates on so large a scale that it cant help changing the nature of the game
8516670 the us does not have the hand it had in 1945 or even in 2000
8516671 still it does have a stronger hand than anyone else the most complete portfolio of economic political military and cultural power and it will not be replaced in the foreseeable future
8516672 artillery fire and helicopter gunships engaged a militants hideout in raghan area of bajaur district at least 30 militants including important local taliban commanders and some foreign fighters were killed in the action

8516679 the nato ukraine commission condemned the decision by the russian federation to extend recognition to the south ossetia and abkhazia regions of georgia
8516680 readiness to contribute to the settlement of the conflict in georgia
8516681 russia is not yet reconciled to the new map of this region
8516682 unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8516683 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8516684 mr dewitt said this was happening because consumers were demanding something different but also because the technology was now in place to allow downloading of software on demand
8516685 the heller decision by the supreme court still said that the 2nd amendment guarantees an individual right
8516686 the first tombstone i saw as i got out of the car was samuel charlotte and joe simmerly inside my mind i could feel my ancestors gather around me i felt strangely happy for being in a graveyard it was hard to leave theyve been pulling at me to find out stuff about spyrock ever since that day like they want me to know their story what happened there and who their part of me is so its because of a bunch of ghosts that i found yall maybe your ghosts are there with them laughing about us talking to each other

8516688 tahini miso rice vineger what the hell these do not belong in a lasagna
8516689 in the most recent poll i am ahead by a commanding 1 percent
8516690 right now we are holding a majority by the skin of joe liebermans teeth
8516691 and president obama is going to need a working majority in the senate
8516692 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
8516693 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
8516694 the ghost is not a weapon its a way of life
8516695 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8516696 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8516697 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8516698 the american people are dumb enough to give the republicans another shot
8516699 encourage users to analyze comment on and even challenge washingtonpost coms articles
8516700 everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler
8516701 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8516702 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8516703 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8516704 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8516705 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8516706 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8516707 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8516708 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8516709 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8516710 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8516711 she should have kept her mouth shut or she should step down
8516712 vote for whoever you want to vote for but remember this never took place because if they hear were divisive you do nothing but demean the democratic party and put john mccain in office
8516713 everywhere im going im preaching for lack of a better word to people that this is the way it works in america
8516714 you have elections and somebody wins and when its in a primary you pull behind the primary victor
8516715 i have modified pdf files with the full acrobat in the past but have always felt a little uneasy the beauty of pdfpen is the simple graphic interface where you can see it all happening
8516716 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8516717 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8516718 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8516719 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8516720 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8516721 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8516722 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8516723 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8516724 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8516725 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8516726 and you know as our general policy weve always encouraged the governments of india and pakistan to negotiate their differences peacefully
8516727 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
8516728 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
8516729 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
8516730 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
8516731 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
8516732 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
8516733 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
8516734 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
8516735 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
8516736 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
8516737 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
8516738 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
8516739 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
8516740 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
8516741 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
8516742 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
8516743 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
8516744 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
8516745 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
8516746 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
8516747 that should not take away from their great qualities as pioneers and doers
8516748 then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots
8516749 pickens is reaching that part of deep america thats usually not touched by the traditional environmental discourse
8516750 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8516751 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8516752 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8516753 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8516754 use it up wear it out make it do or do without
8516755 wir k nnen uns nicht erlauben auf dauer mit diesen spieler weiterzuarbeiten
8516756 wir haben einen teuren kader und genug spieler das muss einfach reichen
8516757 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
8516758 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
8516759 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
8516760 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
8516761 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
8516762 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
8516763 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
8516764 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8516765 we were still working over the speech text in the car over to the fleet center in 2004
8516766 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8516767 i was so exhausted i was breathing hard and i didnt have the energy to get up
8516768 to end it like that it was kind of i guess disappointing
8516769 he served right at me for sure yeah thats a good strategy sometimes
8516770 it was a bad miss but it was a miss that i hit pretty hard
8516771 i was just trying to tell myself to enjoy it
8516772 because who would have thought that i would be back out there and get another opportunity to play on that court in front of the fans and you know still be around here at the u s open
8516773 die anforderungen durch compliance vorschriften werden immer h her damit steigt auch der bedarf an externen backup services
8516774 alle gro en hersteller wie ibm fsc hp sun oder emc versuchen mittlerweile ihre services beim kunden zu platzieren
8516775 in den vergangenen drei bis vier jahren konnten wir ein ordentliches wachstum von f nf bis sechs prozent pro jahr beobachten
8516776 ibm bietet seinen kunden beim backup serviceleistungen damit sich diese nicht damit aufhalten muss sich in hardware software und service einzuarbeiten
8516777 heute wird rund die h lfte der daten nicht mehr zentral erfasst
8516778 vom umfang der services gesehen ist hp nach ibm die organisation die am ausgepr gtesten dienstleistungen adaptiert hat
8516779 die anforderungen der fachabteilungen an die rechenzentren unserer kunden steigen so dass backup windows immer k rzer werden mehr sicherheit gefordert wird und trotzdem nicht mehr ressourcen bereitgestellt werden
8516780 mit seinen eigenen produkten und seinem partner emc hat fsc eine starke truppe um nun auch das thema backup abzudecken
8516781 mit ca fokussiert sich unser unternehmen stark auf den unteren mittelstand mit symantec auf gr ere firmen
8516782 backup ist oft das ungeliebte kind im rechenzentrum aber f r unternehmen doch massiv wichtig
8516783 die anforderungen der fachabteilungen an die rechenzentren unserer kunden steigen so dass backup windows immer k rzer werden mehr sicherheit gefordert wird und trotzdem nicht mehr ressourcen bereitgestellt werden
8516784 nach und nach wollen immer mehr hersteller ihr dienstleistungsgesch ft aufbauen
8516785 by 2008 a wealth of skills and experience will begin to disappear from the job market the first members of the baby boom generation will turn 62 the average retirement age in the large developed economies of north america europe and asia by 2050 40 percent of europes total population and 60 percent of its working age population will be people over 60 with mounting pension obligations and shrinking workforces germany italy spain and japan could face economic crises as management guru peter drucker has suggested the confluence of a bulging aged population and a shrinking supply of youth is unlike anything that has happened since the dying centuries of the roman empire
8516786 we are about to face a demographically driven shortfall in labor that will make the late 1990s seem like a minor irritation
8516787 mom im in mcdonalds amp theyre playing our song i love you
8516788 u want me to do what with your box play with it
8516789 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8516790 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8516791 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8516792 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8516793 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8516794 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8516795 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8516796 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8516797 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8516798 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8516799 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8516800 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8516801 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8516802 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8516803 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8516804 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8516805 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8516806 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8516807 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8516808 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8516809 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8516810 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8516811 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8516812 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8516813 as long as young people are subjected to the obama snare and delusion theyll continue to have a ring in their nose and will provide the democratic party with the tether
8516814 fascist and communist regimes that try to keep workers in their place
8516815 central issue of politics in america the domination of concentrated corporate power over our governments and over our economy
8516816 these companies have hijacked our government corrupted our elections and they have turned the republican and democratic parties into agents or representatives of big business
8516817 its quite clear that in this country we need a third political force made of up of people all over the country who have committed to the proposition that corporations and their governments must become our servants not our masters
8516818 for 40 years i have not flip flopped thats why we have safer cars clean air and clean water laws
8516819 we all have an equal right to run for election
8516820 we are nearing a stage now of burgeoning solar energy reality and potential the mere proposal to build this a giant coal burning plant would be considered a crime against humanity
8516821 it would be considered a poisoning of the air water and soil that are the background of human health and safety
8516822 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8516823 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8516824 really youre focused youre listening and getting a feel for the hall you havent been there you dont quite have that same feel as if youd been there for a few hours even
8516825 hey i got an idea summer movies make more so why dont we push back harry potter and the half blood prince till july 2009 so it can make more money
8516826 gee what a novel idea even though really harry potter movies will make bank no matter what month of the year they come out and really who cares about the millions of outraged fans
8516827 today when finally we get a chance to vote down this legislation mr iemma takes it off the table
8516828 if ever you need an example of a bloke whose not in control either of his government or his party its what happened now
8516829 michael costa has condemned his privatisation to a cowards death
8516830 the community will be furious that the iemma government has squandered their money on a parliamentary recall that achieved nothing
8516831 its on for young and old so bring it on
8516832 im not a seat warmer i dont sit around because im unemployable to pick up a salary at the public expense
8516833 im here because there are things to be done and if these things are not to be undertaken im not just talking about electricity but other reforms certainly there is no role for me in the nsw parliament
8516834 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
8516835 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
8516836 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
8516837 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8516838 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8516839 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8516840 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8516841 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8516842 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8516843 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8516844 we are able to see the scrolls in such detail that no one has before
8516845 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8516846 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8516847 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8516848 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8516849 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8516850 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8516851 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8516852 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterising the past decade continues
8516853 nabi muhammad pernah mengatakan bahwa sembilan dari 10 kekayaan berada di tangan pedagang sedangkan sisanya yang hanya satu bagian itu dibagi bagi di antara sekian banyak orang yang lebih memilih menjadi pekerja
8516854 kita mengenal nama nama seperti utsman bin affan dan abdurrahman bin auf mereka adalah konglomerat di zamannya istri rasulullah siti khadijah juga merupakan konglomerat
8516855 rasullah sejak masa mudanya telah menekankan pentingnya berbisnis beliau telah merintis usaha bisnis sejak masih usia belasan tahun beliau juga telah mencontohkan bagaimana cara berbisnis yang baik yakni bisnis yang dilandasi oleh kejujuran dan keterbukaan aman dan kecerdasan sehingga beliau digelari al amin artinya orang yang dapat dipercaya
8516856 selama ini umat islam hanya menjadi penonton sehingga ekonomi dikuasai oleh umat lain kalau umat islam ingin bangkit dari ketertinggalan di bidang ekonomi maka umat islam harus mengarahkan kembali perhatiannya pada bidang ekonomi seperti yang pernah dicontohkan oleh rasulullah dan para sahabat dahulu
8516857 asalkan kita menyadari potensi kita dan mau bersatu insya allah kita bisa menjadi pengusaha yang berhasil
8516858 semua jari itu bisa mengepal bila ditopang oleh telapak tangan artinya untuk sukses bisnis kita harus bersatu sumberdaya yang ada harus dikelola dengan baik artinya perlu manajemen yang baik
8516859 this gift is not only a gift from our hearts but our consciousness as well
8516860 we know that by doing this we are buying this village hope and a source of self reliance for many years to come this is one of the ways our church fulfills its commitment to outreach
8516861 overall we believe in our ability to be part of a solution and a world that works for everyone whether its buying llamas and chicks or just serving the local community the center for spiritual living of castle rock is a center of conscious living that intends to be part of the change for good happening in the world
8516862 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8516863 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8516864 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8516865 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8516866 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8516867 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8516868 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8516869 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8516870 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8516871 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8516872 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8516873 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8516874 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8516875 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8516876 israel missed a chance to learn from the most influential musicians of the decade and the beatles missed an opportunity to reach out to one of the most passionate audiences in the world
8516877 on our 60th anniversary we would like to take the opportunity to offer you a second chance to play in israel
8516878 after my father was unable to listen to the beatles
8516879 the general nature of the boards travel policies have allowed for excessive or imprudent expenses to go unquestioned
8516880 this is a very eye opening report for me to see and shocking in some respects
8516881 almost everything in the report and all the recommendations are reasonable common sense things that should be in our policy
8516882 we always welcome an extra set of eyes to look at what we do and how we do it
8516883 if we can improve from that thats a good thing
8516884 fundamental to our existence as an independent democratic free state
8516885 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment
8516886 the new nuclear investment the new renewables investment the new investment in clean coal and gas
8516887 wait you chose to call this little person person back for the truck unloading position with tons of heavy lifting involved
8516888 bun kalo pulang singgah dulu di cafe mau beli es krim
8516889 why me millennium we are angsty bitches all of us and there isnt a damn reason to be
8516890 working as a team to enhance eating habits and self esteem
8516891 whether girls see movies tv shows or magazine pictures they definitely recognize an emphasis on a certain body type but the reality is that less than 5 percent will attain that idealized image
8516892 its good for the college girls as well as the younger ones
8516893 theres a lot of focus in the media on being thin and perfect but i know guys myself that would rather not date a girl whos rail thin dykes actually prefer their femmes to have some meat on them nothing like going down and sucking on a big fat juicy pussy
8516894 we want the girls to feel better about themselves and not to be so concerned about what others think some of their friends might criticize the fact that they are kept naked 24 7 in my pleasure dungeon ready to service me and other dyke professors at our command but we try to beat the shame out of them
8516895 as feminism was coming to the forefront of american politics in the 1960s twiggys tiny fragile figure was at the height of its popularity
8516896 this frame may have been popular because it made women appear very non threatening even weak we tell our girls that being obese even bovine empowers them plus it makes for a nice cushion for the pushin when we bang their asses from behind with a strap on in place
8516897 we want to show girls that lesbianism can be fun and it can be used in a variety of ways
8516898 we help build their licking and sucking skills familiarize them with a female anus and vagina and show them how to suck face with a middle aged dyke etc we try to get some math and physics in there too eventually so far we havent had time but math is rarely used in everyday life anyway
8516899 but what really incensed me was when i was told i could not change it back to lloyds is pants because they said it was not appropriate
8516900 i asked if it was pants they didnt like and would lloyds is rubbish do but they didnt think so
8516901 so i tried barclays is better and that didnt go down too well either
8516902 the rules seemed to change and they told me it had to be one word so i tried censorship but they didnt like that and then said it had to be no more than six letters long
8516903 it is very disappointing that he felt the need to express his upset with our service in this way customers can have any password they choose and it is not our policy to allow staff to change the password without the customers permission
8516904 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8516905 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8516906 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8516907 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8516908 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8516909 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8516910 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8516911 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
8516912 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
8516913 fundamental to our existence as an independent democratic free state
8516914 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment
8516915 the new nuclear investment the new renewables investment the new investment in clean coal and gas
8516916 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas we are seeing parts of the outlying regions being affected rather than just urban areas
8516917 in the outlying areas health services are maybe less available in a city the services are better such as local access to gps theres also a certain amount of social stigma attached to being obese it may be that these obese people are not going to see their gp however we need to bear in mind that some pcts are better at recording the data than others which could affect the results
8516918 when talking to his socialist friends the parisian will systematically wage a fierce crusade against

8516921 an unsettling psychological thriller which will grip you to the startling unforeseen end
8516922 a desolate country whose soil is rich enough but is given over wholly to weeds a silent mournful expanse a desolation we never saw a human being on the whole route hardly a tree or shrub anywhere even the olive tree and the cactus those fast friends of a worthless soil had almost deserted the country
8516923 a fast walker could go outside the walls of jerusalem and walk entirely around the city in an hour i do not know how else to make one understand how small it is
8516924 the mighty mosque of omar and the paved court around it occupy a fourth part of jerusalem they are upon mount moriah where king solomons temple stood this mosque is the holiest place the mohammedan knows outside of mecca up to within a year or two past no christian could gain admission to it or its court for love or money but the prohibition has been removed and we entered freely for bucksheesh
8516925 well why wouldnt you why do you have to remember that
8516926 i dont understand where they could be its 5 00 pm there and they should be home
8516927 well you have to understand that you are not there so he has to do everything in your absence he has to pick up your son get gas for the car do the grocery shopping pick up dinner etc or maybe he is in the middle of feeding or bathing your son and cant stop to answer the phone give the guy a break
8516928 internet explorer cannot download abc xyz from www mycompany com

8516930 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8516931 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8516932 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8516933 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8516934 im the dude there are lots of surprised of who plays other parts so if you have yet to see it quit bein a loser and get out there i heard a lot about this movie and there was a lot of indie hype around it
8516935 ive actually extended my lead in the championship despite losing two points to felipe
8516936 im mentally strong enough to deal with that and im more relaxed about it too im playing a long game
8516937 clearly i want to win all the tim but ive learned that sometimes its more advantageous to score as many points as possible and live to fight another day
8516938 well actually i work on a blog which explains the ropes of odesk and theres a great book about freelancing on odesk there check that out sign up for an account and just go for it
8516939 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8516940 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8516941 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8516942 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8516943 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8516944 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8516945 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8516946 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8516947 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8516948 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8516949 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8516950 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8516951 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8516952 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8516953 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8516954 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8516955 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8516956 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8516957 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8516958 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8516959 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8516960 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8516961 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8516962 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8516963 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8516964 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8516965 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8516966 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8516967 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8516968 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8516969 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8516970 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8516971 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8516972 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8516973 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8516974 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8516975 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8516976 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8516977 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8516978 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8516979 you like donuts eh well have all the donuts in the world
8516980 localization for ikeadm seems more straightforward when complete phrases are translated rather than a part of a phrase a call to dump foo and more of the phrase it could also accommodate non english grammar more easily
8516981 there were no fresh quotes from the major consuming industries as expected during the week
8516982 but we expect the market to rule firm as the chances for an improvement in arrivals are quite remote in near term
8516983 there were no fresh quotes from the major consuming industries as expected during the week
8516984 but we expect the market to rule firm as the chances for an improvement in arrivals are quite remote in near term
8516985 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8516986 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8516987 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8516988 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8516989 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8516990 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8516991 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8516992 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8516993 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8516994 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8516995 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8516996 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not
8516997 what i havent heard about gas going to 4 a gallon
8516998 is the world a safer place upon his her departure fromt the world stage in all tests gwb is and will always be a great world leader
8516999 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8517000 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8517001 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8517002 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8517003 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8517004 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8517005 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908
8517006 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes
8517007 its going to take a major hit on america with thousands of lives lost before anybody will do anything your son and his mates lives are not enough to get their presidents politicians attention
8517008 i will put my trust in the promises of god and since i am trusting him what can mere man do to me they are always twisting what i say all their thoughts are how to harm me
8517009 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
8517010 no my life is not better off in fact it is worse
8517011 i dont use liberal talking points i excrete liberal talking points
8517012 i dont use liberal talking points i create liberal talking points
8517013 he also says listing to his one sided rhetoric that comes to you via radio station filled with one sided propagandist looking to get rich by blindly riding off his coattail
8517014 anwar has the aura of leader in his presence people tend to be tamed
8517015 the moment he entered the dewan he was instantly surrounded by other pakatan rakyat members including penang chief minister lim guan eng selangor mentri besar tan sri khalid ibrahim dap veteran lim kit siang and pas president datuk seri abdul hadi awang however only three ministers were present in the house for the swearing in
8517016 anwar was sacked as finance minister and the person who lost rm 12 billion of our money gambling on fx was installed as special economic advisor

8517030 i hope we can find a way to move forward
8517031 perhaps you and i could explore ways to improve things
8517032 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8517033 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8517034 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8517035 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8517036 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8517037 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8517038 for an observer on the northern hemisphere the constellation dragon is one of the mightiest and impresses monsters on the sky like a snake he winds his body tail of the dragon through the little and the great bear in direction to the pole star than he bends before the wega and the constellation hercules head of the dragon
8517039 planned to kill barack obama at his acceptance speech by shooting him from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
8517040 is their knowing that they are about to be literally crushed by the tides of world war gathering force around them

8517042 he has a groin problem so he will have an operation and could be out for 10 to 15 days
8517043 it is not serious but we need to do it now
8517044 he has been playing some games in pain not being 100 percent fit and we decided that this was the best moment for the operation
8517045 he had a problem for the first game with liege and also when he went away to play for england in their friendly last week against the czech republic
8517046 we talked with the doctor yesterday and today and it was decided that steven would play in this match with the pain but now we will have to get the situation solved
8517047 his work is tremendous he keeps going right to the end and makes a tremendous contribution to our side
8517048 we knew it would be a difficult game against a quick well organised team

8517058 actually the inspector was wrong we need a lot more repair on the foundation to bring it up to code so itll be more

8517064 this was only a cell culture model and we dont want to give anyone false hope
8517065 we are encouraged by the findings however compounds that show good activity against cancer cells in a model system are most likely to have beneficial effects in our bodies
8517066 products made with processed acai berries have only been available for about five years so researchers in many parts of the world have had little or no opportunity to study them
8517067 a lot of claims are being made but most of them havent been tested scientifically
8517068 we are just beginning to understand the complexity of the acai berry and its health promoting effects

8517093 these responsible dog owners have criticised the irresponsible minority who allow their uncontrolled dogs to knock over little children and pensioners who sometimes need medical treatment or even hospital
8517094 there are a large number of dog walkers in the tendring district and we need to allow sufficient areas where they can exercise their pets
8517095 yes we are better than most of the country but we are still concerned that our children are getting larger we are still in line with the rest of the uk in this respect last year a third of our youngsters were overweight or obese
8517096 for the first time ever this means there is a real chance of children dying before their parents we need to try and encourage everyone to take stock of their own lives think about the little things you can do to make a difference such as walking or running up stairs or going for a bike ride
8517097 it could take 10 years but we need to reduce the reliance on fast food and ready meals and make sure everyone gets their five fruit and veg a day
8517098 we really need to keep an eye on our children theyre not necessarily overweight but we want to make sure they are living right there is proven evidence to show that obesity can cause all kinds of health problems in later years
8517099 i think all gps are seeing lots of obese patients and needless to say they would be more likely to suffer from diabetes strokes and heart attacks and it is a great worry in terms of peoples life expectancy
8517100 more and more people are doing the daily 30 minutes of exercise however there are too many people who were watching the olympics but not going for a jog or a row down the river there are a lot of armchair sports enthusiasts and that needs to change

8517187 the chp gave full support to seven legislative packages for the european union accession process we must not assume that the chp will automatically reject any proposal
8517188 it is in both our interests to achieve success it is in turkeys interest because south africa has all the natural resources that turkey needs turkey has all the infrastructure technology construction expertise and expertise in small and medium enterprises and agriculture that we need in africa we want this relationship to be developed at a much higher level
8517189 everybody is convinced that this is a historic opportunity because africa can provide tremendous benefits for turkey and turkey with its development can provide tremendous benefits for africa
8517190 together we can take our relations politically and economically further of course turkey has applied for a non permanent seat on the u n security council we are discussing this matter and turkey is so strategically situated that it certainly would play a very important role in the security council this is a matter that our government is now discussing and we will give a response soon
8517191 on the level of action almost all major international issues whether it is at the united nations or other multinational institutions will have a common approach
8517192 you must pay attention to dialogue and negotiation and war must be prevented at all costs
8517193 but if turkey can make a major contribution not only generally but also specifically as a member of the security council because of the role it could play in the region nobody can deny turkeys importance strategically it has vast experience in peacekeeping forces post conflict reconstruction and so on
8517194 where there is conflict it makes it difficult for us to cooperate more on the issues of fighting poverty and underdevelopment hiv and terrorism because these conflicts divert attention from the real challenges that humanity faces
8517195 maybe there will be a peaceful solution in georgia and we hope the leaders will rise above very narrow interests and give the georgians peace and stability so if there is stability in georgia it will lead to stability in the region as a whole
8517196 of course we know about the historical role he played in turkey and we are familiar with his writings we see him as a symbol that inspired us in our struggle against apartheid in that sense like nelson mandela he is known by our generation as a revolutionary who brought democracy to turkey therefore we hope to educate our youth to the grandeur and vision of atat rk
8517197 it is clear that he surprised many people in his early campaign he seems to promise some sort of change and to bring some freshness to the american body politic we hope that whoever is elected will be able to deal with the challenges the world faces today
8517198 then there is hospitality of the people the friendliness of the people we all leave very rejuvenated about our visit about the possibilities of extending our relations politically economically culturally with turkey
8517199 we will make the konya road pass through metu and link it with the anadolu boulevard the project will seriously ease the traffic in the capital
8517200 metu however never consented to this project and we cant take its land unless a 1 1 000 scale construction implementation plan is concluded we are thus preparing a 1 5 000 and 1 1 000 scale plans for metu we will then register its territory and build the road regardless if the university wants it or not there are laws and they had to give up the territory
8517201 it is hard to understand what kind of a campaign the mayor is carrying out he always comes up with new demands he appears in the media once every two weeks and challenges saying i will do this and that metu occupies the agenda in the media as a matter of sensation and discussion which isnt true
8517202 he has no right to reproduce the building plans of metu as we have already concluded and submitted them to the ankaya municipality the authority in charge of handling metus building plans our success is their success but the way the municipality carries on isnt healthy
8517203 metu was established as a campus university and has so far maintained its physical development in line with this purpose the project will destroy the territorial integrity of the campus allowing outsiders to enter the campus posing a security risk to campus life
8517204 metu is an eco friendly university which preserves the capitals natural clean and green image the project is likely to be followed by other projects that will lead to construction on the campus
8517205 metu is a public institution and serves for the public interests a municipal plan is hence expected to involve those who study there during its planning phase
8517206 finding enough supplies is the big problem and political lobbying is necessary

8517213 we bought the land in 1943 with the intention of building a new church but due to the war we couldnt build the church
8517214 we have been trying for many years to get back the land but the city government kept saying there is not enough of a basis to settle the dispute
8517215 this has made parishioners upset forcing them to break into the plot earlier this month
8517216 we have not arrested anyone yet but we will if necessary
8517217 mobilized every measure to patiently educate and persuade but the church still refuses to stop its illegal activities
8517218 the city has a wide range of media while the parishioners do not have any forum to raise their voice
8517219 but when i do i would like it to be a bolivian sea
8517220 the sea belongs to us by right to take it back is our duty
8517221 there is a clear historic injustice and the bolivian navy was created as a way of protesting before the whole world
8517222 we are perfectly qualified to sail in any sea in the world and sooner or later god willing we will be sailing in our own sea
8517223 supposedly there are talks but i see no advances no signs of change
8517224 everything is still as it always has been and i think will remain like this
8517225 the conduct we have witnessed in the past few months has been destructive negative divisive violent and reactionary and has damaged the standing of the movement in the province
8517226 i have no enemy in neville mompati and he has no enemy in me
8517227 they do not talk yet we block and mompati talk
8517228 this preliminary emergency appeal launched at the request of the zimbabwe red cross society is therefore intended to provide vital support in responding to the immediate humanitarian needs of 260 100 particularly vulnerable people
8517229 will likely be the worst ever on record the capacity of government to import food is constrained by soaring food prices and the unavailability of foreign currency in the country
8517230 i unhesitatingly respond that turkey can indeed play a positive even important role even though prospects for real breakthroughs are poor in the immediate future
8517231 i think the turkish mediation was important for beginning the negotiations and without being privy to what actually had already been accomplished there it seems to me that the process is important
8517232 turkeys role as a mediator is important and it is uniquely positioned to talk with states like syria and iran where the u s has very little leverage
8517233 the issue is not whether turkey has influence over states like iran and syria but whether turkey is willing to use its influence to further a number of goals most importantly pushing iran towards some kind of compromise on the issue of nuclear enrichment
8517234 also possibly understands better some of the nuances that only people from the region sense
8517235 only the u s is capable and let us hope ready to extend important goods to both sides
8517236 syrian officials have made very clear that they will not conclude an agreement without u s involvement no one expected the bush administration to embrace these talks but they put down a baton that the next u s administration can potentially pick up and support until the u s is ready to play a more active role turkeys efforts remain vital in filling the diplomatic void
8517237 yes america must be involved at one point but turkey could pave the way
8517238 a change of government in israel is unlikely to affect the negotiations in the short term because the current round of indirect talks require very little political capital and require very little commitment at this juncture
8517239 there is a general feeling that in any event the current government would not be able to endorse major foreign policy decisions one might speculate that olmert personally would like to finalize some general outline for an agreement in order to leave some historical memento but even that is unclear and in any event a real full agreement would have to wait until next year
8517240 for over a decade people in the region have seen arab israeli negotiations fail so they tend to be skeptical
8517241 it is important that israel and syria are talking even indirectly but expectations of the talks should be realistic and negotiators should set realist objectives beyond israeli syrian bilateral questions there are a number of strategic and regional issues that will complicate the course of direct negotiations once they begin including the syrian iranian strategic relationship and syrias role in lebanon
8517242 turkey will likely be more effective if it engages in tough diplomacy and uses a combination of carrots and sticks
8517243 turkeys nato traditionalists may be heartened by a return to the core business of the alli ance the defense of members territory and the reaffirmation of alliance security guarantees both nuclear and conventional
8517244 but the implementation of this strategy in turkeys neighborhood would imply a more assertive posture vis a vis moscow closer defense cooperation with washington and brussels and possi bly more uncomfortable ties with arab and muslim neighbors
8517245 none of these things will be popular with the turkish public or with a turkish government accustomed to greater freedom of action in international affairs
8517246 in the near term turkey will face difficult policy choices in reconciling the countrys russian and western interests
8517247 even more difficult dilemmas are on the horizon as a more competitive relationship with rus sia looms and nato is compelled to rethink its own strategy and posture
8517248 the united states and at least some nato allies may go further and opt for significant military assistance to bolster what remains of georgian independence increase the countrys capacity for territorial defense and raise the costs of renewed russian military operations
8517249 all of this will be much more difficult without turkish political and logistical support
8517250 we should not discredit parliament there is no such parliament in terms of representation capability
8517251 being in an argument with the government is different from working together with the government from a distance for the sake of turkey shall we waste our energy to fighting
8517252 i do not have the authority to remit any person i want i can remit convicts not arrested people whose trials are still going on
8517253 i demanded my extraterritorial immunity be removed in that process to be tried
8517254 we want these deaths to stop those who kill and those who die are both our sons
8517255 what link can we have with this affair other than having an acquaintance with turhan mez
8517256 telephone conversations which allegedly belong to me had been made before an arrest warrant on mez was issued i did not make contact with him following an arrest warrant what baffles me is that tapped records of a person under examination are being considered disregarding whether he is involved in a crime or not

8517258 we found the citys restaurants to be excellent featuring the best ingredients culinary talents and a tradition passed on from generation to generation and refined by todays chefs
8517259 there are a lot of great cities in the world
8517260 tokyo is an exciting place to eat but paris is an exciting place to eat so is rome
8517261 i dont think it is helpful to make that kind of statement
8517262 tokyo has the best japanese food in the world but it is nowhere near as diverse as other cities
8517263 i think we can call it the culinary capital of the world
8517264 if you try any cuisine its hard to go wrong in tokyo
8517265 you can find many places that are not publicized at all but are still good especially when you are traveling rural europe
8517266 we have five american films in the competition and most of those films are films with stars so in a way the strike only meant that some of the bigger studio films will only be released late december or january
8517267 but american cinema is very much at the center of the program
8517268 i request you to inform our committee on procedures the municipality launched or will launch against the incident
8517269 some singular incidents are attributed to whole institutions by certain circles imaginary scenarios aim to bring down the reputation of the turkish armed forces
8517270 all attacks on our ability to perform our duties are bound to disappear in the face of our resolve
8517271 personal rights and freedoms are extended with these regulations but separatist terrorists and their legal extensions are encouraged having more room to abuse freedom
8517272 we believe that struggle against terrorism should be conducted without any compromise on human rights but if terrorists are threatening human rights we need to reconsider the balance between rights and freedoms and countermeasures our people too are aware of this necessity a legislation to enable authorities to implement necessary measures within certain spaces for a certain time will contribute enormously to efforts against terrorism
8517273 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point cease fire agreement
8517274 we cannot accept these violations of international law of accords for security and cooperation in europe of united nations resolutions and the taking of a territory by the army of a neighboring country
8517275 were not afraid of anything we will do everything we can to avoid a new cold war if they want relations to worsen they will get it
8517276 natos naval deployments in the black sea where nine foreign vessels have already been sent provoke concern
8517277 it is not accurate to recognize northern cyprus as an independent state
8517278 territorial integrity and national sovereignty of serbia has been violated in the kosovo case
8517279 i know where such a meeting can take place negotiations can be held at the black sea economic cooperation bsec platform of which all five countries are members
8517280 the foreign ministry is engaged in intense diplomacy turkey cannot stay out of the developments turkey will be careful balanced but determined
8517281 he decided to compromise by giving hyatt a chance to fulfill their commitments by managing this serving of alcohol in a secluded restaurant on the 40th floor so he would keep his hotel with the family atmosphere he would like to present to his guests
8517282 that period was basically a family period for vacations and it wouldnt give you the impact on the alcohol ban that much as if you were in the winter season which features business people and international tourists
8517283 current market conditions and the global slowdown create many opportunities for plaza to acquire assets and portfolios at attractive values
8517284 despite the problems in the global credit markets the company continues to experience strong confidence from its financing banks
8517285 the quality of these photographs taken by the abdullah brothers are so high that they could even compete with photographs taken using modern technology today
8517286 they are perfectly colored by hand you cannot see even a spark of silver on them
8517287 princess alexandra invited the abdullah brothers to open a branch in her country
8517288 the abdullah fr res won abdulazizs confidence they were even permitted to take pictures of some female residents of the palace these residents included the sultans two daughters refia and fatma
8517289 love for the ahl al bayt in the ottoman empire
8517290 turkish people are born with the love of ahl al bayt they grow up with the love of ali but for me i live with love of fatma we live in a realm of dreams they are the reality
8517291 the new currency will start circulating jan 1 2009 with the name turkish lira the term new turkish lira was only a tool for the first part of the transition period
8517292 there are other factors in deciding the size of the highest note rather than just inflation rates increasing transactions in the economy is one of them
8517293 currently two thirds of the population have no idea a currency name change is coming
8517294 turkish exports grew not in spite of the central bank but thanks to its efforts
8517295 the management board of gfk announces that it has terminated all discussions in relation to financing for a possible offer and that gfk will therefore not be pursuing an offer for tns
8517296 we do not expect the decline to be as dramatic
8517297 the impact of the credit crisis on the real estate environment and markets everywhere has been unprecedented in recent history
8517298 our franchises have started to purchase goods of far eastern and italian origin
8517299 china has started production in russia china towers are being formed we are trying options such as serbia and ukraine to prevent losses
8517300 due to some political positions there they are pressing turkey the new season is about to be opened and we have to send products urgently however our trucks are kept at the customs for 15 to 20 days
8517301 the prime minister should take action to solve the problem urgently
8517302 olot ja escalfa motors per a una nova edici de la party volc nica cat
8517303 the number of foreign capital utilizing companies among the top 1000 enterprises did not change in 2007
8517304 that is why we prepared the report on the basis of the results of private enterprises this year
8517305 due to the utilization of a new method by the turkish statistical institute in calculating gdp which resulted in a 30 percent increase turkeys first and next top 500 enterprises share in gdp dropped in 2007
8517306 we need a new economic program to change the situation
8517307 such a program should provide medium and long term measures for problems of growth while helping relax the economy in the short term
8517308 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen
8517309 the results were pretty dismal and we dont see a return to the high earnings levels of previous years any time soon
8517310 riskier institutions so that safer institutions wont be unduly burdened
8517311 however we expect to see some migration to areas experiencing the greatest stress
8517312 for me a phase of weakening and a progressive convalescence is the most likely scenario
8517313 after the german economy began the year with a bang that was to be expected i nonetheless foresee more than a simple correction
8517314 domestic demand in particular is developing less strongly than anticipated but this weakness will be temporary
8517315 weak banks should be allowed to disappear from the market
8517316 bad management must be sanctioned a rescue is justified only when there is a threat to the entire financial system
8517317 people just come to the mall to stay cool said chris balberona a driver for a bank who was at manilas megamall watching ice skaters on an artificial rink
8517318 life is hard right now so we dont really come here to shop
8517319 there has been no noticeable decrease in this number primarily because the malling lifestyle has become a way of life for the filipinos
8517320 if you have small kids of course you go to the mall
8517321 you want your kids to be happy because you hardly see them during the work week
8517322 its like they give you everything just so you go
8517323 we can confirm that all the plane passengers have been freed by the hijackers
8517324 they said they belong to slms abdel wahed nur who lives in paris they had coordinated with him to meet them in the french capital
8517325 were a long way from a recovery well see activity at low levels for a while
8517326 it is possible to say that the global crisis has affected us on this issue we were holding talks with a foreign fund that was interested in dyo however the global fluctuation has changed the plans of the fund therefore the negotiations for the sale of a portion of our dyo share stopped
8517327 in fact the group includes the former fund and is also operating in the paint sector however it was not a direct relation now we have signed a letter of intent with the foreign group if we reach an agreement it will be a 50 50 partnership
8517328 we have been planning to invest in a dairy farm in manisa beydere we have decided that accelerating the speed of this investment which eventually will be worth 30 to 35 million will be to delayed until 2009

8517330 the general mohamed ould abdel aziz said nothing has been decided on the militarys non participation in the presidential elections
8517331 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out
8517332 our troops carried out an operation this morning and we have reports that 30 militants including some uzbeks were killed
8517333 there is still a lot of uncertainty on the political front people just want to get out of the market
8517334 its a planted story to try to ridicule mr zardari our party and the country
8517335 china is concerned of the latest development in south ossetia and abkhazia
8517336 the north atlantic council condemns the decision of the russian federation to extend recognition to the south ossetian and abkhazian regions of georgia and calls upon russia to reverse its decision
8517337 norway sees no acceptable legal basis for such a recognition norways support for georgias territorial sovereignty remains
8517338 such a decision makes the situation in the region even more complex
8517339 the formal and legal status of former autonomous provinces in the soviet union gives no legal grounds for the right to self determination to prevail over the need to preserve territorial integrity of internationally recognized countries
8517340 i would prefer to see russia cooperate and integrate with the broadly defined west but if it seeks confrontation it will lose again
8517341 i will continue the agitation unless and until the matter is solved
8517342 you may have a lot of money but we who dont have the money are not as greedy as you

8517344 seems to have made a strategic decision that he will no longer continue negotiations with the bush administration
8517345 they are seeking to expose any divisions among the other five parties on verification
8517346 why be in a rush if you are north korea if you are in a bargaining game whatever your intention is you can string everyone along
8517347 if you disturb serbian territorial integrity so will i that of georgia and recognize independence of abkhazia and south ossetia
8517348 i take nesrin olgun who was the first turkish girl to cross the english channel la manche between england and france in 1979 as an example for myself
8517349 my swimming attempt between bodrum and stank y will be followed by the swimming federation technical committee if successfully swim across the route it will be registered as a record i will take my strokes to the other shore for peace and 26 little swimmers who lost their life in the marmara earthquake in 1999 and are remembered as angels
8517350 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8517351 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8517352 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8517353 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8517354 this is the story of america of women and men who defy the odds and never give up
8517355 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days they are awfully hard to tell apart
8517356 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hangs in the balance
8517357 i share in the joy felt by all malaysians on this historic day this is a victory for the people and its great to be back
8517358 we will restore the integrity of the judiciary fight corruption and build a truly unified nation
8517359 its a decisive victory across races across economic classes for anwar ibrahim its a decisive message calling for change
8517360 he does not have the minimal credibility needed to run the country day by day let alone to take it in the new directions we need to go in a complex world
8517361 if he had continued the slowest he would have run would have been 9 52
8517362 this is his first year of running the 100 meters
8517363 in two more years he should be peaking at this distance and by then i am certain he will be down to there
8517364 ive had some sleep since ive been here so im not tired im trying to get my blood pumping again

8517377 at least a monument could be built for sekou demate conneh as a liberator i would enjoy that
8517378 it is because of these lies and denials that this country truly needs a war crimes court
8517379 these are lies pure lies we were all here and we saw the carnage and mayhem lurd unleashed on armless and defenceless civilians

8517381 juanito has resigned as quintons manager and will now be concentrating on his other up and coming prospects the split was amicable and they have parted on good terms
8517382 i feel like wolfslair can make me go farther than i have been

8517385 there has been a lot interest in the warships and plane submerged in different bays of black island festivals that we organized to introduce our underwater beauties to the world and to improve diving tourism also provided great benefit for us our aim is to increase the diving points other than the black island and thus bring more tourists to our country
8517386 the project aims at improving and popularizing the diving sport which becomes more a hobby instead of a sport with the project even if accomplished late tourists started to flock to underwater in order to endear sea and especially underwater beauties in our country surrounded by seas from three sides we will continue to improve the project with festivals education and tours our aim is to have at least 500 000 people dive into history in one year
8517387 there are over 100 professional divers and teachers in about 60 diving center in 25 regions of bodrum through improving diving tourism we can bring in millions of dollars of foreign currency to our country with foreign tourists
8517388 first of all yassiada sunken rock where underwater carvings exist and unique artifacts are dug out could be opened up for diving tourism furthermore it was indicated that under a project supported by both the chamber of commerce and chamber of sea commerce a wrecked plane and helicopter will be delivered from the air force and will be submerged for tourism in future years
8517389 i thought this sort of thing would only happen in countries that were afraid of terror not my swedish bank
8517390 i have spent half my life in sweden i work as an electrician i live like a normal swede i have never felt this discriminated against
8517391 the bank just follows the eu validation list we have to follow the same rules as other banks
8517392 we will be able to understand our limits better it will be good for the ombudsman to give us concrete directives
8517393 when you look around you see that people either start or cause these feuds out of a lack of education as educated people we are here to solve this problem
8517394 we have met with families that have been feuding for years we tell them that we are children of the region too and that these feuds benefit noone no matter how apprehensive towards peace they are in the beginning our frequent visits eventually bear fruit
8517395 we create places where people can visit with their children and babies
8517396 i had heard such a thing i think there was a document that arrived from the ministry for the hotel bill to be paid that way
8517397 we want to share ideas with the science world and the public on a larger scale we will establish a council with the participation of scientists from the universities representatives from non governmental organizations and our assembly this council will endeavour to find solutions for the high arsenic level in water and to form new water resources
8517398 stop all this happy talk here about how the use of force doesnt make sense

8517409 i thought i served well and really moved good for the first round i went on a good roll
8517410 this takes a little bit of pressure off me because i know a little more about where my game is at

8517414 the university library has an extensive library but i needed more sources
8517415 my womens studies professor told us to take advantage of ohiolink and thats what i went and did
8517416 its a great resource that lots of people dont realize will save you lots of money
8517417 if you need differing sides and opinions youre able to get books from other universities that broaden your knowledge of subjects
8517418 bowling green was one of the first catalogs to be implemented into the ohiolink catalog
8517419 every record in our catalog is in the ohiolink catalog
8517420 i absolutely marveled at the sport i thought it was the neatest coolest sport ever and it really moved me to see guys that were missing limbs passionate about volleyball and im passionate about volleyball and here they were not letting that get in the way of their love of the game when they asked to me help out with the womens team it was a no brainer
8517421 right now its been china and the netherlands as the best in the world but weve been close china come out of the 04 games on top and point wise going in to this the netherlands edged them out and were number three while slovenia is four so weve been in the top four teams for the last four years
8517422 we wont let her being gone effect how we play we have enough senior leadership that we can lead our team keeping the same work ethic we always have
8517423 pretty soon well wonder how we got along without it and it wont even be noticed
8517424 it is exciting to engage students in the campus community
8517425 im kind of an introvert so performing allows me to become extroverted it helps me meet people
8517426 we were hoping they would find in our favor but i think its the reinstatement committee that we really need to talk to
8517427 the staff pretty much did what it has done in the past in this case but the reinstatement committee has the authority to make its own decision so thats where our hope lies
8517428 those two big inside guys for pitt are just like two big fire hydrants
8517429 i was kind of caught off guard and yelled back something like yeah go bg and that is when i realized we should be saying roll along to each other
8517430 its something fans can yell out to each other when they come across each other at a road game like at pittsburgh this weekend
8517431 we may try to make it a chant but there is no specific chant planned yet we hope it just catches on
8517432 we need a chant that doesnt have so many syllables
8517433 bg su has a better chance of being the chant
8517434 i could see it being used at football games especially while the offense is driving down the field
8517435 im looking forward to meeting them more in depth than just saying hey whats going on
8517436 ive watched some game film of them from last year but ive yet to watch them in real life
8517437 i was hard working but never scored a ton of goals by any means
8517438 i was that high energy type of player who would go out and bang keep the puck down low to protect it and give that little bit of life to the game that we needed
8517439 his familiarity with our school makes it a lot easier

8517473 for a 200 investment weve made we got featured in the local newspaper once twice on tv and its the buzz around town i cant get a quarter page ad for 200
8517474 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8517475 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8517476 it is about time that people of bihar stop whining about the other parts of the country caring less about them they need to start caring about themselves that has not happened in a long time the floods are not something new the scale may be unprecedented and the tv cameras may be on bihar but this happens year after year
8517477 in my village not very far off the kosi belt the bridge that links my village to the main road was breached in 2003 and is still not being built its a huge area that the bridge links i dont see any reason why it is not being rebuilt many such bridges should have been built
8517478 i am not blaming the centre i am saying the kind of attention to be given because of problems that the state has been facing is not adequate
8517479 many more people in bihar are capable of doing much more than what they are already doing for the state i also endorse the view that was mentioned by dr abhay singh that people of bihar are capable of doing much more
8517480 when i am outside india i am a proud indian and when i hear anything against india i always retaliate being in india i am a proud bihari and i always try to retaliate to what others say about bihar
8517481 the state has some problems like other states but what bihar is facing the nation must know
8517482 we face bangladesh on the eastern side and on the northern side we have naxalite infested state nepal which is creating problems for us and from andhra through chattisgarh and jharkhand we again face the naxals these are just one set of problems
8517483 do you think it is because of the water in bihar
8517484 the real problem is that 1 5 lakh usage water is left from nepal they are threatening to leave some more because of the water being left from there we have a problem in bihar
8517485 we are facing a political problem we are facing natural calamities but what is the centre doing for us
8517486 some people from bihar go out and even change their accent to claim that they are not biharis
8517487 there should be biharis like dr ajay kumar radha singh and thakur to come back to bihar and do the work rather than sit outside
8517488 just because i criticise things in bihar i am no less proud bihari but pride in bihar should not blind you to what ails that state
8517489 scientists and water management people have been predicting this breach for at least a month now people on both sides of the border have been sitting and watching the breach there is a dispute i am told between the bihari contractors and nepali contractors on what amounts will be paid to keep the embankments and barrage in place
8517490 this is a man made flood that is taking so many lives i spoke to people in indian embassy in nepal today and they told me that bihar government did not alert them alarmingly enough of what the situation of the kosi river was

8517711 hasnt been paying as much attention as he could have been
8517712 ive noticed a trend when they retire all of a sudden
8517713 in my opinion its maryellen and her staff and with jack
8517714 blaming it on transportation department head john franklin would be so unfair he was given the tools he was given and the staff he had
8517715 they seem to have a handle on it and people are getting through i heard that today for the first time
8517716 there has to be accountability for what happened we just cant have this its just been nightmarish for everybody concerned
8517717 all im asking for is someone to respond and call me back
8517718 he has a hard enough time with school without being on the bus for two hours
8517719 she needs to know how much parents have had to spend
8517720 its the frustration of it all you cant really put a price on frustration its put a hardship on a lot of people
8517721 under a homeland security structure its important to figure out what needs to be done in the case of a situation like this
8517722 we think port security is hugely important for our nation and really needs to be addressed
8517723 view a governor being able to affect their daily lives and a vice president not as much floridians want him to remain their governor
8517724 prefer the first term governor stay in tallahassee and do the job he was elected to do less than two years ago
8517725 i think its fair to say the poll shows florida is a very competitive state and might be at the epicenter of the presidential election again
8517726 the numbers will be a little bit artificial until a couple of weeks into september
8517727 the fact that he cant close the deal with florida voters shows they are hungry for change
8517728 i came in third that seems to be the way the script is written
8517729 that can be my swan song and i ride off into the great beyond
8517730 i had to give my first priority to preparing for this election and the changeover of the voting system as far as the campaigning i felt i was at a tremendous disadvantage
8517731 its hard to throw your hat into a public office for this kind of a job when he took it
8517732 i think the voters are just interested in having somebody else
8517733 kelan ka titigil at napapagod ako sa yo samahan mo ko dito sa gitna ng stage
8517734 the itunes business model works brings in money for us too but we lack price differential control apple wont let us we hate that
8517735 it might be that all it takes is a few good men to do nothing for evil to flourish but it only takes one or two good men to take things too far for injustice to flourish
8517736 but with the advent of the fact checking obsessed blogosphere
8517737 only if they have to check facts presented by someone they genuinely dislike and only in the 5 minutes when the subject is hot
8517738 view a governor being able to affect their daily lives and a vice president not as much floridians want him to remain their governor
8517739 prefer the first term governor stay in tallahassee and do the job he was elected to do less than two years ago
8517740 i think its fair to say the poll shows florida is a very competitive state and might be at the epicenter of the presidential election again
8517741 the numbers will be a little bit artificial until a couple of weeks into september
8517742 the fact that he cant close the deal with florida voters shows they are hungry for change
8517743 mike wolf people take it very seriously when they come to a national tournament it is not a fun weekend tournament that they are going to the teams are very serious when they come here to play
8517744 dies ist ein kleiner schritt f r einen menschen ein gro er schritt f r die menschheit
8517745 mike wolf people take it very seriously when they come to a national tournament it is not a fun weekend tournament that they are going to the teams are very serious when they come here to play
8517746 create an event in ical or outlook the change syncs with mobileme within 15 minutes and updates your iphone and ipod touch
8517747 so perhaps a ruby expert could add the logic for an if then statement to say basically
8517748 those 65 or older have long been the poor population and that really has changed for a very short window 30 or at the most 40 years
8517749 now were seeing a contraction of those income support systems that supported the elderly namely social security and worker pensions
8517750 i have five grandchildren and i wonder what kind of world will their grandchildren have
8517751 with plane fare hotel and extra expenses it would have been way over 1 000 and im on a very fixed income
8517752 el gobierno en acuerdo con la empresa privada considerando que es deber del estado proteger los derechos de los consumidores fij los precios m ximos de venta al p blico de manera temporal a varios productos de la canasta b sica alimenticia

8517754 they were incredibly close their two characters just got married
8517755 like other members of the cast and crew jolene is struggling to come to terms with the death of her dear friend overnight
8517756 he was a talented and spirited student who continued to follow his passion for drama after leaving the college
8517757 the only certainty is that the vehicle was light coloured and the make and model cant be confirmed from witness accounts
8517758 there are other possible sightings of ciara further along stirling highway so it cant be confirmed if she did or did not get into this vehicle
8517759 no one wants to invest their time and money to go back to school and not see the return later on
8517760 on the other hand its a good time to go to school and hopefully the economy will be better when they complete their mba
8517761 when the economy starts to go into a slide enrollments go up
8517762 and after they graduate theyll have greater stability and faster career progression
8517763 they look more at the micro level is wall street hiring
8517764 has caused some people in our class to widen their net
8517765 students arent feeling the doom and gloom of the economy here
8517766 nationally were seeing companies scaling back on their recruiting but locally we have more recruiters than ever a lot of it is because energy companies are doing so well
8517767 but they may not be putting as much into traditional financial markets because theres not as much return i think theyll go more toward small business and startups if you can show them a very bright idea
8517768 most of us see this economic slowdown as just part of the economic cycle and expect the economy to pick back up soon
8517769 one third of my classmates are international and most classes have some international focus that really helps us see the changes in the u s and abroad as opportunities
8517770 many students are likely to consider taking a job overseas
8517771 there is still no better place than the u s as far as having the infrastructure in place transparency and the opportunity to obtain
8517772 so were not reliant totally on our own marketing resources to do that
8517773 over time the subscriber growth will be much more a function of cable and international distribution deals
8517774 these comparisons are totally unacceptable and take credibility away from the very real objections made about these cuts
8517775 civilized political discourse as canadians gear up for what is expected to be a fall election
8517776 the comparison of canadas prime minister to nazi leader adolf hitler is obscene and offensive
8517777 such statements trivialize the holocaust and inject ugly rhetoric in what ought to be reasoned debate on real and pressing political issues
8517778 we must wonder about the sincerity of a government that recognizes the people of quebec as a nation when it does not hesitate to cut into the very heart of its existence culture
8517779 in addition to ensuring the financial stability of dozens of organizations across canada the financial support of government facilitates the collection of private donations which in turn can promote production here and abroad
8517780 six policemen and a civilian have been killed the prison bus was on its way to the jail to pick up prisoners for their court hearings
8517781 near the bridge on kurram river an explosive laden vehicle was already parked when the bus approached the vehicle the explosives were detonated by a remote control
8517782 newcastle united mengumumkan bahwa telah menerima permintaan tertulis untuk dijual dari james milner klub sangat menyesal karena ia merupakan anggota yang bernilai buat kami
8517783 saya bahkan tidak ingin berbicara mengenai kemungkinan kehilangan james milner
8517784 dia pemain penting bagi kami dia memiliki masa depan dan semakin baik dari hari ke hari
8517785 certainly we would hope its not a trend certainly theres a level of society which will do this sort of thing and i would hope that any scrap metal merchant that they were taken to wouldnt accept them or would in fact contact the police
8517786 the council has recorded bronze sculptures and statues steel rubbish bins copper flashing and even stormwater grates stolen recently
8517787 if i didnt have a helmet on id be out i would be taking a long nap right there
8517788 these misconceptions enable christians to be in a state of denial about their conversion efforts and these myths often inhibit the kind of relationships and environments in which people can be deeply changed by their faith in jesus
8517789 in europe as a whole little can be done missionally with the existing institutional church its over
8517790 if someone had told me 45 years ago of what were about to witness i would say youre crazy youre out of your mind
8517791 it is a major major step in making real the hopes and dreams and aspirations of so many americans who attended the march and who supported the march
8517792 the democratic party has come such a distance from 1963
8517793 under the leadership of people like jimmy carter bill clinton and all that lyndon johnson said sen obama is the personification of what the democratic party is about
8517794 a dirty and nasty word we cannot be patient we do not want to be free gradually
8517795 i just dont know whats going to be my reaction
8517796 we were able to flip the cell from one state into another
8517797 any case where theres a cell type missing and there are neighboring cells that are still healthy
8517798 you wouldnt be transplanting cells so you wouldnt be dealing with immune issues
8517799 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
8517800 its aggravating to us over 600 flights were affected which is about 60 000 people because of one computer glitch
8517801 we were doing a normal daily software load that we do a couple times a day
8517802 as we were doing the software load something got corrupted in the file and it brought the system down
8517803 this is one of the largest project management challenges the u s government has had since we put somebody on the moon
8517804 it used to be an elite thing theyve taken street art and they make the galleries come to them
8517805 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8517806 prudence would dictate that we leave the text as it is until our candidate catches up with us
8517807 i want to give him a platform he can run on
8517808 the work for the people of california and to solve this budget problem is the most important thing right now for me
8517809 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8517810 failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8517811 to defend the social and economic rights of the poor and oppressed
8517812 to deplore the historic involvement of the church in american with racism
8517813 challenge the misplaced trust of the nation in economic and military might a proud trust that promotes a national pathology of war and violence
8517814 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8517815 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8517816 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8517817 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8517818 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8517819 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8517820 jackson hattiesburg laurel and all areas along the coast its a little mexico
8517821 im not against people trying to make living i have a compassion for those folks but at the same time the taxpayers of mississippi shouldnt be subsidizing a plant that wont even hire their own workers
8517822 i need a job and got kids i heard that they need some help now
8517823 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs
8517824 that doesnt justify but it certainly explains why they might be hiring individuals who show up and say ill work for you
8517825 our studies show that with only three out of every 10 people of military age being capable of joining the army we are going to have to do something different
8517826 its a tough structured day some of them have sat on the couch for 18 years but i havent heard any howling yet
8517827 theres no jobs out there nothing its just horrible and it got hard just trying to support myself and go to school at the same time
8517828 we have two missions get the ged and prepare them physically and mentally for basic training
8517829 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8517830 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8517831 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8517832 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8517833 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and country lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8517834 i move that sen barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8517835 its a little like a funeral but its closure and its one final step
8517836 its symbolic we only got to vote in a hotel room
8517837 im glad its unanimous however i wanted texas to get its chance to vote
8517838 its my very first time and i am very excited
8517839 this primary was so close it generated so much excitement we have two great candidates i just wanted to be here
8517840 no more tea trolley no more snack attack in the afternoon
8517841 i cannot accept that jesus is the only way to god to truth
8517842 friendship in loving with deeds sacrifice acceptance safety benevolence etc

8517844 the history art music and religion of india hold important lessons for all of us as we strive to be better citizens of our own community and the world on behalf of umass dartmouth i thank the three rs foundation for its exemplary generosity
8517845 we are excited to be part of this educational initiative that will allow umass dartmouth students to learn about india at a time when the information super highway and global economy are creating important east west connections among our highest priorities is to develop innovative teaching strategies rooted in indian culture
8517846 today the three rs foundation is reviving that learning system from its source and creating a program which could be a breakthrough even beyond lozanovs this deserves all our encouragement and support
8517847 an endowment of this size to bridge ancient civilization of india to
8517848 i am thrilled at this opportunity and look forward to facilitating the engagement of my colleagues in this educational mission
8517849 israel missed a chance to learn from the most influential musicians of the decade and the beatles missed an opportunity to reach out to one of the most passionate audiences in the world
8517850 on our 60th anniversary we would like to take the opportunity to offer you a second chance to play in israel
8517851 after my father was unable to listen to the beatles
8517852 i love paula wagner but she wants to produce elsewhere and in her own venue and i dont intend to stand in her way ill say this of her leaving united artists whatever paula wants is what i want her to have and i hope well continue working together on future projects
8517853 it just doesnt make sense to me either the moment i read the screenplay i knew it was an important story and as its a true tale of heroic resistance to one of the great villains of history i cant imagine that people wont want to see it
8517854 well im always looking for something new and bens movie is hilarious he and i are old friends and he is a really good director so originally i said id do it just for friendship but it turned out great i actually love comedy and i did it in risky business so ill do more if it presents itself im also always looking for a good love story and i think i have one in a coming international thriller called the tourist i believe i will be doing that
8517855 things are going really well for katie and well see you on opening night sept 18
8517856 oh yes shes so charming shes so beautiful shes just great
8517857 more beautiful than say sky and far more beautiful than beautiful
8517858 the armored cars of dreams contrived to let us do so many a dangerous thing
8517859 there are a few players that are coming in with a chance to make an impression to have a shot at filling some gaps we have for the world baseball challenge
8517860 iwata has played for us in a couple tournaments before
8517861 hes a quality individual and can do a lot of things he can play second third or catch he has a tremendous arm and is outstanding defensively hes a slap type hitter quick on the basepaths
8517862 he spent three years in the san francisco giants organization
8517863 he pitched for italy at the world baseball challenge in 2002 and has pitched in the grand forks international a couple of times before and has never lost a game he is so interested in being part of the world baseball challenge host team that he is paying his own way to come up from just south of portland
8517864 and pitcher jason cage named to the wbc team already hes going to be playing in the gfi for the first time thatll be a lot of fun to see them its always fun to see a grand forks rookie its the closest thing that these players will experience to the world baseball challenge before it arrives here next year thats by measuring size of crowds quality of facility and the level of play on the field
8517865 the studs were the team that lost to cuba in the final of the wbc in 2002
8517866 theyre a very well coached and very well versed team
8517867 ik dacht toen dat de federale regering de achterblijvers te hulp zou komen
8517868 ik had het mis we gaan die fout niet herhalen
8517869 zijn we klaar om te evacueren de grote vraag is in welke staat onze dijken verkeren er is hard aan gewerkt en ik ben voorzichtig optimistisch
8517870 the university is delighted with ibms latest business growth decision as it will enhance the levels of collaboration between the enterprise and the university
8517871 the only drop in natively interoperable alternative to microsoft exchange
8517872 the acquisition of postpath complements our strategy to develop an integrated collaboration platform designed for how we work today and into the future providing real productivity gains and a more satisfying user experience
8517873 our cloud based delivery model offers our customers rapid deployment and compelling economics
8517874 for its expansion into australia and new zealand the company chose navteq map data due to its excellent quality and coverage
8517875 weve engineered a low cost masterpiece of graphics processing technology
8517876 this is the new wave in next generation capabilities and now is the time to catch it
8517877 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8517878 this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8517879 squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people
8517880 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8517881 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8517882 they have linked their action to not being taken off the state sponsor of terrorism list
8517883 the other members of the six party talks have made it clear that the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for pyongyangs nuclear programme
8517884 so thats not a new demand thats a longstanding demand its not just a us demand its a demand by the other five members of the six party talks
8517885 hes been so defined by his opponents and his detractors
8517886 i dont think hes aggressively stepped up to define who he is yet
8517887 i havent seen any movement toward him since the primaries
8517888 he needs to project that he understands in his heart and soul the needs of this country and the needs of all americans no matter their upbringing
8517889 hes not a populist its not where he is comfortably authentically one of the challenges is how he gets there authentically
8517890 he needs to reach out more to hillary and stop acting like he doesnt need her
8517891 helaas moeten we vaststellen dat er ondanks de goednieuwsshow rond het marshallplan daar ten gronde niets verandert ronduit dramatisch is de situatie in brussel waar een sociale tijdbom tikt
8517892 het is onlogisch om heel vlaanderen te vergelijken met een stad als brussel
8517893 in vlaanderen zijn er evengoed gemeentes of regios waar er meer leefloners zijn dan in gemeenten en provincies in walloni het is trouwens n van de prioriteiten van de staatssecretaris om mensen met een leefloon aan een job te helpen
8517894 i actually think its inevitable twenty20 cricket will be an olympic sport
8517895 you think about the audiences in the sub continent 22 or 23 per cent of the worlds population is based in that area
8517896 the ioc could do a lot worse than put cricket into the olympics
8517897 the critical issue with the game of twenty20 cricket is how do we make it work
8517898 the reason i say that is not because i want to go off and play its not about that
8517899 i want to play for australia as much as i can i want to play as many tests for australia as i can
8517900 i want the next generation of australian players to have that dream to put on the baggy green cap and play 100 test matches and 300 one day games
8517901 im worried if theres not that period of time be it in the ipl or the epl or whatever competition it might be that this next generations opinions might change
8517902 because 10 per cent of bsf is it money and the programme has been running for a few years now a lot more money is being spent on it in education than before it started
8517903 it punches above its weight in terms of its transformational impact and it is the innovative it environments and equipment that are almost as likely as the buildings to have that impact
8517904 schools develop an output specification and the ict partner proposes solutions that match the schools strategy for change
8517905 they have a shared learning platform that supports the every child matters agenda and are looking at how adaptive and enabling technologies can support all learners
8517906 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8517907 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8517908 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8517909 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8517910 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8517911 could regain hurricane strength within the next day or two
8517912 we are continuing to monitor this storm as state government agencies including the state police and the louisiana national guard have been put on standby so we are ready to quickly respond if the storm heads our direction
8517913 when you have a major disturbance like bleaching it can affect a huge area of the reef
8517914 if you have extensive reserve systems then the chances are much higher they will contain small areas within that escape bleaching which can help to recharge the reef as a whole
8517915 the great barrier reef marine park authority have put a lot of effort into determining exactly where these protected zones should be located to give the reef the best over chance of recovery from bleaching events
8517916 new protected zones need to focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts
8517917 the crown prosecution service wishes to make it clear that this prosecution was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shia muslims indeed the prosecution relied as part of its evidence upon the president of the local shia community centre
8517918 the law exists to protect the young from harm or being exposed to harm in this case both boys were made to take part in the ritual flagellation and suffered injuries to their backs
8517919 this man not only abused the vulnerability of these children but also went against the wishes of his own community as well as knowingly breaking the law
8517920 i am honoured to be here tonight a proud mother a proud democrat a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8517921 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
8517922 i think im playing really well right now a lot better than i was last year
8517923 last year was kind of nerve wracking being a 15 year old in the league but this year im a lot more comfortable with everyone and i can just go out there and play
8517924 i have to raise my skill level playing with bigger guys in front of friends and family theres a lot of pressure and even being a first rounder brings a lot of expectations you just have to be the best you can be i think ive done that so far in this camp
8517925 i was obviously happy to end my minor hockey career with a provincial championship i learned a lot last year and i think this year i can come in and work hard and put up some numbers
8517926 we just barely made playoffs last year and things just fell into place and we were one win away from the telus cup so it was a good season
8517927 exactly what we wanted to happen has happened he worked hard on his body and has made himself a bit bigger and stronger and hes been very good in training camp
8517928 he went back to the midget program and had a very good year they did a tremendous job with him and you can tell hes matured theres no question in our minds hes ready to go here
8517929 i just thought it wouldnt be smart to go into midget out of shape its really fast here lots of strong guys out there with lots of skill i was nervous at the start but i think ive done really good now that im starting to get into it playing my game
8517930 jesse was a huge part of that team that went to the western canadians and hes done exactly what we expected
8517931 hes going to be a great player for us here
8517932 our findings suggest that individuals presenting with features of inherited rcc susceptibility should be screened for germ line sdhb mutations because surveillance for sdhb related tumors can then be offered to mutation positive patients and relatives
8517933 it is entirely appropriate at this time to counsel patients carrying sdhb mutations espe cially those with arg mutations that they have a small but finite likelihood of developing rcc
8517934 die britische regierung l gt und betr gt sie t uscht und verz gert herr vorsitzender wenn sie nicht jetzt mit ganzer kraft t tig werden geh ren sie bald auch zu den opfern
8517935 i cant believe youve all turned out for me im overwhelmed its a journey that came out of sorrow and pain and heartache but its a journey that has turned to joy
8517936 thank you for the most beautiful welcome anyone could have this is a dream come true and i hope everyones dreams come true
8517937 the death of my husband clive from prostate cancer taught me more than anything about how precious life is how short it can be that you have to grab life do what you can while you can and try to give something back
8517938 if i can spread the message to people to get checked out all this will have been worth it
8517939 our hope is that this research will improve the screening process for migraine in soldiers and increase education about migraine for soldiers and their health care providers u s military personnel should receive the best health care available and improving the diagnosis and treatment of migraine will likely improve soldiers personal and professional functioning
8517940 our findings suggest that increased brain connections during chronic drug use may actually limit behavioral changes associated with drug addiction rather than support them
8517941 relapse or the resumption of active drug taking and drug seeking is very common in drug addicts
8517942 addiction related brain changes and behaviors seem to be hardwired and semipermanent and there are limited treatment options our data suggest that rather than trying to block the process of increasing dendritic spine density we may actually want to look at treatments that try to enhance this process
8517943 this suggests the exciting possibility that mef2 proteins may control expression of key genes that modulate drug related brain changes and behavior
8517944 if we understand which genes are influenced by mef2 we can intervene and try to help the system resist or reverse these sensitization processes
8517945 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
8517946 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
8517947 sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plastic the next day

8517951 tests for perfect pitch have always demanded that subjects already have some musical training or at least familiarity with a particular piece of music which really limits the pool of candidates you can test

8517953 from this nationally representative telephone survey we estimate that more than 4 3 million u s adults are taking opioids regularly in any given week

8517958 he is said to have defined a well governed city by stating that city where those who have not been injured take up the cause of one who has and prosecute the case as earnestly as if the wrong had been done to themselves

8517960 with or without religion you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things
8517961 steven weinberg quoted in the new york times april 20 1999
8517962 voting booth web page i suppose he blames the stanford board for his predation on the young men who responded to his ad for research subjects
8517963 any deed that any human being has ever committed however horrible is possible for any of us under the right or wrong situational circumstances that knowledge does not excuse evil rather it democratizes it sharing its blame among ordinary actors rather than declaring it the province only of deviants and despots of them but not us
8517964 the big difference is that the new system has a lot more memory so what happened yesterday could never happen again
8517965 resulted in the wrong configuration data being loaded onto the switch
8517966 i never write the yankees off until the seasons over and the standings are set

8517972 as of now the consulate is looking after the survivors but soon they have to sort out their papers and take the first flight home about 42 workers have been given shelter at a labour accommodation located in al quoz we have also allocated some funds to them for their survival
8517973 other researchers have suggested in the past that nk cells might not always be good for you but we now have the first direct evidence that this can actually be the case
8517974 although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximize their beneficial role
8517975 when patients go to the emergency room the doctors really cant help a lot the cocaine is still in their system

8517999 we face a period which may offer significant opportunities to grow lap there may of course be further decreases in commercial property values in the short term as well as tenant defaults however we believe lap is as well placed as possible to weather such eventualities and we therefore look forward to the next six months with confidence
8518000 the development program for this new product was based on options long standing relationship with the vodafone group a stylish design is important for mass market appeal while the unprecedented growth of voice and data traffic in the 2100mhz band is making hspa support in the 900 mhz band a commercial imperative our new device is the first commercially available hspa expresscard in the world to incorporate support for that 900mhz band
8518001 oncomethylome sciences ondergaat in 2008 een transformatie in noord amerika zijn twee tests die onze technologie bevatten gelanceerd het schenkt ons buitengewoon veel voldoening te weten dat pati nten nu toegang hebben tot deze nieuwe tests voor colorectale en prostaatkanker momenteel werkt onze commerci le partner labcorp ook aan de lancering van de mgmt methylatietest
8518002 terwijl oncomethylome zal blijven werken met zorgvuldig gekozen distributiepartners zullen wij ook in toenemende mate een actievere rol gaan spelen in de commercialisering van onze producten op belangrijke europese markten daartoe evalueren wij onze opties voor het lanceren van onze producten op de europese markt
8518003 wij hebben een beperkt nazicht uitgevoerd van de geconsolideerde tussentijdse balans per 30 juni 2008 de geconsolideerde resultatenrekening en kasstroomtabel samen de
8518004 2008 is turning out to be a transformational year for oncomethylome sciences two testing services that contain our technology were launched in north america it is incredibly rewarding to know that patients are now able to access these new colorectal cancer and prostate cancer tests currently our commercial partner labcorp is also preparing the launch of the mgmt methylation testing service
8518005 while oncomethylome will continue to work with select distribution partners we will also increasingly take a more active role in the commercialization of our products in core european markets to that end we are evaluating our options for bringing our products to the european market
8518006 we have performed a limited review of the consolidated balance sheet as of june 30 2008 the consolidated income statement and the cash flow statement jointly the
8518007 american businesses and consumers were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
8518008 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited
8518009 but the bigger picture is that there hasnt really been a major breakdown considering all the bad headlines out there from higher oil prices to the credit crisis and troubled housing sector
8518010 the market continues to question the same things and were not really getting any answers
8518011 i think thats one of the reasons why people are staying on the sidelines
8518012 hopefully we will not have to make any cuts in north carolina at this time we dont have that on the drawing board

8518021 oh wow ok then you guys are ahead of the game
8518022 if you look at obamas indiana primary and where he got votes from he got more votes from white folks than he got from black folks thats a reality
8518023 look at carmel and hamilton county he beat hillary rodham clinton in carmel so theres a wider acceptance and its going to evolve
8518024 since iowa when obamas caucus win propelled his campaign ive been so overcome with just a sense that we have moved a lot further than i had originally thought
8518025 as a group they would never collectively say im not voting for somebody based on their race
8518026 these union members are people i have worked for and worked with its a sad day in our country that we would turn our feelings of race to an advantage for someone that we dont believe in or agree with on the issues and thats republican presidential candidate john mccain
8518027 we need to have the clintons and evan bayh and former u s rep lee hamilton working to turn some of these numbers around
8518028 i just cant take it anymore god please give me the sweet release of death
8518029 bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye byyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeee
8518030 barack obama will bring down health care costs by 2 500 for the typical family and at long last deliver affordable accessible health care for all americans
8518031 they took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs down to 5 million from an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and half million falling into poverty and million more losing their health insurance
8518032 john mccain has served his country with honor but his refusal to change course even in the face of the failed policies of bush cheney is reckless and will not keep us safe
8518033 sen mccain says that american troops should remain in iraq perhaps as long as they have been stationed in korea and japan as if there were no difference in history religion or culture between our friends in asia and those in the middle east
8518034 weve been in south korea weve been in japan for 60 years weve been in south korea for 50 years or so thatd be fine with me as long as americans as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed then its fine with me i hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al qaida is training recruiting and equipping and motivating people every single day
8518035 in the last two years sen obama helped pass the new gi education bill
8518036 sen mccain and the republicans have centered their answer to our vital energy needs on one solution offshore drilling sen mccain calls for it in every speech white house analysts congressional analysts and the oil industry all agree that offshore drilling wont add one drop to our energy pool for at least 10 years will it do any harm the answer is we just dont know and neither does he

8518120 i felt it was important to be with our students on my first day as well as with our senior leadership group and other members of this community
8518121 our students are engaged involved and interested in what is happening on their campus
8518122 we can only go as far as the campus constituency is willing to go in order to create what i hope will be a bold vision for ohio wesleyan that vision has to be organic and should grow out of the essence of what this institution is
8518123 they value the education they received at ohio wesleyan their professors and their lifelong owu friends and they want the university to retain its academic strength
8518124 ohio wesleyan is a community of learners a place that inspires passion where people care deeply about one another
8518125 when i got home and i saw a neighbour come across with her husband i was gripped with dread i couldnt believe what she was telling me the police called later and said they still dont know where the family are

8518131 i can think of no greater adventure and no greater place than ohio wesleyan
8518132 and im appreciative and humbled by whats happened to the book since its release
8518133 ive been living with the characters and their world and what i was trying to say for such a long time trying to get it right that the public reception is a bit of a wow experience at the same time it feels a little unreal like being on the outside looking in
8518134 the book is called far bright star and the publication date has been set for may 2009
8518135 people are eagerly setting up their computers to access our new wireless network
8518136 its important to remember that a campus wide wireless network implementation is an incredibly complex project so there will inevitably be some hiccups during the process

8518143 the imams studied the gospel of john and the christians studied the harder portions of the quran
8518144 the christians got a beautiful sense of the quran intermingled with an intense understanding of the history of the times the linguistics and other issues surrounding the interpretation of the text
8518145 the experience gave me a lot of curricular content i can apply directly to our work with the common text groups on campus and at the marion correctional institution
8518146 the hartford seminary in connecticut prepares muslim seminarians for chaplaincy and ohio wesleyan will soon have the first placement of one of these seminarians
8518147 the selection of ohio wesleyan was based on many factors including our common text outreach in marion and the good work being done with our muslim students association the hartford people have a sense that ohio wesleyan is the right environment for this placement
8518148 an honor for me because of my passionate interest in christian muslim dialogue however it was more than that ohio wesleyan had a real place at the table with our institutional peers because of what we are creating here others were sometimes amazed at the kinds of interfaith work that is taking place on this campus it felt good to be representing ohio wesleyan
8518149 this was a gathering of delegates from the 775 methodist educational institutions throughout the world
8518150 what fascinated me was that 30 of those schools were either founded by or significantly attached to ohio wesleyan alumni in the late 1800s ohio wesleyan sent so many missionaries into the field that their influence is still felt today not only in the united states but also in south america asia and africa

8518289 el aut ntico compromiso con galicia se plasma con partidas presupuestarias y no con promesas

8518300 que al menos por una vez no enga e a los gallegos y diga la verdad sobre los plazos para la construcci n del ave

8518315 establish that the accused was not entitled to the amounts that he claimed and received as the result of his dishonest conduct
8518316 it is incumbent on the prosecution to do this in order to establish to the necessary degree that the accused had an intent to defraud when he forged and uttered the documents in support of his claims
8518317 in the circumstances it is not necessary to make any finding as to whether or not the accused had an honest belief that he was entitled to claim as he did
8518318 for these reasons i conclude that while the accused acted dishonestly in making the claims that he did it has not been established that he did so with the necessary intent to defraud
8518319 accordingly in due course there will be a judgment of acquittal in respect of each of the charges
8518320 im very pleased its been a very significant toll on myself and my family

8518447 i just talked to him nice said bishop who was traded to the roughriders on saturday for a conditional pick in the 2011 cfl draft
8518448 he understands that when you come from another club that you have a favourite number the talks went smooth
8518449 i felt good in it but i feel better in no 17 bishop said
8518450 im trying to get more familiar with the offensive line and the receivers bishop said
8518451 it will take time for everything to gel but after day 2 im still completing passes and having fun i have to feel good about that
8518452 the main thing is understanding how the receivers are going to take their routes bishop said
8518453 it will take some time but so far it has been good
8518454 i know enough to manage the game if im called upon bishop said
8518455 ive played football for a long time so if the opportunity comes along i will take it
8518456 he is already fairly familiar with our run game miller said
8518457 he is able to be use his feet and that dynamic is really good our passing game is slightly different than how we did it before so he has to pick up on that
8518458 an offence goes through a normal progression and evolution miller said
8518459 even some of the same route patterns that weve named the same have gone through a slight evolution those things are different from he was used to so we have to get him up to speed on those we have about 50 to 70 of them so there are some nuances that he has to pick up

8518490 i meant just for balance so you dont fall again

8518503 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
8518504 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8518505 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
8518506 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
8518507 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
8518508 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8518509 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
8518510 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8518511 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8518512 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8518513 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
8518514 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
8518515 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year

8518517 de marechaussee was al op zoek naar deze jongen ze wisten alleen zijn bijnaam coco ik heb gehoord dat hij inmiddels is opgepakt
8518518 de autoriteiten wilden de oorzaak om een of andere reden niet met ons delen we hoorden van de captain dat aan boord in elk geval geen sprake was van een actieve kaping of ander actief geweld
8518519 het heeft allemaal veel te lang geduurd als er sprake is van een beoogde kaping dan laat je mensen niet zo lang in een vliegtuig zitten met de kapers ze hadden ons dan al eerder uit het vliegtuig kunnen halen
8518520 the principal opposition party in west bengal does not know how to tackle a situation using practical sense and logic

8518525 my children are so young they dont understand everything in the sermon
8518526 but i have a squirmer it is difficult for me to worship and pay attention during the service
8518527 people began to call upon the name of the lord
8518528 it has been said that modern people worship their work work at their play and play at their worship we need to work at our worship with children we often have to work harder
8518529 we are new to the reformed faith my kids are accustomed to going to a youth program during the service
8518530 much of the service feels rote and routine i am concerned that my children will think worship is lifeless and mechanical

8518546 not only because people seemed to really appreciate it but because talking to farmers was like some kind of therapy so nice and relaxing made me want to quit journalism and become a farmer

8518552 oslama will rise form the oceans which will boil and froth during the hawaiian vacation
8518553 bush ruined the economy mccain is the same as bush
8518554 weve heard a lot about how bush has mismanaged the economy but theres no evidence of this
8518555 in fact incomes began growing in 2003 after falling in 2001 and 2002 and have trended upward every year since the small bump in 2003 was followed by gains of 2 291 in 2004 and 2 210 in 2005
8518556 this is a big problem and countermeasures must be taken
8518557 countries like england ireland and sweden which are seeing population increases have a relatively open labor market while germany still makes it difficult for people to immigrate
8518558 a combination of economic differences and relative freedom of movement
8518559 its impossible to balance out the decline in births completely
8518560 if there be a discipline in which the americans are wanting
8518561 the addiction to the funny man who is a national misfortune there
8518562 all i care to know is that a man is a human being that is enough for me he cant be any worse
8518563 is at more of a high water mark than we are
8518564 one thing we never run into out there is a john mccain field organization
8518565 we think this is something that should be welcomed and celebrated the fact that were opening this up to average americans its been a great organizational tool we think about states colorado is a big battleground state and if it slips into the obama column from the mccain column his path just got a lot lot harder one of our best organizations now in the entire country will be in colorado as a result of this convention and the activities tomorrow night
8518566 to those who say she has a right to develop and grow
8518567 i think in the end it was the obvious bond and love that exists between ashley and her parents
8518568 that convinced them this was the right thing to do
8518569 benevolence and good intentions have been among the biggest enemies of disabled people over the course of history
8518570 many things that were done under a theory of benevolence were later seen as wrongheaded violations of human rights
8518571 medicines role is to relieve pain and improve function but ashley was not sick and the treatment was untested do we really want to start bending the rules in the case of the disabled just for the promise of some benefit in the future advocates ask thats not healing its gambling ashley may be an extreme case but she is a terrifying precedent critics note that for brain damaged children development can come very very slowly so deciding when shes only six to change a childs body irreversibly can amount to a medical form of identity theft frequent touch is indeed important but is it really so much harder to hug someone who is 56
8518572 but they refer to her as the pillow angel i know thats meant to be a sweet term but its terminally infantalizing
8518573 we hold as non negotiable the principle that personal and physical autonomy of all people with disabilities be regarded as sacrosanct
8518574 before moving forward wholesale we need to study it carefully
8518575 they dont have the money for a personal aide at home
8518576 the web of support for families who really want to care for their family member is uneven and sometimes tattered
8518577 if there were abundant support to help care for a fully grown son or daughter then people might not be pushed to a radical medical option like this
8518578 we have about 16 million saved up at the treasurers office weve recalculated the amounts based on the final judgment by the courts and weve already come out with the amounts senators not supporting camachos deficit elimination strategy
8518579 the financial state of the government of guam is bleak
8518580 when you have this situation in mid summer thats a big deal
8518581 all signs point to this being a major hurricane in the gulf of mexico
8518582 the focus is to get a good pre storm depiction of what lies ahead for gustav if it makes it into the gulf
8518583 if it hits the warm pool it will probably have the juice to intensify
8518584 and then when i got here i lost a tooth
8518585 everyone dropped what they were doing and on january 8 we started shooting it was an absolute charmed movie from day one we knew this was something special because we were all so fucking hungry
8518586 when i started i thought this whole thing was gonna be my i hate l a movie like fuck you it was originally called if l a fell into the ocean i wouldnt miss it
8518587 the board of directors is firmly committed to dan mudd
8518588 the board will continue to work closely with dan and his management team to guide the company and support the housing finance system through a very challenging period
8518589 this team will be responsible for meeting the dual objectives of conserving capital and controlling credit losses while fannie mae continues to provide crucial liquidity to the u s housing and mortgage markets
8518590 this was probably a necessary step but not one thats going to determine the future of fannie mae clearly the fate of fannie and freddie is in the hands of policymakers

8518594 one thing though before del monte canned tomatoes she used to use fresh tomatoes and peppers from her garden it was so good to this day if i get tomatoes in my garden i make my spaghetti sauce from scratch to go with the pork chops but to tell the truth although it tastes better with fresh tomatoes its just easier to use canned you dont have to deal with all those seeds
8518595 my grandmother inez estes taylor made this spaghetti recipe often she often served this with fried pork chops i never knew there was any other kind of spaghetti it was and still is one of my favorite dishes
8518596 cover and cook at medium temperature for about an hour to an hour and a half stirring occasionally and mashing tomatoes into smaller pieces as it cooks add water as necessary to make sure it doesnt burn and has the consistency of spaghetti sauce but not too watery

8518598 these failures were a cause of the accident which resulted in the death of daniel burman

8518601 it would be to my knowledge the largest penalty ever imposed by a court in this jurisdiction and a significant penalty in the country for offences of this type

8518603 cada pueblo piensa que su virgen es m s bonita milagrosa etc que la del pueblo de al lado
8518604 it grew out of a time when i think gen xers were feeling colossally invisible all the mass media oxygen seemed to be sucked up by baby boomers and millennials the baby boomers were turning 60 and thats all you heard about how the boomers were turning 60 and they were still sexy and theyre hot and theyre launching their second acts
8518605 and at the same time theres this media monotony this bombardment of lindsay paris britney
8518606 bloggy bling bling birdsong of me me me me me sounds

8518609 great you had a party in haight ashbury in 1967 im thrilled for you can we hear about the flappers in the 1920s instead how about the great depression theres other times in history that are interesting
8518610 they just love stuff they love celebrities they love technology they love brand names theyre happy to do whatever advertising tells them to do so what if they cant manage to read anything longer than an instant message
8518611 we didnt believe the same kind of things as boomers it was much harder to fool us
8518612 if the gen xers were like no im not in it for the money millennials rebelled against that and are completely greedy
8518613 we grew up with courses that dissect the media and advertising so i think were even more aware of whats going on
8518614 gen x stomping grounds of the past the espresso bar the record shop the thrift store have been resurrected in digital form the new bohemia is less a place than it is a headspace its flexible enough to bypass all the old binaries it encompasses mass and class mainstream and marginal yuppie and refusenik gearhead and luddite its everywhere and nowhere in particular
8518615 genxers are doing the quiet work of keeping america from sucking
8518616 weve created all these great websites that now millennials waste their lives on
8518617 if you grew up in the 50s and 60s you came of age at the same time that national culture first developed there were three major tv networks everyone was watching the same thing the assassination of j f k for instance was the first event the nation experienced in real time at the same time
8518618 are more along the lines of mortadella which is that really expensive and delicious baloney they make in italy

8518622 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8518623 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8518624 what i am opposed to is a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8518625 television has the greatest potential to inform and educate in the history of any medium
8518626 this is the first time im sounding a note of caution about the future i am afraid this time we see a kind of consumer strike now with people refusing to spend money
8518627 i havent met all that many people who base politics on reason alone even if they think they do theyre very often taking for granted a good many hidden moral and even spiritual assumptions reason alone is often identified with managing a variety of peoples self interests and that gets you so far it doesnt get you to the point where politics turns into something a little bit bigger than just the calculation of self interest when it understands something about obligation outside the immediate when politicians act for the sake of the poor elsewhere or for the sake of the environment generations on or whatever i dont think thats covered just by classical accounts of self interest and in that sense i dont think its just about reason theres something about vision and moral energy in there somewhere so im not sure id accept an absolute difference between revelation and reason in that connection
8518628 there was a subversion of the constitution on november 3 and that is what people are protesting against
8518629 we are committed to the supremacy of the constitution and this will continue until the actions of november 3 are reversed
8518630 well they ought to do this they ought to do that
8518631 the next six months are going to tell the story

8518633 on average in china the opening of 100 new restaurants means the simultaneous shut down of 120 old restaurants
8518634 all i know is that nixon was the first president of america to connect with china he was a great man
8518635 whatever happened to him was the fault of american politics it was a political thing
8518636 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8518637 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8518638 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8518639 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8518640 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8518641 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8518642 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8518643 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8518644 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8518645 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8518646 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8518647 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8518648 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8518649 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8518650 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8518651 when you change risk management people it has to be viewed as recognising problems so it is mildly positive
8518652 theres definitely a very good chance that all of them could stay
8518653 it will be an adjustment but it should be a good thing because the last couple of years i really got worn out toward the end of the season
8518654 it makes me more proud im sure if it was for some kind of independent brand that wasnt as iconic as calvin klein i dont think i would have done it because thats too much of a risk
8518655 not port 22 is a filter specification that tells tcpdump to filter out packets with ip source or destination port 22 as you know port 22 is ssh port basically when you tell tcpdump something like this it will make tcpdump ignore all ssh packets exactly what we needed

8518660 we have both marked patrol cars and unmarked vehicles out to keep an eye on restaurants and other commercial buildings
8518661 thats a response to takeovers occurring in the east bay and prompted by the one in castro valley
8518662 i will not make a complete fool of myself in the presence of such coolness
8518663 not sure if this is or is not the norm but i just received my brand new
8518664 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this
8518665 i think its a kind of personal touch its nice maybe every phone that gets a full quality test should have its testers picture taken and left on there and the working conditions look pretty good

8518667 thats what ive told adelaide director of football michael petrillo
8518668 hes a fantastic professional fantastic footballer and is extremely good within the group and a good natured person so for me hes got to stay i spoke to him even today
8518669 i also understand hes a footballer who wants to do the best for himself and his family
8518670 weve been in that situation before so any decision he makes is solely for himself and i understand that but in my opinion cassios a player here for the long term
8518671 agos fine he probably was ready last week but we were a bit precautionary with him

8518679 one of the big misconceptions about me is that i walk around in miniskirts and high heels 24 seven and go to the gym in heels
8518680 when people see me dressed normally they cant believe it its really weird
8518681 shes that side of me that was afraid of rejection that was afraid to take a chance and step up and have someone say no you dont get the role

8518697 it shows how highly regarded the column is that we have attracted someone of lauras calibre
8518698 with my deputy richard eden and chris lamb we faced a huge challenge making the seven day operation a success but make a success of it we have
8518699 lauras appointment demonstrates the telegraphs commitment to backing quality journalism and we are delighted we now have the team we want to consolidate our position as the premier diary in fleet street
8518700 we need journalists on mandrake who can write authoritatively on a wide range of subjects not just politics and bring in the genuinely big stories that the other papers have to follow up
8518701 jonathan is better suited to a specialist website and i am sure he will do well there
8518702 in the meantime we will still be broadcasting as xfm scotland but inevitably our focus will move towards the launch of the new station as the weeks go by
8518703 i know that there has been a lot of uncertainty and change over the past few months for everyone in glasgow and i really do appreciate the very professional way in which you have all carried on working so hard and your willingness to embrace change
8518704 central scotland can prepare itself to receive britains fastest growing radio station aimed at young people and the prospect of the output from the glasgow studios is an exciting one
8518705 there are a lot of discussions going on the thing is it is not an easy decision to make relocating abroad so any new job will have to be worth it
8518706 not about to leave and go and work in the us

8518717 here where the air is loaded with iodine and where the ultra violet ray is ever present in our smiling sunshine your health and happiness is our business
8518718 if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be
8518719 most company directors are blissfully unaware of the administrative or privileged passwords that their it guys have access to which allows them to see everything that is going on within the company these privileged identities which lie on hundreds of servers and applications very rarely get changed as its often considered too much hassle
8518720 our advice is secure the most privileged data and routinely change and manage them so that if an employees contract is terminated whether sacked or made redundant they cant maliciously play havoc inside the network or vindictively steal data for competitive or financial gain
8518721 and its been really nice meeting all the people they love to talk to us about gardening

8518801 miller took the people and scenery he encountered on his 1837 trip to the rocky mountains and created paintings with many layers of meaning out of seemingly simple western genre scenes giving them intangible qualities such as mood and emotion
8518802 in doing this he produced images that were more innovative and compelling than those of many of his peers working in the west or the east
8518803 the title of this exhibition though it may remind people of the popular song was carefully chosen
8518804 during millers lifetime sentimentalism was an important means of identifying inspiring or guiding moral action sentiments are feelings guided by thoughts this exhibition will demonstrate how miller was not only interested in depicting western subjects but also portraying them through the filter of his own nineteenth century sensibilities as an artist

8518912 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8518913 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche

8518928 these trees have stood here for generations and generations of our students and teachers have gathered at this beautiful space
8518929 these trees are as much a part of our heritage at wsu as the buildings and the classes that take place in them our campus architectural planners however have been destroying beautiful places like this one all over campus at an alarming rate this summer we have met with president elson floyd and he has assured us that future plans will involve serious efforts to preserve existing stands of trees
8518930 we are losing half of the avery grove this is happening to facilitate the parking of buses for the marching band and music camps it was a beautiful place and will now be an ugly concrete parking lot and newly planted trees wont grow in for 20 years
8518931 july 2 2008 there were two large trees that were removed between avery hall and brian hall over here
8518932 and then i asked what gives here they said this is part of a major plan that will re grade the entire front of the building and that was the first that any of us had heard of this you know we arent completely clueless we do pay attention to things but had never gleaned that from the plans that were presented to us there was a map that showed the trees that were going to be removed and we never saw it
8518933 we were able to save at least half of the trees including that beautiful red oak in the middle
8518934 living in eastern washington we dont have that many already
8518935 so i like a lot of trees in places i think when you are looking for shade or just add some scenery to it too we live in a big wheat field pretty much so having as many as we can on campus is a good idea i think
8518936 they could maybe try to figure out someway to work around it
8518937 i mean if the trees are like rotted then okay but if they are completely fine then there should be no reason to tear it down
8518938 just because youre hungarian kepes studied painting at the school of arts in budapest

8519006 the key message of our report is that the circumstances in which people are born grow live work and age are the fundamental drivers of health and health inequity
8519007 we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy
8519008 a more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity to make health and health equity a marker for government performance
8519009 health inequity really is a matter of life and death
8519010 unprecedented leadership is needed that compels all actors including those beyond the health sector to examine their impact on health

8519014 a comprehensive scientifically robust and transparent process has been undertaken in the assessment of the potential environmental impacts of this mine expansion and i have given these matters thorough consideration before making my decision

8519071 obviously there is some relief with the result we knew it would be a difficult game against a quick well organised team

8519073 i was delighted with dirk kuyt his goal was a reward for all the effort he puts in for us he is amazing
8519074 his work is tremendous he keeps going right to the end and makes a tremendous contribution to our side
8519075 we are very sad after that result over two matches we have been the best organised team and we deserved better than to lose like that in the final minutes
8519076 we have produced a high standard in both matches and now i hope that can be continued in our league matches and the uefa cup

8519128 the current comprehensive monitoring program will continue and heathgate resources will need to clearly demonstrate that they are having no impact on water quality within the great artesian basin or on aquifers outside the mining lease
8519129 although the market is showing some initial signs of firming premium rates it is not expected that substantial rate increases will occur across all business lines in the short term
8519130 in this environment and with some uncertainty over the extent of an economic slow down in australia it is expected that growth excluding acquisitions will again be fairly modest over the 2009 financial year
8519131 additional profit growth will depend on the successful completion of a number of smaller acquisitions that austbrokers is currently considering

8519157 its a good plan and its a big deal that a place like stanford has adopted it

8519161 when the true state of the company was revealed to the market its share price collapsed and 2 billion came off its market capitalisation

8519217 i fully expect that our sales growth in china will continue at a very high level for many years to come
8519218 the chinese industry over the next 20 years will be consolidated down to a few companies that compete worldwide
8519219 we will only acquire companies that want to be acquired so we are not out looking to make a hostile acquisition
8519220 when they start pointing into the dugout and doing and saying all the things that he was saying a guy that respects the game like myself i dont appreciate that and i had to let him know and i guess he did us a favor because he woke up a sleeping giant we came back and responded with four runs in the eighth inning they have a young ballclub theyre pretty good i respect the way they play the game and when you see a guy disrespecting the game obviously they pretty much beat us all year long you dont have to do a stupid thing like that to disrespect this game i let him know i didnt appreciate it he was still yelling and talking crap and running away i wanted him to stop and face me i respect this game and i didnt appreciate the way he disrespected us i didnt care if he yelled but when you start pointing into the dugout that s not professional right there
8519221 if i see anybody on our ballclub doing stupid stuff like that im going to pull them to the side and im going to get into their face you dont do that on this level
8519222 he did us a favor we came back and we pulled it the through and im glad he did that so i congratulate him for doing that to us
8519223 i told him to shut up and go to the dugout he doesnt have to do that thats when he said something in spanish that i dont want to say to you guys but thats when i got fired up i told him to stop and come and say that to my face but he was running away thats allright im going to see him later
8519224 yeah very much but i didnt care about the things he said to me it was more that he disrespected my team by pointing into the dugout he can curse me out and say whatever he wants i dont care but when he disrespects my teammates i need to stand up for my teammates i dont appreciate that
8519225 i dont care i dont care about villanueva getting excited its the same as hitting a ball out of the ballpark and showing off to the pitcher but when you start pointing and doing a bunch of crap and doing it to the other dugout i dont care if he would have pointed to their dugout and gotten fired up its a big series it was a big out he got with the bases loaded he could have done whatever he wanted by pointing to their dugout and getting fired up but he pointed to the wrong way to our dugout i didnt like that i had to stand up for my teammates
8519226 albert is the leader of this team and he stood up for his teammates it was nice to see
8519227 were not going to put out any more effort just because something like that happened thats not who we are or how we go about playing the game

8519254 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8519255 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8519256 it really showed a connection within the party and that no matter who is the nominee we are still a united party and we act as one base for the betterment of us all
8519257 i dont think president clinton looked all that excited when he talked about barack obama
8519258 he sounded like a thesis adviser writing a letter of recommendation for a student to get a job as a first year at some firm it was a little bit tepid but towards the end he deftly managed to recommend obama because of his own accomplishments i didnt think either of the clintons were full throated in their endorsements of obama they were kind of like mad lib endorsements you could have filled in anyones name
8519259 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure
8519260 you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it thats barack obama and thats what he will do for this country hell change it
8519261 no one is better than you you are everyones equal and everyone is equal to you
8519262 john mccain was wrong barack obama was right millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up our people are too good our debt to our parents and grandparents too great our obligation to our children is too sacred these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready im ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8519263 i think hes going to be a great vice president
8519264 he pounded away at linking mccain to some of the failed bush policies and tried to delineate obama and things hes done well from the past eight years
8519265 everybody is out there for one reason thats to try to get to october
8519266 i just tried to keep us in the game thats all i can do
8519267 he can reach back and get a couple extra miles an hour on it curveball and changeup is good as well it makes him really unhittable sometimes
8519268 cette initiative manque de toute base de r f rence

8519272 we will definitely discuss about tibetan refugees but as we have not yet made any policy i will not comment
8519273 china has given special attention to nepal due to the tibetan issue
8519274 if the new government constricts democratic space we will be forced to move to western countries where there is freedom to raise our voice for free tibet
8519275 my dream is complete hitting my first home run that was the best moment i thought it had a chance because that was the best pitch i had to hit he threw a good game and made two mistakes
8519276 hes doing a great job its funny we have the same numbers its great to be there now but you kind of look at where you are at the end of the season and gauge from that
8519277 he ended up throwing some pitches on that walk you have to do this a step at a time these guys get extended sometimes he will get an extra day so that will help
8519278 he gets on top of the ball hes like a whirling dervish out there hes got some deception hes got thump with the fastball hes got a sharp breaking ball hes got a slider and then he has that filthy changeup he was on tonight
8519279 this was a huge huge win for us simply because of the way we lost last night
8519280 we couldve afforded to lose but the way we lost last night you never know where thats going to lead you
8519281 you always want to see the big league team do well
8519282 it was a team effort its not about one guy or one pitcher we did a great job
8519283 were fighting some demons the demons of the past the rascals that have hung around us for a year
8519284 every time we lose a game like last night is a reminder of that
8519285 i think the race will come down to the end
8519286 what is web logging and why everyone is talking about it
8519287 in tyg crossdressing gays are not the subject of ridicule but are portrayed as intelligent strong individuals who have dreams aspirations and personal issues like anybody else this wonderful colorful side of gayness is rarely explored in films and i hope that after watching tyg the audience will be more understanding and more accepting of how diverse the world is
8519288 whats unique about the film is that it transcends gender preferences and sexuality gays will love tyg for its fabulous costumes and its empowering message women will love it for its wit straight men will learn from it
8519289 rich coast and costa rica is rich in beaches cultu
8519290 symbolically to the rest of the world what does it say
8519291 i see our broken health care system through her experience an experience shared by too many people and i believe with all my heart that we can and must achieve health care for all
8519292 i cant figure that out because were all in this together
8519293 what really breaks my back is to see him leave in a way that is disrespectful its disrespectful
8519294 its only been since early june 2 1 2 months and its hard when youre loyal to a candidate and you lose you just need some time
8519295 serve every day until it is determined he is no longer a possible threat
8519296 a lot of people in our community are on the edge at the tipping point
8519297 we have four bishops in the inner city who are so inundated so backed up these people cant get in to see them for three or four weeks
8519298 i remember listening to all the risks and how scared i was
8519299 thats when they came in and started talking to me about this study if i can help just one baby by doing this study it was more than worth it
8519300 one in every 500 babies are born with it in utah terms thats about two a week
8519301 it feels like my heart is falling out of my brain
8519302 a small but very important contribution towards the efforts being made by the government
8519303 the transition from 1 gigabit to 10 gigabit ethernet circuits is like going from a one lane road to a 10 lane freeway
8519304 weve enabled the network to put whatever they want to put on the network
8519305 our desire is to be a good neighbor and to provide alcohol in a convenient and responsible manner for those who choose to consume
8519306 its thematically and iconically important to be able to give recognition to different areas of the state everything from our national parks to skiing to the driving of the golden spike
8519307 going to a house and seeing a nice wreath on the door very welcoming
8519308 the old sign while it was very appropriate for the olympics doesnt necessarily relate to what were trying to do now which is to build ourselves up as a yearlong destination
8519309 scenery is what draws the majority of people along i 15 we need to speak to the majority of the people rather than a niche market and skiing is definitely that dont get me wrong i dont mind skiers for brian heads sake but scenery has broader appeal
8519310 several years ago toby keith shot a high concept video for his song beer for my horses
8519311 little kids should have their own time and we should have our own time
8519312 these are public facilities and we have to accommodate as many as we can
8519313 i would say about 95 percent of the older skaters show respect to the younger ones
8519314 they know that they were once younger and were learning to skate they give the young ones credit
8519315 we were at the south jordan one yesterday and my son wanted to ride in the bowl
8519316 they were like no were older and were better and he had to wait
8519317 there are big chunks like murray and west valley that dont have one
8519318 skaters come from every city and its not right for a kid to travel like 10 miles to a skate park
8519319 we had started on the design process a couple of years ago and for whatever reason it got stopped put on hold
8519320 we just dont have the money theyre fairly expensive to build the one we planned was about 500 000
8519321 we realize that we need to have good coverage throughout the city so well keep trying
8519322 the perception of the club really slipped in the last couple of years
8519323 this club has good guts but it needs a little break she needs to have some work done i need to do it because our consistent loyal base deserves it
8519324 there isnt a latino who hasnt stopped at the manhattan
8519325 our advantage is that this is a place for everyone saturday nights here its like one big family
8519326 were drama free we come just to have a good time
8519327 we are going to go to the standard that it used to be
8519328 we know that frank sinatra performed there twice and dean martin once
8519329 the state being involved in this case makes a lot of sense
8519330 i have grave concern that we continue to swim in a sea of illegal immigration
8519331 if we cannot control our borders we cannot control our destiny
8519332 dont be harassed or bullied or intimidated by the naysayers there is going to be an outcry from the business community
8519333 the u s chamber of commerce will sue utah just like they did oklahoma
8519334 but they want to handcuff them and send them back its b s
8519335 its a contemptible statement to say they take jobs americans just wont do
8519336 it appears poor contract standards and deficient oversight have become the accepted norm for doing business
8519337 do we need to change the statutes and tell counties how to operate their jails
8519338 we would have to step in and either run or buy that facility
8519339 jointly we can set minimum standards that could meet our expectations
8519340 right now each country is increasing its efforts to counter terrorism and bring domestic stability machimura told reporters
8519341 if japan leaves the battle lines it would go completely against the moves of the international community he said
8519342 the best way to carry out the wishes of mr ito and to show japans role as a peace fostering nation is to lend a helping hand to people in the region who are suffering from poverty and conflict prime minister yasuo fukuda said in a weekly email
8519343 ive already seen two or three kids cross the street running between the buses and motorists cant see them coming
8519344 other folks can have another agenda but that is not the citys agenda
8519345 i would not have bought it if i thought it was historic
8519346 its going to be a dirt lot within a very few feet of main street
8519347 we have folks who are landbanking and in the meantime we have these large parcels of ground where nothing is happening
8519348 i decided to share my depression with the world it really pisses a lot of people off
8519349 seems to deny services to undocumented adults even if served with federal funds
8519350 i feel confident the judge will rule in our favor
8519351 this is a conditional use permit theyre seeking whether you call it a pig horse or cow it is what it is
8519352 our suspicions that they were trying to skirt our initiative are confirmed and i dont think that will sit well with the people of sevier county
8519353 i love this place i was taken aback when we got in the restaurant cuz the neighborhood isnt the most attractive place

8519358 tracy and i had to cut our trip short we were only able to stay about ten or fifteen minutes we wanted to leave enough time for a soak before our massages at kabuki i could have used a lot more time

8519371 bravo did not put up a fight like what he promised in one of his interviews he ran away before our troops entered bilal complex
8519372 we have to show the milf hierarchy that we are serious in punishing their members who refused to give peace a chance
8519373 because weve already had a referendum on this issue i think the people will have to be consulted
8519374 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year where it will be discussed further with them so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well
8519375 were waiting for everyone else to tell us what to do
8519376 one of the most reliable sources of scathing rebuttal to the left wing media has become known for its humorous but biting style his regular verbal assault on labour ministers has quite a reputation
8519377 we like mr eugenides we highly recommend adding him to your blogroll go and read it is absolutely the most glorious stuff
8519378 oh boy i think reading you and devils kitchen is going to damage my psyche what a joy
8519379 the most amusing non stop critique of the labour government available
8519380 my favorite anglo rage boy the best apoplectic brit blogger
8519381 a widely acknowledged political genius of the first order still he finds time to visit greece sink a pint or two and take on the idiots who purport to govern our fair land
8519382 there really is no purpose to be served by following humbly in the wake of the genius of mr eugenides why seek to improve on perfection when one knows in advance that one will fail
8519383 i am impressed with the dexterity of mr e linguistic and otherwise
8519384 i rather enjoyed the retort of the blogger known as mr eugenides
8519385 for matt and myself itd be nice knowing what the situation would be and be able to move forward with it the way i look at it more than anything the sooner it can happen the sooner we can get past the interviews and media coverage that goes with it and you can prepare for the game
8519386 we know its getting close and you get that anxiety and excitement knowing the decision has to be made soon i am sure coach understands that and hell make the decision as soon as its necessary
8519387 hopefully well get in enough snaps with the first offensive line that both can play
8519388 i just wanted to make sure kurt gets his timing with the ones for this game much like we did in kansas city
8519389 oh god i dont want to leave phoenix and stephen

8519393 we dont know what causes it but worry and stress can be a factor
8519394 its a condition where your minds partially awake but you cant move
8519395 sufferers report anxiety and fear and often think theres an evil entity in the room with them
8519396 i wonder if the scary sleep paralysis had anything to do with my asthma
8519397 im so glad its not happening as much any more
8519398 before i won a grand slam the people thought of me ok as a big joker of the sport and a big potential and pretty good player but still i wasnt able to make that step forward and win a grand slam and just prove
8519399 i did this year i did prove i have enough quality to be potential grand slam winner on any surface i play so this is the most important thing to me
8519400 there is a lot of pressure involved and a lot of expectations but its all part of the sport and you just have to deal with it in the best possible way
8519401 i always want people to remember me of course as a tennis player as a great tennis player a champion whatever i dont want them to remember me as a clown
8519402 to come back to the place where did well and had a lot of success and a lot of memories

8519416 its an alarming thing for me i am quite alarmed by the resurgence of such kinds of groups it does not help solve the situation
8519417 i think the policy of having police auxiliaries is sufficient just to protect the communities but the ilaga with their connotation of having some quasi cultural significance in conflict is quite alarming
8519418 naturally that would be a consideration not primarily perhaps for the military but for the police
8519419 i dont know and even if i did i wouldnt be able to tell you for it security reasons

8519425 that lebanese hotel operator who was recruited from joneih two month ago doesnt know shit and going to buy you cheap chinese furniture

8519444 the uniformity intended by the legislature will not be achieved if school districts may continue using their diverse individual methods to determine students grade point averages to determine which students fall within the top ten or twenty five percent the school districts will have to rank the senior class by grade point averages computed according to the thecbs standard method for admissions
8519445 furthermore given the authority to implement the statue prospectively and the presumption against retroactively we conclude that the thecb is required to implement its standard method on a prospective basis only and has the latitude to provide for a transition period
8519446 ive seen war up close not as a political slogan or a think tank theory
8519447 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden onto hard pressed british families and businesses
8519448 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8519449 the government are talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8519450 excessive green taxes hit poorer people hardest hurt the competitiveness of british firms cause britain to export emissions and fall disproportionately on residents of rural and suburban areas
8519451 the taxpayers alliance figures are seriously flawed because they are based on a discredited approach to calculating the cost of climate change and in fact green taxes have fallen as a proportion of overall taxes since labour came to power
8519452 green taxes are one of the key policies needed to prevent dangerous climate change that would cost the uk billions of pounds and ruin lives
8519453 the government has fuelled public scepticism by failing to use tax breaks and public spending to make it cheaper and easier to go green if green taxes are to work the government must also invest in greener alternatives such as public transport
8519454 the estimate of green taxes is wrong as it includes taxes used to fund core public services rather than simply offsetting the cost of co2
8519455 in other election news an independent group supporting john mccain released an ad last week attacking sen barack obamas ties to former weather underground leader bill ayers

8519462 an outworn form to produce a contemporary novel which would provide excitement and mystery and yet say something true about contemporary men and women under the trauma of a police investigation
8519463 it all worked out for the best i have no regrets
8519464 i just want to work hard and set the example for the younger guys out here
8519465 folk and bluegrass but theyve made an effort to cross into country and blues
8519466 arranging music creatively is probably one of their favorite things to do
8519467 its a much more contemporary sound than the original bluegrass
8519468 well use the eagle alert system as a way of sharing information
8519469 as people realize the importance of early notification participation will go up
8519470 im going to sign up for information about the weather and anything about campus i need to know
8519471 it is still up in the air we have not made a final decision on where we are at
8519472 obviously we have to make a decision here pretty quick on who is going to go out there and take the first snap of the game you know somebodys got to do that
8519473 no its no big deal because both guys have been getting equal reps both guys the team feels very comfortable with its not like we change when one guy fills in or another guy fills in the team is comfortable with seeing either guy out there so its not like it will be something new for them
8519474 yeah there could be i dont anticipate that i would rather put one guy out there and lets see what he can do but if one guy excels in a certain situation then obviously we are going to put the best guy out there
8519475 i would love to be in the 80 85 area you will still see the transition on us it will still take a toll on us as well that will be something that you play your way into as much as we practice and as much as we try to simulate a game you just cant do it
8519476 we know now we have the ability to bounce back and not panic after falling behind early
8519477 overall we improved in the second half we came out with a little bit better will and determination and played better soccer than we did in the first half
8519478 obafemi is an outstanding player but there were a lot of people involved that helped her be in the position to score both those goals tonight this was a total team victory
8519479 early in the season who knows where were going to be as a team
8519480 we havent been on the field one time as a defense offense and special teams when you start breaking us down and look at how many guys have actually been in a football game its not a lot and its a scary deal
8519481 how are they going to react as many situations as we try to put them in to simulate a game you cant quite simulate the real thing
8519482 i have confidence in both of them if it comes down to it
8519483 weve got to do that pretty soon as far as who is going to start this game and just see what happens from there
8519484 the presidential decree makes official what has been an informal tradition in the making
8519485 wearing southern miss gold on fridays during the fall gets us excited and ready for all the enjoyment excitement and fellowship of a golden eagle football weekend
8519486 it should strike terror in the hearts of our opponents to see so many golden eagles soaring on game day
8519487 there are lots of ways in which the two partner and we are proud to finally have a ceremony to honor those in those fields
8519488 a very forward thinking visionary leader that has what is best for kids in his scope and that is the end goal for all educators
8519489 dr bounds is truly a courageous leader doing whatever necessary to improve student achievement in our state

8519495 this is a startling amount of change in a major area of peoples lives over a very short period
8519496 the committee serves the southern miss community by acting as a liaison between the student body and the student health service administration
8519497 this promotes an open channel of communication between the students and the health care providers so that shs can better meet the needs of southern miss students
8519498 it is important for them to participate in order to give accurate feedback
8519499 this group is very beneficial because its easier to talk to your peers rather than adults who sometimes dont understand what point you are trying to make in situations
8519500 most times when students are looking for volunteer hours it is harder to find things that fit between your school and work schedules if you have a job
8519501 but this organization seems to have the best of both

8519509 we cannot come to a meaningful solution on climate change without coming to grips with the question of deforestation
8519510 there is a real risk of africa becoming the forgotten continent in the context of the fight against climate change unless we manage to design a regime going into the future that takes into account in a much more comprehensive way what africas specific needs are not only on adaptation but also on fuelling clean economic growth

8519564 the substantial increase in exhibitors from other countries is the result of many years of work on international markets our success in increasing the international dimension of ifa is confirmation of our basic strategy
8519565 the successful ifa concept forms an excellent basis for long term success for the industry and for dealers we shall be providing visitors with a very broad high quality range of brand products in berlin ifa has established a reputation for introducing a whole range of new technologies and products moreover ifa provides a unique forum for announcing new developments in media policy
8519566 the number of exhibitors from other countries this year is among the largest of recent years consequently all the indications are that this will be a successful event
8519567 with orders totalling 2 75 billion euros 2007 ifa is the main european market place and one of the largest in the world for the ce sector this is a result of close cooperation between ifa and the trade and its organizations in 2008 the traditional partnerships with the international trade are being intensified again
8519568 throughout europe the first six months of 2008 were extremely successful for consumer electronics products much of this was due to traditional entertainment electronics products especially innovative flat screen tvs sporting events such as the european football championships and the olympics have helped to boost sales in view of the positive influences on the market so far for the second half of 2008 we expect growth to slow considerably as the annual highlight for the industry the worlds leading trade show for consumer electronics and the main venue for orders ifa is expected to provide a significant impetus to the industry and consequently a generally positive development in the consumer electronics market can be expected
8519569 europe is the worlds largest market for electrical domestic appliances which is why we need a strong trade show in germany ifa is one of the most important trade shows anywhere in the world which makes it the ideal platform for all the worlds leading brands
8519570 currently levels of economic performance in the home appliances sector are very varied there are downturns in important markets such as italy spain and the uk but by contrast growth in france and eastern europe for example in germany growth during the first six months of the year was close to three per cent and despite general consumer reticence we expect an overall annual increase of four per cent the rising demand for brand name appliances and for quality will sustain this growth political and social discussions about co2 emissions and climate protection are influencing consumer trends there is a wide gulf between the willingness to purchase environmentally friendly products and concrete action in this respect demand is failing to keep pace with supply and a combination of efforts and measures by the industry the trade politicians consumer organizations and the media is needed to overcome this discrepancy

8519572 blogging in germany and the us what german bloggers could learn from their us colleagues

8519602 from over 22 million new jobs down to 5 million from an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 1 2 million falling into poverty
8519603 barack obama knows that america cant be strong abroad unless we are first strong at home
8519604 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8519605 on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8519606 barack obama will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope
8519607 so if you like me believe that america must always be a place called hope then join hillary and chelsea and me in making barack obama the next president of the united states

8519741 i go with the critics and the peoples verdict which said the movie was not a good one i admit that maan gaye was a bad movie
8519742 im not that kind of a person who will go on telling anything good because im involved in it even if it is my performance in a film i dont have any reservation in telling the truth
8519743 i cant tell what went wrong with the movie or who is responsible for it but it is for sure the end result of the movie was not good
8519744 i play a very small role in the movie which is of not much importance even if you take my role out of the movie it will not have an impact on the film my character in the film is what a comedian does i provide the comic elements
8519745 though the story is very good but i request my audience not to expect anything from this film as my role is very small and i have nothing much to do
8519746 i play the lead role in before the rains which has already done a business of around 2 million dollars in the us canada and england
8519747 i love that song and i adore imran khan i think hes going to be a huge star he and ranbir are my current favourites in fact i told ranbir how much i like imran no he didnt mind at all ranbir and i are friends after bachna ae haseeno
8519748 some people you gel with others you just do your job with katrina is one of those cases we were just professionals on the sets but there was no rivalry or anything
8519749 we were both working for the same film not at cross purposes we were both liked in race though people would like to believe otherwise there was no negativity or animosity between us there was no dramatic tension on the sets were both too sensible for that there was just no scope for one to one interaction
8519750 id love to complete the film right now im going through a phase when im searching for roles ive no idea what i want but yes id like to do an author backed zany fun filled film at the same time i love multi starrers theyre more fun on the sets
8519751 lots of unfulfilled wishes before i give up acting if i dont like whats being offered i wont sign anything for now my last film is freeze with neil nitin mukesh
8519752 shes really sweet johns brother and anka were seeing each other for three years beyond that i wouldnt like to say anything about them let them lead their own lives

8519754 what youve heard is absolutely right this is unprecedented and overwhelming ive never gone through this experience before throughout my performance at the 02 arena the audience didnt sit at all all 20 000 of them stood on their feet while i performed
8519755 it was a deeply moving and humbling experience ive never been in a performance like this ever and perhaps the audience too had never felt like this before the entire venue was sold out we all got standing ovations the audience just freaked out
8519756 lets admit it the crowds came in such huge numbers mainly to see the big b we were the side attractions the way the audiences everywhere reacted to him had to be seen to be believed
8519757 the big b is such a rock star performing with him was an eye opener

8519763 its about dishonesty in man woman relationships i call it dishonesty by the standards set by civil society sometimes you are not satisfied in one relationship and keep looking for sexual and emotional satisfaction elsewhere i like playing this promiscuous character
8519764 in fact i pride myself for being quite fit but playing a gold medallist marathon runner isnt same thing ive to get into better shape and ive to look convincing as a long distance runner

8519786 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8519787 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8519788 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8519789 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8519790 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8519791 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8519792 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8519804 we spent a day kind of reflecting on what weve learned what progress we made and what refinements we need to make
8519805 one of the lessons weve learned in implementing the flagship agenda is we underestimated how important and how in need the physical facilities on campus are
8519806 the next one should be more defined to what we do well here at lsu
8519807 to accomplish whats been put forth on the flagship agenda we needed funding
8519808 the funding hasnt always been there and im glad that weve been funded over the last two years
8519809 we want high quality students high quality faculty and high quality programs
8519810 we have been very inventive in doing that across all of the dimensions of our academic mission
8519811 we will aggressively prosecute individuals and companies who line their own pockets by corrupting the bidding process for base procurement in afghanistan
8519812 these contracts were meant to protect u s soldiers serving their country and we will not tolerate corruption that deprives the troops of the benefits of competitively sourced goods and services
8519813 the community has gone up in percentage from 14 to 16 percent overall
8519814 to go up 2 percent in one year is incredible
8519815 there were about 200 more potential members to come through sorority recruitment this year
8519816 last year the quota was 60 and the year before that it was 65 so its a good bit more
8519817 i anticipate that we will have about 450 men join a fraternity this fall after the informal recruitment process ends
8519818 to me it always seems like there are more and more girls dressed alike on campus but maybe i just notice them more because they are wearing the same thing
8519819 not all organizations have informal recruitment in the spring so potential members want to give themselves more options in the fall
8519820 more women go through the recruitment process but in terms of the process we are doing better with the interfraternity council to market the product
8519821 it could be a matter of men not wanting that experience because there are a set of values you have to live by and that might not be as enticing to a freshman male as it is to a woman
8519822 the biggest similarity is that once initiated in an organization greek members are not allowed to join another national organization anywhere not even on another campus
8519823 greek women are becoming a lot more involved and loving being a member of their organization
8519824 theyve pulled this up and taken the copper that was under the ground
8519825 ive been doing it for about 40 years and its my hobby and you see a lot of kids that you feel it makes it worthwhile

8519827 due to the timeframe involved because it was shortly after she was released so timewise it does work out
8519828 we cant really say at this point that everything is related

8519841 when you talk about the dream you miss the violence of that day it was a very violent period
8519842 kennedy didnt want the march to take place d c was on a military lockdown that day
8519843 its never been done because the issues have been too big to surmount

8519905 at the same time i wasnt in a rush to get there i really appreciated the level i was at
8519906 i really want to go in with a clean slate with this team
8519907 no pre conceived opinions on the players i really want to give them the opportunity in camp to come out and prove themselves regardless of whats happened in the past here or how theyve played and performed

8519910 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8519911 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8519912 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8519913 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add
8519914 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8519915 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer

8519931 both our being and our essence always exceed the moment of our existence lying before us as gratuity and futurity mediated to us only in the splendid eros and terror of our in fieri because finite existence far from being the dialectical labor of an original contradiction is a pure gift grounded in no original substance wavering from nothinness into the openness of gods self outpouring infinity persisting in a condition of absolute fragility and fortuity impossible in itself and so actual beyond itself becoming is an ecstasy and nothing besides it is indeed a constant tension between what a thing is and what it is not between its past and its future between interior and exterior and so on but it is not originally a violent departure from the stability of an original essence our being is simply the rapture of arrival creaturely becoming in its original and ultimate truth departs from no ground but simply hastens to an end
