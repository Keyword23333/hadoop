2500000 i rode once before when i was about as tall as my boot and i took about a one hour class before i came out here now i can gallop and ride bareback a little
2500001 it is pretty interesting you learn a lot in the course of four days when youve never ridden before both from experience and the wranglers
2500002 ive learned how to actually ride the horse care for the horse and actually how to safely fall off the horse if you are going to fall off
2500003 my horse has a problem with a few other horses and if they get too close behind her she will kick them with her back feet
2500004 im a little bit nervous i think well do it even if we have a few mishaps maybe varun will get thrown again i dont think his horse likes him too much
2500005 i think we are cheating a little bit with all the modern technology but i think driving cattle today will put us back into their time
2500006 we are going to learn to drive cattle and that should be interesting
2500007 i was expecting a really good trip riding a horse is a once in a lifetime opportunity and if someone does get to ride a horse it is usually in an arena or something
2500008 this is a once in a lifetime trip i would go on this trip again i think any of us would go on this trip again the food has been really good too
2500009 sites like rivals com were revolutionary because they brought their readers extremely closer to the college game than anyone had ever been before and its all in one easy reliable place the information just wasnt there before and they took advantage but now the information is as accessible as ever its why everybody knows that matt barkley is a 5 star recruit and that 1 recruit in the country usc blitz revolutionizes the way through which my users can interact with the world of college football
2500010 my site revolves around the idea of interaction with information as opposed to the consumption of information thats the way i see the internet sports world going
2500011 its exciting one day is never the same as the next i love what ive created here because its pure and i feel like this is just the beginning it was created out of my passion for the usc trojans and their football team now its turned into my way of playing for them so i like to give it all i got
2500012 i actually really liked it it was a good combination of sweet and salty
2500013 chefs are trying to be more playful and incorporate new kinds of whimsy
2500014 we brought it down to the boardwalk and put it in a case just to see if people would react and they reacted
2500015 i didnt think it would be very good but once i tried it it was good
2500016 years ago i think food tended to be more traditional and less fun
2500017 its the melding of both these worlds the high end and the low end
2500018 i actually really liked it it was a good combination of sweet and salty
2500019 chefs are trying to be more playful and incorporate new kinds of whimsy
2500020 we brought it down to the boardwalk and put it in a case just to see if people would react and they reacted
2500021 i didnt think it would be very good but once i tried it it was good
2500022 years ago i think food tended to be more traditional and less fun
2500023 its the melding of both these worlds the high end and the low end
2500024 its a theatre thats been known about for a long time but no remains have ever been found
2500025 i accept that when you were drunk and confronted by the police you did produce the knife you were carrying
2500026 you backed away from the officer and threw the knife down it is plain that you were depressed and abusing alcohol to cope with that depression but since then you have taken steps to deal with your problems
2500027 they have been successful and it would be unjust to send you to prison today
2500028 well theres an end to everything good god im 96 years old i ought to die and i dont do it i dont know whats wrong with me
2500029 it gives you that peace of mind and that happiness that confidence that the team has confidence in you
2500030 this is a premier guy leader player he just wants to win so badly
2500031 if you take somebody with that kind of talent and those kind of intangibles that they bring to your team in who they are in their heart in their head
2500032 that is the guy you want to make sure is feeling good about things if you possibly can
2500033 this is the most complicated contract that ive ever seen not just that ive ever done
2500034 this was 52 pages of addendums not even counting the pages in the contract
2500035 older people represent a larger proportion of the hospital inpatient case load
2500036 they have more complications and have to have more done for them so that makes the job of the nurses and people taking care of hospital patients much harder than it was 30 or 40 years ago
2500037 it brought tears to my eyes because bernie mac has always been my all time favorite entertainer and comedian it pains me to have to report that
2500038 he even had dancers called macaronis that was my first exposure to how talented bernie mac was and after that show thats when hollywood started beating down his door

2500046 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2500047 we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august 6th
2500048 russia needs to support these efforts so that peace can be restored as quickly as possible
2500049 to urgently convene a meeting of the european council at the level of heads of government
2500050 russian military forces have gone through all the red lines by crossing an internationally recognised border into the sovereign territory of georgia
2500051 this is a clear act with visible elements of aggression and an outrageous violation of international law with grave consequences to regional and euro atlantic stability and security as well as to euro atlantic relations with russia
2500052 iran is ready to offer any help under its principal policies of contributing to the establishment of peace and stability in the region
2500053 a worsening of the crisis could affect the whole region with its negative consequences
2500054 we hope that wisdom the desire for peace and negotiation can prevail over the use of force

2500059 precipitous decline in the performance of the company and the conscious destruction of its entrepreneurial culture
2500060 when i retired as chairman allianz was a flourishing vibrant and profitable company with a unique culture that challenged motivated recognized and rewarded employees who worked to make themselves and the company better now
2500061 allianz life is a mere shadow of its former self and may be wounded beyond repair
2500062 a full blown bureaucratic management system has been substituted for an entrepreneurial culture bureaucratic managers have infiltrated the company bringing with them the calcifying taint of the bureaucratic culture
2500063 was that we like many companies are being impacted by the economic slowdown and an acute downturn in financial services
2500064 the problems with allianz life cannot be passed off to others
2500065 but must come to roost at the feet of an ineffective destructive bureaucratic management group and in this regard allianz life unfortunately serves as a wonderful case study for comparing the differences between a bureaucratic and entrepreneurial culture

2500100 i was not interested in making a record about the d word i got all that stuff out of my system on the last record 2005s pensive songs for silverman which was deliberately stoic this new album is really about me being free which is why it feels cathartic and expressive its about me coming back to being myself
2500101 i came out of the courthouse kissed the ground and walked straight into the studio i felt like a bottle of champagne that had been shaken for 18 months and popped open in the studio thats why this record has so much energy
2500102 it seems like the time has come to release the collection this year

2500113 zapatero ha desautorizado en toda regla a solbes como vicepresidente econ mico porque los presidentes de gobierno no presiden reuniones de asuntos delegados presiden gabinetes de crisis
2500114 desde el partido popular creemos que se va a reunir un gabinete de crisis que puede que est justificado porque la situaci n es grave y le pedimos a zapatero que reconozca que tiene que reunir un gabinete de crisis nos parece bien que zapatero trabaje dos d as en agosto pero nos gustar a que trabajase alguno m s
2500115 ser a interpretado siempre como una desautorizaci n del presidente de la comisi n que se ha tenido que levantar para dejarle la silla a presidente del congreso
2500116 si zapatero presidiera la reuni n de subsecretarios previa al consejo de ministros estar a desautorizando al propio consejo de ministros por tanto solbes se queda en este momento en una situaci n m s que comprometida porque el presidente del gobierno asume las funciones del ministro de econom a
2500117 una parte del psoe est dispuesta a echarle un pulso a zapatero y al psoe nacional para obtener beneficios para su propia comunidad
2500118 zapatero no es de fiar los partidos catalanes se cre an que hab an recibido un cheque en blanco con el estatut pero se han dado cuenta que es un cheque sin fondos no hab a nada en el banco
2500119 el partido popular ya se al que el estatut no era el lugar adecuado para regular la financiaci n de las comunidades aut nomas y ahora se demuestra que ten amos raz n porque el estatut no era el lugar para conseguir el dinero y que tal y como se fij era un modelo inviable
2500120 si en el estatut se fijaba un modelo de financiaci n con poca flexibilidad esa poca flexibilidad conlleva el incumplimiento por parte del gobierno central del acuerdo debido al momento de crisis en el que nos encontramos
2500121 catalu a como el resto de comunidades aut nomas necesita una nueva financiaci n y esta debe de realizarse fuera del estatuto de autonom a la financiaci n debe alcanzarse a trav s de un acuerdo com n de todos los partidos y una negociaci n multilateral de todas las comunidades
2500122 catalu a necesita financiaci n cuenta con un mill n m s de habitantes al que se les presta sanidad educaci n servicios sociales dependencia y a ese mill n m s de ciudadanos hay que financiarlos si no se incumplir a el compromiso que todos tenemos de que incluso en tiempos de crisis hay que atender las partidas sociales las comunidades aut nomas catalu a entre ellas necesitan un nuevo modelo de financiaci n
2500123 todos tienen que hablar con todos que negociar para obtener un nuevo modelo de financiaci n pero nadie se debe quedar con la sensaci n de que hay una comunidad aut noma que en una mesa camilla antes de negociar en la mesa ya se ha llevado la parte que le correspond a y algo m s
2500124 los presupuestos generales del estado de este a o son unas cifras expansivas que no preve an que fuera a haber una crisis econ mica prorrogar los presupuestos de 2008 al pr ximo ser a salvaje porque ser a aplicar a un a o de profunda crisis econ mica un presupuesto de una poca de optimismo en la que se pensaba que la crisis nunca iba a llegar
2500125 la pr rroga depender de los apoyos que pueda conseguir el psoe dentro de su propio partido nos parece grav simo y suicida que una parte del psoe el psc anuncie hoy que puede no votar los pge si no se resuelve la financiaci n de catalu a
2500126 esto significa que una parte del psoe est dispuesta a echarle un pulso a zapatero y al psoe nacional para obtener beneficios para su propia comunidad que en una poca de sequ a econ mica de dificultad est dispuesta a detraer la caja com n y todo lo que sea necesario para satisfacer sus propios compromisos sin tener en cuenta que el presupuesto de todos es m s importante que el particular
2500127 se pone de manifiesto que el psoe se puede estar rompiendo cuando en un partido pol tico una de sus comunidades aut nomas le echa un pulso al resto chantajea al secretario general amenaz ndole con no votar los presupuestos si no le da satisfacci n a la financiaci n auton mica algo muy grave ocurre en el partido
2500128 es in dito que en el psoe o pp un grupo auton mico amenace con no votar los presupuestos y probablemente dentro de poco amenazar n con marcharse del grupo socialista en el congreso de los diputados

2500131 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2500132 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2500133 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2500134 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2500135 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2500136 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2500137 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2500138 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2500139 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2500140 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2500141 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2500142 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2500143 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2500144 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2500145 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2500146 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2500147 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2500148 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2500149 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2500150 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2500151 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2500152 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

2500154 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2500155 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2500156 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2500157 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2500158 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2500159 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2500160 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2500161 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2500162 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2500163 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2500164 yes some people do use it but i doubt too many people call it by its current acronym
2500165 many a small thing has been made large by the right kind of advertising
2500166 you just want to do that because you want to wear a uniform
2500167 demon haunted world science as a candle in the dark
2500168 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2500169 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2500170 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2500171 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2500172 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2500173 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2500174 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2500175 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2500176 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2500177 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2500178 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2500179 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2500180 we are looking at some options at the moment three or four different options about the striker department which we hope will come to a happy conclusion
2500181 of course everybody wants to play at the highest level
2500182 i want to play also at the highest level but at this time i am in ajax so i will see what is happening
2500183 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2500184 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2500185 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2500186 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2500187 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2500188 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2500189 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2500190 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2500191 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2500192 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2500193 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2500194 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2500195 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2500196 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2500197 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2500198 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2500199 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

2500439 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

2500560 hatfill commissioned william patrick iii a biological weapons expert to write a report on how to deal with anthrax sent through the mail
2500561 the concept of a report on anthrax mail attacks two years before last octobers mailings intrigued the fbi in particular patricks report discussed mailing 2 5 grams of anthrax powder about the same amount contained in the deadly anthrax letters
2500562 it was just shock and complete disbelief that this was happening
2500563 before the sept 11 attacks ivins had worked on and held a share of two anthrax vaccine patents at least one of which was licensed to

2500575 the russian offensive against and in georgia is an act of aggression that is incompatible with international law and fundamental principles of security and cooperation in europe
2500576 we and russia will have to live with the consequences of russias use of force for a long time to come
2500577 the justification given by russia is that it is protecting russian nationals but the obligation to protect people irrespective of their nationality lies with the state in which those individuals are located
2500578 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and that is why it is so important that this doctrine is emphatically dismissed the same doctrine can be equally dangerous in other situations
2500579 we did not accept military intervention by milosevics serbia in other former yugoslav states on the grounds of protecting serbian passport holders

2500601 russian military forces have gone through all the red lines by crossing an internationally recognised border into the sovereign territory of georgia
2500602 this is a clear act with visible elements of aggression and an outrageous violation of international law with grave consequences to regional and euro atlantic stability and security as well as to euro atlantic relations with russia
2500603 iran is ready to offer any help under its principal policies of contributing to the establishment of peace and stability in the region
2500604 a worsening of the crisis could affect the whole region with its negative consequences

2500616 there are at least 200 million people in china who still earn less than us1 a day and you the government are splurging all that money and mobilising everyone to hold a fancy olympics
2500617 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2500618 the future world order is to be decided today in georgia
2500619 im simply staggered by the amount of money being spent by public bodies sending their staff to the games for questionable reasons and benefits add to your site
2500620 hes just vanished into thin air i mean where is he the chances of us finding him out in public now are quite minimal
2500621 we think he would have surfaced by now being hungry cold and tired
2500622 so were now looking for evidence of anything were not counting anything out all we know is he left the house to come to the park his mum didnt see him reach glenferrie road because he was too quick for her
2500623 theres no evidence to suggest hes been abducted but were not counting anything out all we know is no one saw him get here to the park
2500624 i could have brought this in tomorrow but ive given you a months notice
2500625 there was no sense of care for our businesses she was talking down to us the whole time basically everyone felt as if we were being spoken to as children that was the tone of it
2500626 eso da la pauta del paso del tiempo y as puede calcularse el a o de cosecha pero distintos vinos tienen distintas tasas de oxidaci n el tinto se aclara con los a os comienza con los azules y violacios y va pasando hacia el rojo rub y de ah hacia el marr n
2500627 puede tener un tono viol ceo y ser casi transparente o parecer tinta china esto dar una idea de la estructura que va a tener ese vino un vino con mucha profundidad va a ser un vino con mucha estructura tiene que ver con la cantidad de extracto seco del vino que es todo lo que le queda al vino si se lo reduce y se evapora alcohol y agua
2500628 as un malbec tiene m s tonos violaceos que un cabernet y un cabernet tiene m s profundidad de color que un pinot noir y tiene una piel delgada y que no coloriza tanto los vinos
2500629 porque se pone al vino en contacto con madera generalmente roble americano o franc s sometido a un proceso de tostado que va a dar diferentes notas u aromas son todos subproductos del contacto del vino y la madera
2500630 son aromas m s terrosos de cuero de hongos de una cantidad de otras cosas que se generan cuando un vino se guarda determinado tiempo cuando se dicen qu bouquet y es un vino 2006 es un error porque un 2006 no puede tener bouquet m nimo debe tener 3 4 a os en botella y uno desde la elaboraci n
2500631 vivimos en la era de la imagen lo visual tiene una importancia enorme y la gente est m s acostumbrada a guiarse por lo que ve aunque nos basta con cantidades nfimas de una sustancia para percibirla a nivel gustativo necesitamos que nuestra nariz funcione mejor que el gusto si est mal un producto se lo detecta a nivel olfativo primero
2500632 el alcohol se percibe en esta etapa a nivel olfativo el gustativo y el del tacto el alcohol como los picantes afecta a los nervios trigeminales los taninos inhiben la producci n de saliva de ah que secan la boca entonces cuando uno prueba tiene que lidiar con tres percepciones diferentes sabor que es gusto aroma y tacto percibido en la boca
2500633 while guns germs and steel offers many interesting and plausible suggestions as to how geography may have influenced human history his apparent ignorance of the discipline of history leads him to propose replacing true historical inquiry with a scientific hunt for the ultimate causes of historical events diamonds central conception is that the course of history broadly speaking is not determined by individual actions cultural factors or racial differences but by the environmental circumstances into which different groups of people accidentally wandered
2500634 many submissions put forward the view that vsu has resulted in a lessening of vibrancy diversity and to some extent the attractiveness of university life
2500635 our plan is to run the television ad on every other major station in the country but seven
2500636 being able to hear whats happening outside the vehicle is very important
2500637 without that youre not putting yourself in a strong position to respond more safely
2500638 we strongly suspect that wearing earphones will present a safety challenge to drivers in particular situations but there needs to be that evidence in place before legislative initiatives are considered
2500639 that tends to immediately cut you off from the acoustic world around you
2500640 territorians have spoken tonight i will listen to their concerns
2500641 if i held the balance of power i would have to give serious consideration to what i would do
2500642 we listened to what people have said we know they are concerned and we have responded to those concerns with a comprehensive plan
2500643 needs to do some kind of hard looking at the timing of this election
2500644 we consulted with our customers and this is a bet type which they were keen to see offered we are currently in consultation with the victorian and nsw commissions for gambling regulation but we hope the bet will be available for the spring carnival
2500645 this bet will be quite different to anything offered by tabcorp at the moment and it signals their intent to try and attract new clients because its going to be very difficult to pick the six winners there wont be many winning tickets and because there wont be many winners the prizes could be huge life changing sums
2500646 what started as a hobby ended up as a business when dad was encouraged by a lot of friends to set it up
2500647 wed get carcasses from the abattoir or fatten pigs on the farm and it was all done at home slaughtered from start to finish all done here
2500648 its very simple but i enjoy the meat for itself
2500649 we are more sure now than ever before that eating processed meat increases your risk of bowel cancer
2500650 the evidence is that whether you are talking about bacon ham or pastrami the safest amount to eat is none at all
2500651 i would never know were they more interested in the name than the picture
2500652 this year we havent experienced the kind of labour shortages weve had in the past
2500653 does australia want unskilled labour coming in from a number of pacific islands given there are half a million unemployed people in our country already
2500654 while at the drum tower in central beijing the two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant
2500655 one of the family members was killed and the other seriously injured following the attack the assailant took his own life
2500656 killed himself by jumping from the second storey of the drum tower
2500657 were not after cheap labour what we want is an honest days work for an honest days pay
2500658 weve been struggling for years to get the people we need and its only going to get worse
2500659 were not after cheap labour what we want is an honest days work for an honest days pay this argument that farmers just want cheap labour makes me very very angry
2500660 cyclists cannot see the cars until they are a few seconds away
2500661 if a car is coming its going to be catastrophic
2500662 its hard to believe they would design a bit of new bike infrastructure this poorly
2500663 it was really nice to have our prime minister there and it certainly was a big thrill for the girls a wonderful thrill for the girls to meet the prime minister and his wife so we feel really honoured
2500664 we were so happy that he came out and supported us today being a 9am game
2500665 if you have a right product attracting the best of talent is not very difficult
2500666 and if the film in question is the adaptation of henrik ibsens the master builder and directed by award winning director k p kumaran its a cake walk
2500667 its a common practice in indian film industry to involve a
2500668 no reason at the present time to link the death to the camp for climate action protest
2500669 the mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one
2500670 nothing could be more irrelevant than to contemplate your significance what makes you important is that you are you
2500671 panasonic viera hdtv el futbol llega al alma pero entra por los ojos
2500672 and of course blanco davino and angel are major stars in the hispanic community
2500673 i wasnt expecting heats to be that fast after seeing the first two heats i wanted to be top seed going into tomorrow
2500674 its going to be a race between three or four of us im looking forward to it
2500675 it was alright i got it out of the way it was a good race my best prelim swim im happy with that
2500676 it the final is going to be tough but im going to give michael a run for his money
2500677 i think if someone wants to win they have to go under 4 05
2500678 ill try to beat michael i will try to go with no pressure ill give it everything
2500679 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowless features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair color
2500680 the little man is healthy happy and as loud as his daddy
2500681 its been a huge honor to get back with my good friends
2500682 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other that doesnt mean it hadnt crossed my mind
2500683 apa boleh buat tahi kambing bulat bulat tembelang sudah pecah
2500684 he was absolutely marvellous so prepared so professional so enthusiastic
2500685 i didnt know jean lemire but the fact that it was a canadian piece swung me over to it
2500686 i looked at it and i really loved their work
2500687 they went through trauma and personal anguish and terrible terrible disappointment with what is happening with the world
2500688 oh i hope they get a devastating understanding of what terrible things that we are doing
2500689 just look at the wretched broadcasting in the united states during this presidential campaign its disgusting look what theyre feeding people
2500690 if barack obama is elected president then al gore will be the energy czar in the united states and that i do believe would have a very positive effect
2500691 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2500692 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties
2500693 the community didnt see it coming i didnt see it coming
2500694 northern territory chief minister paul henderson had the darwin cup on last weekend and the olympics on this weekend and another public holiday in the middle
2500695 people apparently didnt like it it has rebounded on him
2500696 a third term was always going to be hard for labor to win
2500697 all through this i was quietly confident that we were on the right track
2500698 i think the sustainability of paul hendersons leadership is really in question
2500699 psy 4 de la rime les cit s dor clip paroles
2500700 the community didnt see it coming i didnt see it coming
2500701 a third term was always going to be hard for labor to win
2500702 all through this i was quietly confident that we were on the right track
2500703 i think the sustainability of paul hendersons leadership is really in question
2500704 ich such mir einen neuen lover f r dich alles gute luxusburgchen
2500705 if u k is worried weve far greater reason to be worried
2500706 if the u k is worried we have far greater reason to be worried
2500707 the implications for india could be catastrophic even if the temperature were to rise by as much as two degrees celsius because our adaptive capacity is so low
2500708 unlike a developed country such as the u k which can mobilise adaptation strategies like building barriers against sea level rise india does not have the financial technological or institutional capacity to cope even with existing natural disasters let alone climate change which would trigger an increase in extreme weather events like droughts and floods
2500709 even though vast resources were made available for tsunami relief and rehabilitation not even one third of those who lost their homes have been rehabilitated and only a fraction of houses built for the victims have been occupied because they were either found to be architecturally inappropriate or sociologically incompatible
2500710 communities who depend on climate sensitive sectors such as dryland farming fisheries and forest resources will be worst affected
2500711 for instance parts of orissa and andhra pradesh could begin to see temperatures going up to 50 degrees and cities like bangalore will begin to experience temperatures of 40 degrees by the end of the century
2500712 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2500713 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2500714 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2500715 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2500716 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2500717 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2500718 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2500719 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2500720 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2500721 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2500722 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2500723 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2500724 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2500725 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2500726 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2500727 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2500728 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2500729 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2500730 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2500731 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2500732 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2500733 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2500734 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2500735 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2500736 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2500737 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2500738 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2500739 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2500740 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2500741 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2500742 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2500743 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2500744 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2500745 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2500746 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2500747 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2500748 just so you all know we did set a record
2500749 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2500750 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2500751 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2500752 if you are an international organisation dependent on international visitors and guests eliminating your carbon footprint is going to be impossible its about tidying up the edges and not being profligate rather than eliminating it its about doing our best
2500753 the things that will have effect are the price of oil and whether people can come at all
2500754 where a flight is essential people should offset it and be very careful to buy offsets that are genuinely beneficial
2500755 in every life there is one particular event that is decisive for the entire person for his fate his convictions his passions
2500756 where had all that russian generosity gone it had been replaced by political consciousness
2500757 for not having seen it all nor remembered it all for not having divined all of it
2500758 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
2500759 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
2500760 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
2500761 but john mccain is four more years of george w bush
2500762 the danger from iran is grave it is real and my goal will be to eliminate this threat
2500763 let there be no doubt i will always keep the threat of military action on the table to defend our security and our ally israel sometimes there are no alternatives to confrontation
2500764 michael moore is a supporter of yours and has endorsed you but in his new book mikes election guide he says the following go ahead and fill in the blank ive provided a full list of outrageously offensive lines already taken out of context in advance to make it easy for rightwing commentators and fox news will you still accept his endorsement or do you denounce him
2500765 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2500766 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2500767 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2500768 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2500769 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2500770 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2500771 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2500772 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
2500773 this is an enormous waste of law enforcement resources that should be focused on violent and serious crime
2500774 with alcohol we acknowledge the distinction between use and abuse and we focus our law enforcement on efforts to stop irresponsible use we do not arrest or jail responsible drinkers that should be our policy for marijuana as well
2500775 an addictive drug which induces in its users insanity criminality and death
2500776 the perception that marijuana is about fun and freedom it isnt its about dependency disease and dysfunction
2500777 not soon but eventually youll see the development of a marijuana futures market
2500778 150 calls and leads a day can you do that
2500779 real results by the end of my first term in office
2500780 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2500781 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2500782 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
2500783 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
2500784 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
2500785 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2500786 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2500787 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2500788 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2500789 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2500790 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2500791 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2500792 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
2500793 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2500794 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2500795 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2500796 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2500797 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2500798 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2500799 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2500800 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2500801 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2500802 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2500803 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2500804 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2500805 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2500806 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2500807 many of those offshore leases are deepwater potentially lucrative but expensive the shallower the lease the less costly the exploration there is another factor at work as well part of an oil companys worth is the reserves of oil it owns or leases so amassing lots of leases boosts its stock value it is always good to lease more
2500808 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2500809 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2500810 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2500811 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2500812 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2500813 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2500814 remember that natural gas pipeline the oil companies magically never seem to build to the north slope
2500815 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
2500816 saying that production wouldnt begin for 10 years democrats oppose offshore drilling just like they did 10 years ago
2500817 why the democrats cant make the oil companies the bad guys on this issue is beyond me
2500818 its a delicate balance and that balance is being skewed by the 24 7 world of internet and cable news faster faster is the mantra but we need to try our damndest to fact check on demand
2500819 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2500820 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2500821 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2500822 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2500823 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2500824 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2500825 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2500826 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2500827 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2500828 it predates me being involved in politics or him being involved in politics im older than him so i serve an older brother role i hope he feels ive been there for him and hes certainly been a very loyal and terrifically helpful colleague
2500829 one of the roles ive always wound up playing is being a translator telling people yes he has a different approach hes serious about change this is what it means and my relationship with him gives credibility to that
2500830 my dad is one of the people who taught me how to laugh
2500831 i ended up delivering packages to these glittering buildings in downtown chicago and when youre a kid growing up in chicago these are the most important buildings in your life
2500832 in a permanent state of zen very even handed very mild mannered
2500833 mi pare bine c am ajuns la koln sper s repet sezonul pe care l am avut la cottbus
2500834 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2500835 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2500836 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2500837 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive

2500839 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2500840 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2500841 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2500842 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm

2500888 global warming has finally been explained the earth is getting hotter because the sun is burning more brightly than at any time during the past 1 000 years according to new research
2500889 suggests that increasing radiation from the sun is responsible for recent global climate changes
2500890 is brighter than it was a few hundred years ago and this brightening started relatively recently in the last 100 to 150 years
2500891 simultaneous warming on earth and mars suggests that our planets recent climate changes have a natural and not a human induced cause
2500892 habibullo abdussamatov head of space research at st petersburgs pulkovo astronomical observatory in russia says the mars data is evidence that the current global warming on earth is being caused by changes in the sun
2500893 changes in the suns heat output can account for almost all the climate changes we see on both planets
2500894 similar to the warming experienced on earth over approximately the same period
2500895 suggests rapid changes in planetary climates could be natural phenomena
2500896 some planetary climate changes may be due to variations in the solar system environment

2500904 the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossil fuels and requires immediate action
2500905 1 500 clergy theologians religious leaders scientists academics and policy experts concerned about the harm that
2500906 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate moreover there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the earth
2500907 when politicians and journalists declare that the science of global warming is settled they show a regrettable ignorance about how science works
2500908 climate research became politicized in favour of one particular hypothesis

2500922 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that

2500946 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2500947 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2500948 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants

2500957 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2500958 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
2500959 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
2500960 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads

2500964 the tendencies of newspapers and news channels to give unverified accounts is a development that raises a lot of concern
2500965 we have made our position clear that we will not have any ties with the parties which had relationship with the congress and the bjp it is for them to take a decision
2500966 we cannot fight terror with laws like these we will form a law stricter than pota when we come to power
2500967 the upa governments actions and its intentions are a matter of suspect for the whole country
2500968 there were some terrorist attacks also while nda was in power but in those incidents the security forces were able to shoot down the terrorists due to high moral today even the forces are demoralised by the government
2500969 let me caution the government to avoid using army against the agitating civilians
2500970 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2500971 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2500972 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2500973 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2500974 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2500975 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2500976 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2500977 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2500978 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2500979 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

2500983 if we had a strengthening of the dollar that would help
2500984 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2500985 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2500986 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2500987 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2500988 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away

2500991 in 2006 two years ago i made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else in 2006 i told elizabeth about the mistake asked her for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness and we have kept this within our family since that time
2500992 all of my family knows about this and just to be absolutely clear none of them are responsible for it i am responsible for it i alone am responsible for it

2501011 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2501012 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2501013 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2501014 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2501015 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2501016 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2501017 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2501018 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world

2501020 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
2501021 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid

2501040 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2501041 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2501042 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

2501060 it was definitely on my mind a little bit it cant not be

2501063 i dont swim well when im the center of attention
2501064 its always great to get the first race over and done with
2501065 but a few things went wrong there and still going in fastest qualifier for the semifinal its great to know that i have something to improve on

2501069 se siente pr cticamente el abanderado y sabe que esta es la ltima chance que tiene de ganar oro en una olimpiada
2501070 a rom n eso le gusta y lo ha demostrado en boca

2501079 this lady rosa parks sat down so we could stand up
2501080 she set an example for the rest of us in the civil rights struggle a strong will to face whatever we had to face
2501081 they probably could have gotten out themselves but we took precautions and had them extricated to prevent more injuries
2501082 we have a banking crisis and an agency crisis and a mortgage crisis and a coming credit card crisis weve never seen anything like that before and it all seems to be coming home to roost at the same time thats never happened either
2501083 but we did not even have credit cards in the 1930s there were no such thing as student loans
2501084 what ive said is that im playing the hand that was dealt and that my responsibility is to protect the u s economy and the american people
2501085 there were parts of this legislation that just got passed that a number of us found objectionable unnecessary extraneous too much government involvement
2501086 but i found it a simple decision to do so because there was no other good alternative
2501087 paulson and his colleagues philosophically are free market people but when things go wrong you just dont have a lot of choice
2501088 there has been a change in perception that the government needs to play a more active role when we get into a financial crisis the question is to what degree do you say we wont do this again
2501089 we told him we think we need to have an intervention
2501090 its a good example of what government should be doing
2501091 they may be pretending to lead peaceful protests but they actually foment trouble
2501092 it seems that when i do that then they fill it up with briefings and prep and issues and meetings
2501093 last saturday okay that is a down day start out with meetings and it lasts all day long until the evening ah i see
2501094 i think the thing that helps me i probably i dont know if you like this much detail if i can sleep in to about 7 30 or 8 then it really helps me
2501095 when i get up real early like 5 30 or 6 then you know you dont go to bed until 10 10 30 or 11 it seems to help me to get up a little later in the morning
2501096 never cranky or testy i just think i do better i kinda can tell and i think my staff can tell you if i put in three or four 18 hour 20 hour days in a row then im not sharp its just a fact i can be sharp if i get a little more rest
2501097 i like the reaction of people i liked going to the iowa state fair this morning i liked going to sturgis
2501098 grrr grrr grrr i like those things it seems to me that were going to those kinds of things that are really fun that i would never be able to do otherwise
2501099 i think it has been good humor i really do
2501100 first negative ads against me were moveon org against me next was by the democratic national committee against me the next was by senator obama against me those were negative ads and we responded
2501101 nah i cant i have not gambled in years really i cant remember ill figure it out but its been a long time
2501102 i would still dress that way today if it was socially acceptable it was so comfortable

2501158 in the locker room and weight room everyone is going absolutely crazy its an atmosphere ive never seen in the five years ive been here if we keep that up we should have a good season
2501159 staying consistent we had four blocks last year obviously its a team effort and our goal is to be perfect this season
2501160 its back to square one but from the beginning of camp it has been fun and we are just trying to get better
2501161 its great this is a family and its been a family since weve been here some have moved on but new guys come in year after year and become family we have a lot of young guys that are fitting in well
2501162 there has been a lot of hype but first and foremost we are focused on winning another big ten championship everything else we just need to take one step at a time
2501163 all of the freshmen have been really impressive so far we just have so much depth this season and so much talent the freshmen will just make us that much better
2501164 of course every year our main goal is to win the national championship but we also want to win a third straight outright big ten title
2501165 im the hardest hitter i hit every chance i get
2501166 im glad i stayed in high school and experienced my senior year with all of my friends i never really thought about enrolling early and i think i made the right decision
2501167 i like to think that i am versatile and i think the coaches know that they can use me in a lot of different ways
2501168 i feel good i feel light i feel better im ready to play
2501169 obviously our main goal is to win both the big ten and national championship but the main goal is to win the big ten
2501170 its incredible i feel so much better as a running back and as a runner
2501171 hes ready to learn hes always around the older guys trying to pick things up
2501172 im just trying to enjoy everything its so rare that you get to be in the hotel with this group of guys and have fun
2501173 our strength is all the experience were bringing back our weakness is that weve been to the national championship twice and lost twice thats always going to be in the back of our minds and the voters minds we have to get over the hump
2501174 we just have to take it one game at a time our goal is to win the big ten but our first challenge will be youngstown state they always come to play hard to go to the national championship we really have to concentrate on each individual game and take it from there
2501175 everyone is really focused its great to see the young guys are really hungry everybody is in a really good place im excited to see everyone make some good plays this year on defense
2501176 we have potential to go back to play in the bcs title game nobody on the team thinks were guaranteed to go we know we need to work hard for it we know we have potential and maybe we can make it back this year
2501177 ive been working on my conditioning this summer ive also been working on little things like foot placement its my senior year so i need to improve on the little things
2501178 i played basketball with him in pittsburgh and hes an awesome basketball player as an athlete hes a very good athlete when you can run a 4 3 you always have a chance he has a power game to go along with his athleticism
2501179 hes focused he looks a lot stronger and hes lost a lot of weight were glad to have him back and hell be able to help us a lot this season
2501180 you expect more out of yourself as a senior its funny to look back on my freshman year and you wondered why the older guys were so hard on you now i find myself doing the same thing to the younger guys
2501181 ross is a tough and quick kid he plays football and doesnt think too much he is extremely hard working and hopefully hell stay healthy this year
2501182 a lot of us came back for education friendship and the great program that ohio state has coach tressel runs an excellent program here ohio state has a lot of alumni around the world that supports you i also didnt want to miss special times like senior day at the horseshoe
2501183 it was a learning experience as i look back on it now i wouldnt change a thing but at the time it was just a tough situation it made me grow as a player and as a person
2501184 ive tried to maintain the same speed ive always had when i was a linebacker i needed more weight but i was able to keep the speed coach lichter got me in the weight room and now im more of an explosive player
2501185 i think this team has the potential to win every game it plays as long as we stay focused and keep our eyes on the goal we have to get out there and prove ourselves again were excited about our position but at the same time we have a pretty big target on our back
2501186 no reason at the present time to link the death to the camp for climate action protest

2501289 the more often you clean your car the easier it is and the less time it takes
2501290 if i can pinpoint one step that gives the greatest benefit over an automobiles entire life its keeping your cars surfaces the glass trim paint and wheels clean
2501291 you should wash your car a minimum of once a week due to the fact that your car is constantly bombarded with contaminants such as tree sap mist and bird droppings
2501292 if the contaminants are not removed quickly they can bond to the paint and even etch the paint

2501301 deep sea temperatures warmed about 1 300 years before the tropical surface ocean and well before the rise in atmospheric co2
2501302 suggests the rise in greenhouse gas was likely a result of warming
2501303 the co increase lagged antarctic deglacial warming by 800 200 years and preceded the northern hemisphere deglaciation
2501304 the weight per unit of area of a column of air that reaches to the top of the atmosphere
2501305 shifts in rainfall patterns cloud cover and warming temperatures triggered a 6 percent increase in the amount of carbon stored in trees grass shrubs and flowers
2501306 global climate change has eased climatic constraints on plant life around the globe allowing vegetation to increase 6 percent
2501307 increased atmospheric co2 and climate change are the primary causes of the recent u
2501308 when the atmosphere gets hazy like it did after the eruption of mt pinatubo in the philippines in june 1991 plants photosynthesize more efficiently thereby absorbing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
2501309 diversity increases as the planet warms and decreases as it cools

2501311 the southern saharan desert is in retreat making farming viable again in what were some of the most arid parts of africa
2501312 dunes are retreating right across the sahel region on the southern edge of the sahara desert vegetation is ousting sand across a swathe of land stretching from mauritania on the shores of the atlantic to eritrea 6000 kilometres away on the red sea coast
2501313 could significantly increase rainfall in saharan africa within a few decades potentially ending the severe droughts that have devastated the region
2501314 significantly changes the planets distance from the sun during its long year which lasts 248 earth years
2501315 in the midst of a global change that can modify temperatures by as much as 10 degrees fahrenheit
2501316 global warming has finally been explained the earth is getting hotter because the sun is burning more brightly than at any time during the past 1 000 years according to new research
2501317 suggests that increasing radiation from the sun is responsible for recent global climate changes
2501318 is brighter than it was a few hundred years ago and this brightening started relatively recently in the last 100 to 150 years
2501319 simultaneous warming on earth and mars suggests that our planets recent climate changes have a natural and not a human induced cause
2501320 habibullo abdussamatov head of space research at st petersburgs pulkovo astronomical observatory in russia says the mars data is evidence that the current global warming on earth is being caused by changes in the sun
2501321 changes in the suns heat output can account for almost all the climate changes we see on both planets
2501322 similar to the warming experienced on earth over approximately the same period
2501323 suggests rapid changes in planetary climates could be natural phenomena
2501324 some planetary climate changes may be due to variations in the solar system environment
2501325 its very disturbing that we do not understand the climate on a planet that is so much like the earth
2501326 it is telling us that we really dont understand the earth we have ended up with a lot of mysteries
2501327 thick atmosphere traps solar radiation and heats the world to boiling point
2501328 carbon dioxide is absorbed by the oceans where it forms carbonate minerals and over the millennia is deposited as rock
2501329 a study of sea temperature changes predicts a lull as traditional climate cycles cancel out the heating effect of greenhouse gases from pollution
2501330 global warming will be put on hold over the next decade because of natural climate variations
2501331 snow cover over north america and much of siberia mongolia and china is greater than at any time since 1966
2501332 that there is anthropological and geological evidence of much greater melts in the past
2501333 climate models until now have not properly accounted for the winds effects on ocean circulation so researchers have compensated by over emphasizing the role of manmade warming on polar ice melt
2501334 as a result of the cold la nina current in the pacific
2501335 its a really bad thing for a scientist to have an immovable intractable position
2501336 the oceans have not warmed up at all over the past four or five years that could mean global warming has taken a breather
2501337 the oceans are what really matter when it comes to global warming
2501338 in the past 70 years the sun was more active than at almost any other time in the last 11 400 years
2501339 global warming and other environmental insults were threatening the planet with catastrophe
2501340 the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossil fuels and requires immediate action
2501341 1 500 clergy theologians religious leaders scientists academics and policy experts concerned about the harm that kyoto could inflict on the worlds poor
2501342 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate moreover there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the earth
2501343 when politicians and journalists declare that the science of global warming is settled they show a regrettable ignorance about how science works
2501344 climate research became politicized in favour of one particular hypothesis
2501345 often imagine that anyone who doubts the hypothesis of man made global warming must be in the pay of the oil companies as a result some key discoveries in climate research go almost unreported
2501346 cloudiness varies according to how many atomic particles are coming in from exploded stars

2501360 i would love it if a guy pulled out one of those because then it would show that hes aware of my pleasure i think its a considerate gesture
2501361 theyre really hard to turn on once everything gets slippery we spent a good five minutes trying to turn the thing on before we finally gave up
2501362 have you ever heard about the vibrating ring its a little a ring that goes on the penis and at the top theres a tiny little vibrator and when youre having sex it touches right on your clitoris and its amaaazing

2501413 one of the phenomenal things is that we have such a great governor in this state he did a phenomenal job in his own campaign with reaching out to religious constituencies and we have just an outstanding office of faith based and community initiatives whose director is also very engaged and involved in making sure the religious community is part of the governors operation
2501414 weve created a situation where people of faith in this state are used to hearing from a democrat now which may have not been the case before
2501415 we had put in a proposal to the odp and tried to reach them several times and never heard back but i dont know what they were actually considering or not considering
2501416 i was in conversations with them and they indicated that they were going to have a position
2501417 there was an effort under way to fund this initiative if they were willing to accept it but they never really followed through
2501418 lets just say there wasnt a lot of traction there
2501419 the largest swing voters in ohio are as we all know are catholics the idea that it was not part of the strategy i find from where im standing disappointing
2501420 i dont pay a lot of attention to it this is the third time i went through this with dole i went through this with bush and now my name has surfaced with mccain its always nice im flattered by it but my attention is focused on ohio
2501421 my life is pretty much packed into my racquet bag
2501422 i want to say that people should get ready for sacrifice and struggle
2501423 we will support the amarnath yatra sangharsh samiti and will take this issue to people across india we will not let the government have double standards
2501424 its so within reach now that its scary you know
2501425 every single year we accomplish a new feat but it has been an uphill battle
2501426 we are from the flint area and weve always been fans of i decay
2501427 weve always thought they had the potential they have a great sound and theyre hard working it just took a business plan and we felt that we could help them move forward
2501428 its not a metal bar its not even a music bar
2501429 it was just full of old regulars coming in going what the hell is all this those shows weren t our biggest high profile shows but they are unforgettable
2501430 the place was tiny so 50 people looked like 300
2501431 we actually went on to get banned from that place the things that went on in there are unexplainable
2501432 since then weve just been trying to keep the momentum going playing shows keeping in good contact with venues and other bigger band to help platform our careers
2501433 that got us two songs recorded but they really liked us and said they wanted to record the rest of our cd
2501434 they gave us a killer deal on it and when we were in the studio with mushroomhead they mentioned us touring with them buying on to a tour so we scraped a bunch of money together and got to go on a whole u s tour with them last fall
2501435 i see them in the near future coming up with a very tight brutal new recording of a full length album and shopping it around to labels
2501436 i see them being very big in europe and asia and signing with a very reputable record label
2501437 they very much represent flint area that blue collar hard working mentality that the area is known for
2501438 its the determination and the hard work we put into it a lot of bands have similar influences so naturally they can sound the same but its all about the hard work and the time you put into it

2501444 we see a much greater reaction the closer to home it is
2501445 if its indonesia we see some reaction but a lot of times people dont respond to foreign country disasters whether it was the earthquake in sichuan china this year or the tsunamis
2501446 in this post katrina environment i think theres been a paradigm shift of the american public
2501447 when people saw during katrina all of the folks stranded on roofs and that the fire department the government emergency employees could not get to them for three or more days the thinking really changed

2501454 the entire philosophy of the devil resides in not recognising god in the world not recognising his presence in the world not recognising his incarnation in the world it upholds and teaches that god is neither in the world nor in man and even less so in the god man

2501478 while theoretical models of the role of culture in m amp a emphasise the dark side of cultural diversity

2501480 cultural differences may actually have a positive effect on aspects of the socio cultural integration process such as the cultural sensitivity and tolerance exhibited by the acquiring firm managers
2501481 organisational cultural differences were generally found to have a negative impact in domestic settings
2501482 whether cultural differences have a positive or a negative impact or any impact at all depends on the performance measures examined and on the nature and extent of cultural differences the integration approach taken the interventions chosen to manage cultural differences and a variety of other factors rather than asking if cultural differences have a performance impact in m amp a future research endeavours should focus on how cultural differences affect the integration process

2501756 the textbook provides a lucid introduction to the field of survivability offering even the layperson a basic understanding of issues to be considered but it doesnt do so at the expense of its core audience the student engineer ball illustrates clearly the complexity of dealing with an attack on aircraft very effective at graphically illustrating the ideas useful and relevant tables and equations are numerous although the publication focuses on military aircraft both fixed wing and helicopters there are clear implications and lessons to be gleaned for commercial airliners which have now also become potential targets
2501757 the only book on the aircraft survivability discipline that speaks to both the operator and the engineer the bible of aircraft survivability
2501758 prof balls first textbook served as the bible for the survivability community for the last 20 years and his new textbook is even better and should serve as the bible for the next 20 years he did a great job on this textbook
2501759 i highly recommend prof balls revised text to professionals with a direct or indirect interest in aircraft survivability it contains a wealth of information relevant to improving the survivability of our combat aircraft and to understanding how design decisions affect aircraft survivability the revised text is especially timely given the increased incidence of threats against civilian aircraft for those concerned about aircraft survivability there is no comparable resource
2501760 the second edition of dr balls landmark work fundamentals of aircraft combat survivability analysis and design is of the same high quality as the first edition but with the information updated to reflect todays world the book contains something for everyone there is analytical rigor for the experienced specialist as well as top level overviews that are useful to non specialists who wish to gain an understanding of survivability this book is the most complete discussion of survivability available in an unclassified source many practitioners of the survivability discipline consider themselves students of dr ball even if they have never been in his classroom he is credited with establishing survivability as a formal engineering discipline this book belongs on the desk of everyone who works in the survivability field
2501761 i believe that the text will project a reference point that enriches the sources of research for any aircraft survivability project

2501928 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2501929 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2501930 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2501931 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2501932 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2501933 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2501934 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2501935 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2501936 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2501937 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2501938 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2501939 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2501940 who are open to doing something on the production side
2501941 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2501942 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2501943 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2501944 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2501945 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2501946 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2501947 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2501948 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2501949 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2501950 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2501951 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2501952 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2501953 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2501954 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2501955 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2501956 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2501957 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2501958 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2501959 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2501960 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2501961 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2501962 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2501963 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2501964 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2501965 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2501966 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2501967 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2501968 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2501969 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2501970 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2501971 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2501972 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2501973 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2501974 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2501975 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2501976 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2501977 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2501978 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2501979 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2501980 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2501981 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2501982 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

2501992 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2501993 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2501994 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2501995 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2501996 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2501997 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2501998 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2501999 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2502000 we have found an innovative way to kill the virus by finding this small region of hiv that is unchangeable
2502001 im on four different medications three of them are brand new and its the first time that ive ever been non detectible
2502002 im down to about just for the hiv about nine pills per day five in the morning and four at night
2502003 the virus is truly complex and has many tricks up its sleeve
2502004 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2502005 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2502006 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2502007 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2502008 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2502009 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

2502023 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2502024 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2502025 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2502026 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2502027 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2502028 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2502029 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2502030 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

2502052 questions i cant get off my mind why wasnt indymac bank whose problems were well known in the financial community not on the fdics list of troubled institutions until shortly before its failure this month each quarter the fdic discloses how many banks and thrifts are on its problem list it does not name which institutions make the list because if if did depositors would yank out their money and they would almost surely fail indymac was obviously not on the list a fact confirmed by the fdic after its failure the fdic says it was added in june indymac started going to hell in the second half of last year when it lost its ability to sell mortgages it made to investors says bank consultant bert ely highline financial is one of several companies that rate the safety of banks and thrifts its scale ranges from 99 best to zero worst its indymac rating fell from 55 at the end of 2006 to 1 at the end of last year in march it was rated zero christopher whalen managing director of institutional risk analytics says everyone expects regulators to be ahead of the curve but they never are its hard for regulators to be proactive if the fdic was beating the hell out of indymac a year ago the congressmen that represent indymac would have been all over them

2502174 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2502175 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2502176 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2502177 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2502178 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2502179 and now the vietnamese who have had more success in the international mathematics olympiad where they have won more than 150 medals than here at the summer olympics where their all time total is 1
2502180 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2502181 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2502182 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2502189 might reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage
2502190 what has been received in faith from scripture and tradition
2502191 if you want to move the world move a congregation
2502192 all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness
2502193 arthur walkington pink 1886 1952 was an evangelist and biblical scholar born in scotland he devoted his life to god
2502194 the survival of the bible through the ages is very difficult to explain if it is not in truth the word of god books are like men dying creatures a very small percentage of books survive more than twenty years a yet smaller percentage last a hundred years and only a very insignificant fraction represent those which have lived a thousand years amid the wreck and ruin of ancient literature the holy bible stands out like the last survivor of an otherwise extinct race and the very fact of the bibles continued existence is an indication that like its author it is indestructible
2502195 when we bear in mind the fact that the bible has been the special object of never ending persecution the wonder of the bibles survival is changed into a miracle not only has the bible been the most intensely loved book in the entire world but it has also been the most bitterly hated not only has the bible received more veneration and adoration than any other book but it has also been the object of more persecution and opposition for two thousand years mans hatred of the bible has been persistent determined relentless and murderous every possible effort has been made to undermine faith in the inspiration and authority of the bible and innumerable enterprises have been undertaken with the determination to consign it to oblivion imperial edicts have been issued to the effect that every known copy of the bible should be destroyed and when this measure failed to exterminate and annihilate gods word then commands were given that every person found with a copy of the scriptures in his possession should be put to death the very fact that the bible has been so singled out for such relentless persecution causes us to wonder at such a unique phenomenon
2502196 although the bible is the best book in the world it has produced more enmity and opposition than has the combined contents of all our libraries
2502197 heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away
2502198 the story of the bibles persecution is an arresting one
2502199 the christian religion is destroyed and the worship of the gods restored
2502200 even in our day the persecution of the bible still continues though the method of attack is changed much of our modern scholarship is engaged in the work of seeking to destroy faith in the divine inspiration and authority of the bible in many of our seminaries the rising generations of the clergy are taught that genesis is a book of myths that much of the teaching of the pentateuch is immoral that the historical records of the old testament are unreliable and that the whole bible is mans creation rather than gods revelation and so the attack on the bible is being perpetuated
2502201 now suppose there was a man who had lived upon this earth for two thousand years that this man had oftentimes been thrown into the sea and yet could not be drowned that he had frequently been cast before wild beasts who were unable to devour him that he had many times been made to drink deadly poisons which never did him any harm that he had often been bound in iron chains and locked in prison dungeons yet he had always been able to throw off the chains and escape from his captivity that he had repeatedly been hanged till his enemies thought him dead yet when his body was cut down he sprang to his feet and walked away as though nothing had happened that hundreds of times he had been burned at the stake till there seemed to be nothing left of him yet as soon as the fires were out he leaped up from the ashes as well and as vigorous as ever but we need not expand this idea any further such a man would be super human a miracle of miracles
2502202 the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of our god shall abide for ever

2502209 my opponent doesnt want to drill he wants to inflate your tires
2502210 most presidential candidates fly at about 15 000 ft barack obama has been living at 30 000 ft
2502211 the idea was lets not try to pull him down from that plane and be mad about it lets push him up to 50 000 ft and create an updraft that sends icarus a little closer to the sun
2502212 obamas foreign trip was the last proof that we needed so it is what it is
2502213 if you want to move the world move a congregation
2502214 you can all help shape fresh more honest and more constructive ways of being a conference and being a communion the conference seeks to build up a trustful community in this time together one reason we began with a retreat so that our common trust in god could be renewed
2502215 we must be honest about how deep some of the hurts and difficulties currently go and we must refresh and reanimate our sense of what our communion ought to be contributing to the whole ecumenical spectrum of christian life

2502273 one of the most gifted bassists of his generation is finding his own voice as a composer
2502274 i would like to draw your attention to the parable that was read as the gospel the words of the master were wise words let them grow together there can and there must be no uprooting simply because if we attempt this game of uprooting the unrighteous then my dear sisters and brothers none of us will remain we are all a mix of the wheat and the weeds the wisdom of these words suggest that we stay together because we draw from a common soil a common tradition a common heritage we are what we are regardless of our differences because of our common life together and our origins transformation comes in this interaction and transformation must come from within
2502275 as i look around and see you i see this wonderful unity in diversity shortly when the sacrament is administered lips from numerous countries numerous nationalities numerous cultures will touch the same cup we are united in spite of the fact that we are different because in christ we are equal theres enough to go around if none will be greedy here my dear sisters and brothers is an insight of what the church is called to be an inclusive communion where there is space equally for everyone and anyone regardless of colour gender ability sexual orientation unity in diversity is a cherished anglican tradition a spirituality if you like which we must reinforce in all humility for the sake of christ and christs gospel

2502279 i know that most people think the news story here is about divisive controversies over sexuality but my sense is that the real news story is very different
2502280 my sense is that the quiet prayerful and humble patience of archbishop rowan williams is leading the way to better days for the anglican communion it feels like the bishops gathered here are turning a corner together i feel that im witnessing the emergence of something good beautiful true and blessed hearts here are sincerely open to the spirit of god
2502281 if you want to move the world move a congregation
2502282 in which every voice can be heard and in which we build christian relationship
2502283 is not that after two weeks we will find a solution to all our problems but we shall as i have written more than once in some sense find the trust in god and one another that will give us the energy to change in the way god wants us to change that is the most important thing we can pray for the energy to change as god wants us to change individually and as a communion
2502284 i think were off to a very good start i have an overwhelmingly positive feeling for today a great deal of community building occurred among my brother and sister bishops there was an air of optimism and hope its not that we expect that all the problems of the anglican communion will be solved in the next two weeks but an indispensable foundation for the future of the anglican communion will be laid

2502287 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2502288 i think they need to work through that process of healing
2502289 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself

2502314 im not too upset about it what was it a bunch of singles and three doubles im just not real upset about it im just going to move on and ive already done that
2502315 it was a team where everyone demanded complete effort it was not a team where anyone ever said nice try when you made a long run after a fly ball and didnt get to it i played on a lot of other teams and they
2502316 jesus christ a twenty year old kid and he cant play both ends of a doubleheader when were fighting down the stretch what kind of bullshit is this
2502317 airing crap like that remake of nbc executive session leno office spin off and infronts tca report poehler will not be in an office spin off but rashida jones may reprise karen tca report
2502318 if i were you id like to think id wait be patient and watch the real version when it was available its definitely something weve had conversations about the most important thing for us is that wed be able to do show as weve always done it
2502319 running time is one thing having more story time there are other possibilities concerning content that well consider
2502320 we felt like this is what the show was always about from the very beginning as true to life and authentic as possible as much as we love scott and gaius we had to be true to whats happening to these characters
2502321 being in the thrid year of the show and have it live to this point it was time to start to take things seriously about what grade they were in we blurred the lines a little bit to tell stories but now were making a commitment
2502322 from the beginning jason said wed do show for only a few years
2502323 we fely like if we started from where we left off there was an arc of stories we could tell but it felt too weird to tell those stories
2502324 and then move forward eight months we didnt plan for it but there was something interesting about cutting ahead
2502325 having to cut the season short in december because of the strike that was kind of devestating
2502326 we didnt get to finish the season we said goodbye and we didnt know if it was last time or not
2502327 were the university of alabama we dont play second fiddle to anyone
2502328 it was mr clarke with a lead pipe at the convenience store
2502329 i love it you love it unfortunately no one watches it thats the thing with shows people have to watch them were nbc we have a reputation to uphold and man with this writers strike well well see what we can do but start watching 30 rock
2502330 you left me for a better job youre daughter left me for a better guy carlotta left me for guatemala my dad left me for a damn war everybody leaves me is there something wrong with me
2502331 i just dont want to see you become an at risk youth
2502332 ok they got past that one now maybe that well adjusted good kid we met in season one will come back
2502333 wir alle erleben die umfassenden ver nderungen im wirtschaftsleben globalisierung beschleunigung neue formen der wertsch pfung im rahmen virtueller sozialer netzwerke wie die zukunft von arbeit und wirtschaft unter dem einfluss technologischer ver nderungen aussieht ist thema von talk the future
2502334 im trying to find about a tv show that was in the 1990s that was cancelled it was about a guy living in the city he would look at the newspaper the newspaper told the future he would see a disaster and then save the person do you know the name of this tv show
2502335 i never understood why he didnt just flip to the sports page and then run to his bookie
2502336 if you ever touch one of my players youll never coach another football game as long as you live
2502337 i wonder what street is up to right about now
2502338 i would put her in a coma thats what i would do
2502339 so literally i was at a baseball game with steve mcpherson and the most surprising part of this story would be that i was at a baseball game
2502340 carlton and i were on the writers guild negotiating committee together and we would be in this room trying to plot strategy against the producers alliance and people would always go okay look its the fourth down we have to approach this i go why is it all sports metaphors why doesnt anybody use musical theater metaphors so i actually got them to try to use eliza doolittle as a comparison on occasion
2502341 all the difference in the world we now basically knew exactly how much time we had left to tell our story and we were basically able to blast towards that ending i think that really completely changed our storytelling approach
2502342 the thing that was just so sad was that a writer one of you guys saw it but from one perspective
2502343 weve killed a lot of white people i can almost guarantee you we will be killing more white people this season
2502344 hopefully as it plays out people wont feel that way and we certainly arent designing the story in the same way
2502345 we have to get more kyle and connie in this script
2502346 hold on now didnt we just go through how tami was ready to quit her job because she didnt have enough time for everything
2502347 man they sure are making sure to show that it is a tahoe hybrid
2502348 we got guarantees that the parliament the democratic institutions the political parties and freedom will continue to exist
2502349 we leave reassured about the situation in the country its stability and security
2502350 currently we are not going to release the ousted president because of security concerns
2502351 if theres a coup in the country the participation in the activities of the african union are not available to them
2502352 last season wasnt he supposed to be intelligent and logical
2502353 apart from his housing troubles i thought eric making tim his gofer was pretty funny especially his comments at the gymnastics meet about stacies double backs of course that does call into question tamis earlier concerns about his grades
2502354 i know what you did last fall by the grocery store
2502355 wir haben einen bombe in der kartagam area gefunden sie ist hnlich zu denen die wir vorher fanden wir haben sie entsch rft
2502356 it was a tough day of test cricket and tomorrow will be the same
2502357 obviously well be looking at getting as many runs in front as we possibly can and then bowl them out again
2502358 theres still a lot of hard work to be done in this match
2502359 sanga held the innings together all day we needed someone to anchor the innings and thats exactly what he did today
2502360 the concentration he shows batting for long periods of time is what makes him world class he showed that out there today in difficult conditions
2502361 so der titel des neuesten teils seit seinem us start am 18
2502362 w re das spiel zeitgleich mit dem kinofilm gestartet h tte es sich in der zwischenzeit locker vier mio mal verkauft und 100 mio dollar an zus tzlichen ums tzen eingebracht
2502363 es ist in der videospielbranche inzwischen durchaus blich dass videospielumsetzungen fast zeitgleich zu den kinofilmen auf den markt kommen
2502364 videospielumsetzungen sind nat rlich besonders f r fans des films oder der filmreihe anziehend erst durch das spiel k nnen sie ihre lieblingscharaktere und szenen aus dem film interaktiv und virtuell erfahren und zwar so oft sie wollen und jedes mal auf eine neue art und weise
2502365 i dont think ive ever said this but that seems overpriced

2502367 the highly anticipated american version of the british hit life on mars david e kelly boston legal is behind that and his successful track record adds to the hope that this version will be as good as the uk creation
2502368 i got a call from abc entertainment chief steve mcpherson saying that cashmere mafia was most likely not going to come back and that he still wanted to work with me and keep me in the family
2502369 i think hopefully the first episode will allow it will work for returning viewers but it also will work for new viewers theres no learning curve to come back to the show and i think that will work for you know we will work very quickly the audience will be here
2502370 i was shocked when that all went down far moreso than i ever was with the president clinton its shocking because every time ive been with a hooker theres never been any electronic trail whatsoever
2502371 i mean if im not that stupid how could he be that stupid the guy graduated from frickin harvard you know what i mean
2502372 this season were honing in on really making it a show that the stories tell more of the ethical dilemmas that our doctors have to face there is surgery in it because addison is a surgeon and she gets back to doing that
2502373 for me the thing about writing is that the characters end up sort of doing what im doing at the moment and the first season we were it was the first time id had two shows going at the same time it was the first time addison moved to los angeles it was addison finding her footing i was finding the show so i feel like both of those things are stronger now
2502374 it sort of dawned on me a few days ago we were shooting im like oh addison has never been happy personally shes never had anybody that really likes her derek was like get away and karev was just a curmudgeon so now theres actually some kind of fun and love and romance
2502375 we found out a little about what both berlanti and pp creator shonda rhimes have in store and how they deal with returning from such a long break
2502376 since the pilot i felt like the show had some of the best potential for storytelling and exploration of characters both on the light and the dark side
2502377 its more about keeping all the best elements and adding as much intrigue drama and danger as we possibly can
2502378 there is a real desire to essentially relaunch dirty sexy money and private practice panels lots of resetting going on tca report abc show runner panel heigl losts endpoint and musical theater tca report oreo said
2502379 an international soccer star is on his way to sign a multi million dollar contract when a series of events unfold that bring his career to a abrupt end a beautiful waitress struggling to make it in new york city discovers something about herself that she in unprepared for in one irreversible moment their lives are turned upside down until a simple gesture of kindness brings them both together turning an ordinary day into an unforgettable experience
2502380 we do think theres an opportunity after this eighth season
2502381 if any or all the cast is a part of that i think theres a growth opportunity there its a show that despite being moved around into like 17 time periods and really never being given the marketing support has really performed unbelievably well on nbc
2502382 we have kind of the advantage going in that we felt that we really had a dominant fall and a real strong core schedule so we didnt need that much new programming
2502383 and we also decided really early on that we werent going to kind of announce in may shows that didnt exist that hadnt been developed or shot or piloted and gone through the regular process
2502384 but were really just going to do things when theyre ready we still have windows of opportunity to launch shows i dont think its going to be a process where you are just going to have randomly pilots throughout the year
2502385 it gave us a lot more prep time on the writing side and enabled us to get to more episodes before summer end you know we were looking at the possibility of the sag strike and it allowed a little bit of protection against that
2502386 there was a lot of talking a lot of time in the coffee room taking about the angst thats not that show its not what shonda rhimes the creator does well
2502387 i think its unfortunate when theres any kind of turmoil on a show theres so many people who work so unbelievably hard to make that show the 1 show in the country everyone from the grips to the writers to the eps i think deserves an enormous amount of credit and i never like to see when any of them are in any way taken lightly so i think that was really unfortunate
2502388 which is really much more in keeping with what we wanted to get accomplished originally
2502389 i think the second seasons first episode back when we saw the rough cut i dont think they were personally what anybody wanted
2502390 i think sometimes when were really passionate about things we try to convince ourselves that theres a real audience for them
2502391 i applaud cbs for jericho there was a huge groundswell but groundswell and success dont necessarily match up
2502392 they didnt have to fill some undetermined middle of the show
2502393 i really like being able to know when shows are going out i think its as big a decision as a lost decision a couple years out its really good to know as opposed to doing you know with scrubs is it on again is it going to not be on lets let these creators who have created unbelievably compelling characters and iconic pieces of television lets let them end it with dignity and integrity and to me compelling content and we can market it as such
2502394 a guy travels through time trying to make right what once went wrong
2502395 create a dynasty or dallas for the new millennium with more self awareness

2502423 it is the worlds deepest volcanic ridge and totally unexplored
2502424 we are hoping to find several different types of vents along the ridge
2502425 some of the vents will be very similar in depth to the vents we already know about and because the conditions will be alike we might expect very similar animals
2502426 the deep ocean is our planets largest ecosystem if we are going to use its resources responsibly then we need understand what determines its patterns of life
2502427 they could be hotter than 500c 930f and if they are that hot they will probably have quite different chemistry and life forms we expect to find new species
2502428 give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast ye your pearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you
2502429 the issue of condoms which are very fundamental have been left out completely the money goes to churches but unfortunately this money has specifically been designed for what i would call moralistic behavior and so i am not surprised that there is an upsurge of hiv in this country
2502430 i have been a preacher for 33 years now so when i believed jesus and when i started reading the bible i knew that jesus said go into the whole world and preach the gospel and also heal the sick in my name we pray for the sick people some of them get healed and some dont and if they dont get healed we refer them to hospital you cant impose healing on some body if some body doesnt get healed where does he go to the hospital
2502431 there is a group especially from the american community who has been funding initiatives that are basically faith based in approach
2502432 the aids commission still promotes abc as a strategy in fact we are talking of abc plus because there are new initiatives that have come on board like medical male circumcisions like anti retroviral therapy like increased voluntary counseling and testing and empowerment of women
2502433 people in the communities are still having a lot of problems people are still dying even if drugs are there there is not sufficient education about these drugs and so the problems are still very big many other people have come in religious institutions come in others says they can heal hiv others have become very condemnatory you find these new sects saying people should not use condoms that condoms are not accepted and they should not even be promoted there are what i would call conflicting messages that are going around
2502434 we already have a collection of ideas from the grassroots we can no longer plan anything at the national level without getting the involvement of the local communities at the end of the day that is where the majority of our people live
2502435 out of 1 2 million people who have hiv 350 000 should be on arvs now the figures we get from the ministry of health are that only about 150 000 people out of 350 000 are actually getting arvs but most people who need these drugs in uganda are not getting them
2502436 we are heading out on two expeditions each close to a month long to map the full length of the cayman trough
2502437 it is the worlds deepest volcanic ridge and totally unexplored

2502444 lah dongengan ini kan sudah jalan sejak dulu ta le baguslah kalau pak sby sudah mau membantu
2502445 yang ada selama ini menunjukkan bahwa kita masih menemukannya juga kan
2502446 itu maksudnya karena lima tahun terakhir ini ada kenaikan harga bbm dan diversifikasi yang mengurangi laju kebutuhan minyak di dalam negeri
2502447 halllah pakdhe mau bilang kalau pemerintah sekarang sukses gitu ya emang pakdhe dapat apa sih
2502448 hust kalau sukses ya dibilang sukses kalau amburadul ya di kritik kan gitu
2502449 wah walaupun minyak dibilang hanya 20 nya saja ternyata kebutuhan ditahun 2025 juga meningkat ya pakdhe trus siapa yang mengisi kekurangannya
2502450 looh pakdhe kita kan ada energi primer lain termasuk geothermal yang selalu pakdhe bilang 40 dari cadangan dunia juga ada batubara energi angin air dsb ta
2502451 betul thole itu bisa saja dipakai tetapi yang jelas ken pp 05 2005 harus direvisi atau direvisit dulu karena saat ini ken ini merupakan salah satu pedoman praktis dan operasional dan menjadi pegangan buktinya geothermal hanya ditargetkan kurang dari 10 walaupun cadangannya 9 milyar barrel ekivalent tetapi geothermal tidak menjadi target utama dalam ken yang ada thole makanya terseok seok jalannya

2502464 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2502465 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2502466 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2502467 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2502468 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2502469 as for as da abkh zia em resposta agress o da ge rgia contra a oss tia do sul iniciaram uma opera o na regi o de kodori para limp la da presen a ilegal de for as georgeanas

2502471 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2502472 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2502473 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2502869 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected

2502872 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2502873 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2502874 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

2503117 the normality of it all is what is so surprising
2503118 as a work of art we dont want to just show the panel but to put it back as it was intended
2503119 like taking a loaf of bread and cutting it into slices
2503120 it is extraordinarily rare to fine an embalming board wrapped into a mummy
2503121 it could be evidence of the ancient egyptian custom of placing a scarab over the heart with an inscription that instructs the heart not to act as a hostile witness when he is judged in the next world
2503122 the heart acts as a positive witness at the trial of each person
2503123 herodotus the fifth century greek historian tells us to leave the heart
2503124 they all had extraordinarily well painted portraits and pigments that were not common
2503125 either he had an easy life or was carried around a lot
2503126 he certainly didnt do much heavy lifting during his lifetime

2503138 men seem to look at me and think she went out with george clooney what chance have i got
2503139 i wore a loose fitting t shirt it was very hot in london and its no secret i dont like wearing bras
2503140 my boob fell out twice and people on the blogs are saying it was a publicity stunt
2503141 can i just say i have been keeping myself very much to myself recently
2503142 if i wanted publicity id be accepting invitations not to mention money for turning up to glamorous events
2503143 we didnt have waves in my day these kids dont know how good they have it
2503144 now whos gonna be token black guy for the next oceans 11 sequel
2503145 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital no other details are available at this time we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2503146 they didnt have a strong point of view on digital media
2503147 we were an advisor for them on how to move into the new media space taking into account their mission of voter education
2503148 myspaces piece of the partnership is less about the debates themselves we dont have any editorial control over how the debates are run
2503149 our role is to create a suite of online tools that helps people take what theyve learned in the debates and organize it and process it and decide who to vote for
2503150 theres a pretty hard line between myspace and the mydebates world
2503151 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2503152 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2503153 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2503154 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2503155 its hard to describe the feeling as you walk though the seemingly endless lines of stones
2503156 i knew i had to go 43 i didnt want to take any chances with the last heat going all best times leaving me out in the dust so i put a lot into it i didnt really have much of a choice
2503157 i would have preferred to go a little easier but that being said ive still got some gas in the tank for tomorrow
2503158 look how close it is its anybodys at this stage
2503159 its just a matter of doing everything right between now and sundays final
2503160 ive done the work and ill do the best i can to compete for my country tomorrow
2503161 i knew it would be quick but not quite that quick i didnt think 43 1 would be the fastest i thought maybe 44 or 43 8 everyone had to work hard thats for sure
2503162 irgendwie scheint alles leichter einfacher sch ner im sommer wenn es warm ist wenn die sonne scheint liegt das wirklich nur am wetter oder liegt es an uns an dem was wir machen an den perfekten tagen
2503163 hes my co star and we get along really well so all the women reading this can be happy and can continue having their crush on him
2503164 and that would spell out amazing things for the future in terms of what we could do with that light
2503165 there has been a lot of interest in scaling down optical devices
2503166 its really a very simple geometry and i was surprised that no one had come up with it before
2503167 previously if you wanted to transmit light at a smaller scale you would lose a lot of energy along the path to retain more energy youd have to make the scale bigger these two things always went against each other
2503168 now this work shows there is the possibility to gain both of them
2503169 we are pulling optics down to the length scales of electrons
2503170 and that means we can potentially do some things we have never done before
2503171 by next june the three ironic 55 storey hotel blocks should be completed
2503172 hopefully it will get them in the right frame of mind to want to eventually marry and have babies
2503173 look its eroding its an older show its eventually going to give up and were trying to accelerate that
2503174 in the fall fox puts the moment of the truth against survivor in the spring the newly resurgent hell s kitchen goes into the spot
2503175 how about something like the world peace reality show where everyone goes around and tries to create peace in different countries
2503176 the producers actually came to me about being on the show but i ended up picking celebrity circus because it was even more interesting to me
2503177 i dont know if i would eat bugs though i think i would rather eat my own arm

2503223 siamo alla ricerca di avere opportunit in tutto il mondo
2503224 this is the first time i have ever seen beach volleyball it certainly is great to watch
2503225 they are very sexy and have splendid shapes it is great to see so many beautiful girls
2503226 i have never seen people get so excited when there are no chinese players involved i wish i could get a ticket to come again
2503227 i just want to get up and dance with all the other spectators you certainly do get a lot of passion from the music i adore brazilians playing soccer and i love watching this too
2503228 there is a great energy in the place which can only be good for players
2503229 making this marriage of substantial processing power computing resources and data resources work efficiently seamlessly and transparently is the challenge
2503230 obey the strange principles of quantum physics whereby disturbing the state of one will instantly disturb the other no matter how much distance there is in between them
2503231 increasing options for content the heavy buying of expensive flat tvs and rational prices for the mid level remote have all played to increase consumers willingness to purchase and desire for the more capable control benefits
2503232 u s households are spending more on their entertainment equipment as well as on content options than in the past
2503233 spending some hundreds of dollars on a urc that allows easier use and management of their home theater systems makes more sense to them than in the past
2503234 we really wanted to focus on comedy and we had the goods to it this year
2503235 weve been looking to expand to build out to another night we have two of highest testing new comedies weve had in years
2503236 women watch our procedurals and comedies and we wanted to build on that weve added more female faces to the network

2503238 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2503239 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2503240 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2503241 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2503242 we were able to experiment at glenville because things were so bad that if we got a first down we got a standing ovation
2503243 from there we tweaked and developed it over the years at tulane clemson and west virginia
2503244 the version we run here at michigan likely will be different than what weve done before
2503245 ive played for some of the greatest offensive minds in the game such as mike martz dennis green tom moore and jon gruden and coach rod adapts his system to his personnel as well as anyone
2503246 i could throw the football so we passed a lot woody was a playmaker but coach rod came up with ways to get the ball to wide receiver rod gardner
2503247 pat white couldnt hit the broadside of a barn when he got to west virginia but coach rod figured out a way to use him and steve slaton by running the option out of a shotgun
2503248 ive always told my wife and coaches that if i ever have a big time job im still going to take a small time approach with my office door open to anybody who wants to talk to me
2503249 the best advice i ever got was just be yourself and im going to do that even if im coaching the super bowl champions in the nfl
2503250 at first i didnt like coach rod because he has a very volatile personality on the field and he uses abrasive language
2503251 he does it because he wants to put so much pressure on you to be perfect in practice that youll be prepared for games
2503252 its amazing though how hes completely different off the field he really cares about his players and hes a family guy who loves his wife and children
2503253 if people knew more stuff like that maybe there wouldnt be so many misconceptions about who he is
2503254 we reden niet rapper dan op training maar de omstandigheden waren zo zwaar ik had de kracht van een nieuweling
2503255 would stretch from here to the hillendale golf course and motor home bonanza the quartzite sports vacation and rv show
2503256 ik ben z veel geduldiger geworden als mijn kinderen ruzie maken geef ik ze ruimte voor hun emoties ik denk dan bij mezelf niet direct reageren maar waarnemen zonder te oordelen zijn zonder te doen
2503257 ik stuurde mijn moeder een foto van mezelf met een kaal hoofd en kleurig gewaad daar schrok ze wel van
2503258 mijn ouders zijn me er komen opzoeken de abt van het klooster vroeg mijn vader mediteert u ook nee zei mijn vader maar ik lees er wel boeken over waarop de abt weer zei alleen door te kijken naar een appel proef je niet de ware smaak ervan
2503259 je kunt wijs worden door boeken te lezen of mensen te spreken
2503260 maar dat kan ook door je in te keren door je ogen te sluiten en in je lichaam en je geest te kijken
2503261 ik heb me lang afgevraagd ik raak steeds uitgeput wat doe ik niet goed
2503262 na een tijd zoeken kwam ik uit bij aandachtsoefeningen die hebben me vertrouwd gemaakt met mijn adem en mijn innerlijke processen
2503263 dan leef ik in een soort droomwereld deze vorm van meditatie houdt me nuchter
2503264 steeds vaker stop ik om even waar te nemen ik ben z veel geduldiger geworden als mijn kinderen ruzie maken geef ik ze ruimte voor hun emoties ik denk dan bij mezelf karin niet direct reageren maar waarnemen zonder te oordelen zijn zonder te doen
2503265 donderdagavond om half elf stuurde een collega me een sms dat ze me een document had gemaild ik vroeg me af moet ik dat nu bekijken mijn perfectionisme zou ja zeggen maar ik dacht nu aan deze prikkel h ef ik niet toe te geven door meditatie ben ik daar milder in geworden ik heb een soort gelatenheid ontwikkeld
2503266 een houding waarbij ons denken spreken en handelen niet wordt bepaald door zelfzuchtige motieven
2503267 als boeddhist voel ik wel verwantschap met een mysticus als eckhardt
2503268 om zich te bezinnen op het leven gaan de christelijke mystici net als de boeddhisten bij zichzelf te rade
2503269 dat streven wij ook na evenwichtigheid van geest vrede met hoe het leven zich ontvouwt
2503270 de boeddha gebruikt de term middenweg dat betekent dat je niets van wat zich aan je voordoet wegduwt of uitsluit maar ook niets negeert
2503271 als je denkt ik mag nergens aan denken ik m et nu rustig zijn bereik je je innerlijke evenwicht niet
2503272 het is als een volumeknopje je stelt het steeds een beetje bij totdat je het juiste niveau hebt gevonden als je de knop te veel naar de ene kant zet ben je te weinig gelaten en erg gedreven te veel naar de andere kant betekent dat je te veel gelatenheid hebt dan word je lui het juiste midden leer ik te vinden door regelmatig op mijn meditatiekussen te gaan zitten
2503273 ze ervaren drukte stress en soms pijn er is die onbestemde vraag er moet toch meer zijn tussen hemel en aarde dan het leven waar ik in zit
2503274 na een eerste kennismaking merken mensen iets van de helende kracht van mindfulness en dat ze daarmee verder kunnen de geest zuiveren daar gaat het om aandacht vertrouwen gelijkmoedigheid zulke positieve krachten kunnen dan naar voren komen
2503275 je leert hier om wat lichter te leven daar kun je je in trainen net zoals je in de sportschool je spieren traint
2503276 praten is niet fout maar om je er niet in te verliezen is zwijgen wel zo gemakkelijk
2503277 bedenk dat mediteren een kwestie is van evenwicht als je een beetje een hypochonder bent een ongemakvermijder probeer deze dagen dan wat strenger voor jezelf te zijn en als je juist heel streng voor jezelf bent probeer dan eens wat eerder te stoppen
2503278 natuurlijk ervaar ik soms nog wanhoop of boosheid maar dat wijs ik niet af
2503279 de pieken en dalen blijven maar daar reageer je steeds gelijkmoediger op dan ervaar je misschien afgunst maar daarbij denk je nou dan is die afgunst er maar
2503280 jezelf een vriendelijke wens toesturen bij velen werkt het goed om dat te laten stromen op de ademhaling bij het inademen zeg je in gedachten moge ik en bij het uitademen bijvoorbeeld vrede ervaren probeer maar in moge ik en uit vrede ervaren
2503281 the only means available that will actually destroy the iranian nuclear project
2503282 t he increasing accessibility of weapons or nuclear materials from which elementary weapons could be constructed and the countless ways by which terrorists could smuggle a weapon across americas borders
2503283 if the u s and other governments keep doing what we are doing now a nuclear terrorist attack is inevitable
2503284 the cleanest safest and most reliable energy source on earth
2503285 the perils of 27 000 nuclear weapons 2 000 of them ready to launch within minutes
2503286 when she wasnt out at nightclubs she was taking acting classes
2503287 we dated for only a few months but in that period i spent a lot of time with her and her friends whose behavior intrigued and appalled me to such an extent that i ended up basing a novel on the experience
2503288 shes an idiot a fool a moron a faux guru but not mean spirited
2503289 there is a pic of her with a supermarket cart where she looks like prince charles wife camilla yikers
2503290 thrown under the bus and backed over a few times
2503291 maar deze levenshouding is psychologisch normaler te noemen dan de lange periode van vooruitgangsgeloof die er in het westen aan vooraf is gegaan
2503292 de dood van deze staatsman herinnert ons eraan dat amerika beroemd is om zijn nostalgie het verlangen naar zijn eigen ouderwetse notie van denken aan de toekomst
2503293 it is a mountain only for the highly experienced climbers
2503294 while at the drum tower in central beijing the two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant
2503295 one of the family members was killed and the other seriously injured following the attack the assailant took his own life
2503296 killed himself by jumping from the second story of the drum tower
2503297 tactical battalions have completely liberated tskhinvali from georgian military forces
2503298 we are actually in the stage of preparing our departure
2503299 whats happening right now in australia has us all very excited
2503300 at the moment opinion polls on ending the monarchy are even higher here than in australia so we believe its just a matter of time before canada sees the same level of debate
2503301 the most despicable appalling anti democratic imperial colonial symbol against which all social and individual rights were obtained through the course of history
2503302 1608 is a historic date for you for quebec and for all of canada
2503303 its not only the 400th anniversary of the founding of quebec city that were celebrating today but it is four centuries of courage of stubbornness of boldness that make it that the french in north america have existed still exist and will still exist in the future
2503304 it depends a lot on how you ask the question
2503305 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2503306 if i asked you to marry me would you say yes
2503307 you and lori are both in my heart so you can never say you didnt go to india together
2503308 but in the past couple weeks i was turning the fastest lap times of my life so thats a pretty good sign
2503309 but nothing could match the absolutely unabated response i had to seeing taylor with the
2503310 it was a tough day of test cricket and tomorrow will be the same

2503693 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2503694 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2503705 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2503706 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2503707 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2503708 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2503709 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2503739 alle sind teil von bauprojekten etwa die pufferzonen im rila nationalpark sowie die k stengebiete in irkali und kaliakra
2503740 die besorgniserregenden berichte aus bulgarien zeigen deutlich was passiert wenn tourismusentwicklung mit einseitiger infrastrukturentwicklung gleichgesetzt wird
2503741 gerade eine region mit so grandiosen natur und kulturlandschaften wie osteuropa h tte alle chancen ihre l ndlichen regionen durch tourismus zu st rken
2503742 politiker die so etwas zulassen egal in welchem staat schaden der zukunft ihres landes
2503743 es braucht daher viel mehr unterst tzung f r umweltaktivisten und initiativen f r eine nachhaltige tourismusentwicklung vor ort
2503744 wer dadurch seine arbeit vernachl ssigt muss damit rechnen dass der chef ihm die k ndigung ausspricht
2503745 einem chauffeur der in seinem bereitschaftsraum darauf wartet dass er gerufen wird kann man ganz sicher nicht unterstellen dass er durch fernsehen seine arbeit vernachl ssigt
2503746 schlie lich sollen sie nach dieser ruhezeit auch noch arbeitsleistungen verrichten
2503747 auch eine verk uferin in einer boutique wird einmal keine kunden haben doch k nnte es f r das gesch ft betriebswirtschaftlich sch digend sein wenn sie l mmelnd in der ecke vorm tv sitzt
2503748 bei all diesen fragen befinden wir uns in einem wechselspiel zwischen grenzen der auslebung der freien pers nlichkeit der arbeitnehmer und den rechten des arbeitgebers
2503749 solange keine kunden oder andere arbeitnehmer gest rt werden hat der arbeitgeber kein recht derart schikan se methoden anzuwenden
2503750 doch der chef sollte so fair sein und seine mitarbeiter ber die konsequenzen derartiger handlungen im vorfeld informieren

2503800 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2503801 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2503802 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2503803 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2503804 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2503805 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2503806 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2503807 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2503810 our family has been through a lot some caused by nature some caused by human weakness and some most recently caused by the desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences
2503811 none of these has been easy but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2503812 she was having some trouble she just wanted to talk
2503813 i wanted her not to tell the public what had happened

2503827 videogames must be capable of rethinking their narration formats and genres they have to be capable of offering alternatives to established genres in the same way as american tv series have done by asserting themselves as an efficient counterweight to the movie industry by taking the economic model of the series with short formats and attractive subjects available at definite dates and times we are aiming at all those who have turned their backs on playing videogames due to lack of time or boredom
2503828 contrary to traditional games the aim is not to reward performance but the capacity to personify a fictional character

2503836 it is not just about footballing ability when you are spending such large sums of money you have to get everything right
2503837 it is about the personality and how they fit into the club he wants to be sure they will not upset things more often than not he gets it spot on
2503838 it will be interesting to see if they have a team

2503845 he said before he led a four member delegation representing the protesters to state their position to the forum organisers he also said
2503846 i have negotiated with the dang wangi police to stop the forum at 9 30am or else we will act
2503847 its unfortunate that we could not carry on with the forum its a real shame we had to stop the forum due to the advice from the police i have great faith in our ability and maturity as malaysians to discuss sensitive issues sensibly i do not subscribe to the view that we cannot talk about sensitive issues not for one minute not today maybe it was the case 30 years ago but not today

2503930 thank you thank you all for all that you do here its all so wonderful
2503931 to me it speaks of the importance of our relations with china
2503932 the reason im going to the olympics is twofold one to show my respect for the people of china and two to cheer on the u s team
2503933 the scale and size of this embassy set on 10 acres in a new diplomatic zone symbolizes the future of the relationship as it expands in scope and breadth
2503934 beyond the final score the politics of sport in asia
2503935 it acknowledges that chinas rise is not a zero sum game thats not denying the competitive aspects to the relationship but it is a broader template which coincides with the building of the new embassy
2503936 but there is no peace and democracy in burma and its impossible to go home
2503937 the noble cause has many devoted champions and i happen to be married to one of them
2503938 thats a really good question and we have talked to the chinese quite often about this
2503939 as you know the chinese depend on a lot of energy imports into china we urge the chinese to do what other countries have done to sanction to put a financial squeeze on the burmese generals
2503940 the loss of our blue sky must be regarded as a loss of our human rights
2503941 the fog you see is based on the basis of humidity and heat it does not mean to say that this fog is the same as pollution it can be pollution but the fog doesnt mean necessarily that it is pollution
2503942 the uacs goal in this project is to raise awareness because most people have no idea what sharia law is
2503943 we are confident people will see the billboard and learn on their own what sharia law is and come to their own conclusions at the very least we hope our billboard will spark public debate on this overlooked issue
2503944 under sharia law if you are accused of stealing a hand and foot from opposite sides are amputated if you are caught having an affair the woman is stoned to death and the man is given 80 lashes if you change religions you can be charged under apostasy laws and given the death sentence by a legal sharia court if you want to marry a nine year old child sharia law condones pedophilia because mohammad married aisha at six and consummated the marriage at age nine i find these and many more practices of sharia law despicable and hateful
2503945 if a person condones the horrors of sharia law enforcement then living under our u s constitution and bill of rights is not possible
2503946 discussing everything you will never hear from the mainstream press
2503947 sharia is the glue that holds an islamic society together
2503948 the harsh punishments associated with sharia law in all facets of day to day life create a never ending atmosphere of abject fear for those living under sharia law
2503949 for those people calling me hateful then they would have to condone child marriages amputations for stealing and death for apostates to name only a few punishments attached to sharia law if my critics condone this type of activity under any circumstances then it is they who are hateful towards anyone who is non muslim and should look into their own mirror before crying hate speech

2503969 il principato non ha mai cessato di esistere mai entrato a far parte del regno ditalia e quindi neanche della repubblica considerando soprattutto che il diritto internazionale non ammette lusucapione
2503970 noi non riconosceremo lindipendenza unilaterale proclamata dal parlamento di pristina perch non rispetta il diritto internazionale
2503971 penso che la verit sia che se la scozia proponesse davvero un referendum per lindipendenza ci troveremmo in una situazione di enorme incertezza e instabilit non posso credere che qualcuno lo voglia anche solo la prospettiva di una cosa del genere danneggerebbe la fiducia delleconomia sarebbe da pazzi escludere la scozia dal regno unito
2503972 anche se tutto il mondo riconosce il kosovo la russia non ci sosterr noi siamo una moneta di scambio nelle sue mani per far pressione sulla georgia e sulla comunit internazionale nel momento in cui la georgia inizier le trattative con la nato la russia cercher con varie misure di trattenerla dallentrata nellalleanza atlantica promettendo in cambio noi e labkhazia
2503973 langoscia scaturisce dal desiderio che la vita sia altro rispetto a ci che
2503974 you got to come with a little extra to satisfy them
2503975 when i started in comedy in the clubs in 1977 blacks couldnt do certain clubs not because they were segregated they just didnt want to put the black comics out there in los angeles the clubs would have a black night people would say why dont you come by and do something i would say im a comedian dont put a title on me dont limit yourself how you start is how you finish

2503979 i like challenges i know there will be challenges and i look forward to rising to the occasion
2503980 i would have loved for it to be less dramatic but im thankful for the athens experience
2503981 physically mentally and emotionally im better from going through four years of international competition
2503982 you like to win the first game they feel pretty good and we did that
2503983 but they cant feel real great because they made a number of errors that we can coach to but thats kind of what you want in a first game win the game but also correct some things in some meetings
2503984 t was all of a sudden today that i beagan to ask myself
2503985 dad i found in the bible where is says we are saved by faith alone
2503986 yes and how did we miss that all those years
2503987 grazie marta hai capito il mio scopo ti voglio bene

2503989 investors often lose sight of longer term historical investment results especially during short term periods of extreme volatility and trending markets
2503990 im sick of carrot sticks and broccoli florets as snacks
2503991 it was a hamstring strain the degree we do not know
2503992 were monitoring as we go our thought process is to just be very cautious and just move forward day to day i dont see why he wouldnt be ready for the opener aug 30 at oregon but again its too early were just getting our first looks at it
2503993 i saw the injury when it happened and obviously everyones body responds a little bit different so his bodys response will be different from other guys but one thing that i do think and believe is that hes a pretty quick healer
2503994 i kept on a read zone right around the outside and went to turn up and just couldnt do what i normally did
2503995 i didnt go down i just did a little hop and skip and they came to check me out and put a little ice on it
2503996 a disproportionate number of stocks that underperform the market by a dramatic margin
2503997 out of all the things i have been taught at auburn for the past four years they still never taught us how to say goodbye
2503998 tony scholes is over in spain speaking to the player at the moment but that doesnt mean he will be signing for us
2503999 he barry is english and can play three different positions but i am talking about someone who can play on the left
2504000 we have a good player alonso and we have another good player coming in soon
2504001 we can improve the squad so we will try to do that we will bring in one more player if we can
2504002 i do not know when but clearly we have problems on the left harry kewell has gone fabio aurelio is injured and sebastien leto cannot get a work permit
2504003 who comes in it could be another left sided player rather than a central midfielder
2504004 it became evident that a community of terrific writers existed
2504005 executive privilege claims that form the foundation of the executives resistance to the committees subpoenas are not foreign to federal courts either
2504006 in the thirty four years since united states v nixon was decided the courts have routinely considered questions of executive privilege or immunity
2504007 is not merely an investigation into the executives use of his removal power but rather a broader inquiry into whether improper partisan considerations have influenced prosecutorial discretion
2504008 defies both reason and precedent to say as the executive does that the committee which is charged with oversight of doj generally cannot permissibly employ its investigative resources on this subject
2504009 unique ability to address improper partisan influence in the prosecutorial process n o other institution will fill the vacuum if congress is unable to investigate and respond to this evil
2504010 the 110th congress expires on january 3 2009 unlike the senate the house is not a continuing body
2504011 i was brought up to believe that cheaters never prosper
2504012 i used to think the olympics had the best drug testing but its a big fa ade
2504013 you can skirt the rules on hormones theres no test for human growth hormone theres an improved test for epo which increases oxygen in the blood but it wont be ready for the olympics
2504014 i dont want to be one of those conspiracy theory guys but there are a lot of people juicing
2504015 youre never going to have a 100 percent clean olympics its sad kids look up to these people
2504016 without a revolutionary theory there cannot be a revolutionary movement
2504017 ive experienced a lot in my 16 year career and i have to say friday night was probably the greatest night ive had professionally
2504018 first to be around all the other american athletes to start the night youre obviously very inspired by all of them and then we were surprised by president bush sr and jr coming to address all of us and meet every athlete personally regardless of anybodys philosophy we still have a tremendous amount of respect for our leaders and that was extremely cool
2504019 physically doubles is the better choice for me at this time
2504020 for 14 or 15 months it has been my whole goal to be here in beijing and to be able to compete
2504021 so of course theres disappointment but i knew coming here there was a little bit of a chance that might happen
2504022 some of us are sharing rooms at the village and were having a good time
2504023 liezel and i are sharing a bathroom with james and sam bob and mike have the master suite
2504024 lindsay asked me the other day liezel would you consider doing it
2504025 with the players that had pulled out there were a lot of last minute changes and with the time difference to the states a lot of paperwork wasnt getting received until 15 hours later finally it all came together on wednesday afternoon
2504026 theres so much fighting in the world and yet when the olympics come around its amazing its just a great atmosphere
2504027 my goal this year has been to keep getting better
2504028 i feel like when i focus on that it helps me substantially more than when im out there trying to win and getting worried about winning or losing it helps me be more free on the court which has been a real positive
2504029 over the past five or six years i definitely appreciate more the travel we get to do and the places we go see
2504030 i make a point of going out and seeing things you have to mentally too because it helps break up the day to get your mind off tennis
2504031 ive learned to appreciate the type of lifestyle i have
2504032 without a revolutionary theory there cannot be a revolutionary movement

2504034 la creencia de que todos ser n salvos muchos grupos ense an la doctrina del universalismo desde diferentes perspectivas algunos protestantes y cat licos liberales intentan basarlo en la escritura notando que cristo muri por todos y que el castigo eterno es incoherente con un dios de amor y misericordia que desea que todos sean salvos
2504035 y yo jes s si fuere levantado de la tierra a atraer a mi mismo
2504036 as qu como por la transgresi n de uno vino la condenaci n a todos los hombres de la misma manera por la justicia de uno vino a los hombres la justificaci n de vida
2504037 porque el amor de cristo nos constri e pensando esto que si uno muri por luego todos murieron

2504046 the top reason a woman finds herself in a rap video sprawled undressed over a luxury car while a rapper is saying lewd things about her is a lack of self esteem i know it sounds like a clich but no one who values loves or knows herself would allow herself to be placed in such a degrading position
2504047 i think queensland can meet the challenge i think you will see employers not hiring as many people but also not letting staff go
2504048 with a greater proportion of the family budget needed to cover basics many families look set to cut back on areas of discretionary spending
2504049 this could deliver a major blow to queenslands entertainment and holiday industries
2504050 the poll confirms that few families have been spared from the economic downturn

2504130 less than 10 percent of the property has been reclaimed
2504131 but we are not convinced all the victims in the case know that all this property has been recovered
2504132 we are talking about property from a large geographical area
2504133 we have several pieces of equipment marked with someones name or initials that has not been claimed

2504141 if you see a nesting female remain at a respectful distance they have a finite window they can nest so it is important not to disturb her and allow her make her nest
2504142 each nest has approximately 120 eggs in it and well see somewhere around an 80 percent hatch rate when you put all the data together
2504143 since we had a hot beginning to the summer and some brunswick county beaches had hatches its time

2504194 maria louise and paul were the genuine article for two years his modelling career meant he was going all over the world and maria louise was busy with her job doing make up on big films and for victoria they split up on really good terms and remain friends they still have a lot of shared pals
2504195 the last time maria louise was over she went for dinner with paul and they had a great laugh he was coy about his new woman and she couldnt believe her eyes when she found out it was jennifer
2504196 what it really took is someone who understood the heritage who loved it someone who wasnt afraid of it
2504197 the only way this was going to work is if we can take the mickey out of ourselves so to speak so we can look back at who we are and be able to laugh
2504198 as an actress you express emotion with your face and if you have plastic surgery you lose that spark im not going to say never for sure though
2504199 i dont know if for example having babies will stretch my stomach beyond what is acceptable
2504200 people usually look better without surgery my grandmother aged very gracefully
2504201 i love kate winslet she has a beautiful body as does monica bellucci beyonce jennifer lopez jessica biel scarlett johansson there are so many gorgeous girls out there
2504202 it is a wise father that knows his own child
2504203 the images seem really beautiful but the tvs are really expensive something like jpy200 000 or jpy300 000 yen i really dont want to spend that much money to watch tv
2504204 when terrestrial tv goes digital it will be able to work together with the internet to offer various it applications including e government e municipal government and e commerce
2504205 the third action plan for the promotion of digital broadcasting
2504206 radio frequencies are a resource but they are extremely limited
2504207 we are trying to raise the efficiency of their use as fast as possible
2504208 these frequencies are being used all over the place you have mobile phones tv and radio broadcasts additionally there are emergency communications and satellites but if you have analog and digital together its not a very efficient arrangement so its necessary that we stop the analog signals to get the most use out of the airwaves
2504209 i just dont think the plan in its current form will work
2504210 in a year about 10 million tv sets are shipped in japan and there are at least 100 million tv sets in the country
2504211 the period from december 2003 to the 2011 deadline is less than eight years but in an eight year period only about 80 million sets can be produced so there wont be enough digitally compliant tvs available there simply isnt time to produce them all
2504212 its a great car its well built safe and fast the best but only a limited number of people can have one so they settle for a corolla
2504213 with lots of regular people like the elderly living in the countryside children youths and housewives they dont really need the kind of high quality images digital tvs produce
2504214 so a lot of viewers dont really want all their tvs to be large for the kitchen for example a small tv is ideal
2504215 right now you get a small tv for as cheap as jpy10 000 but people with those will then have to be forced to get tuners costing jpy50 000 or more theyre going to hate doing that
2504216 the sets being sold right now are all bs and cs communications satellite as well as terrestrial digital they all have big screens of 30 inches and more even the cathode ray tube type costs about jpy300 000 with other sets going up to jpy600 000 and jpy700 000 but were only talking about the most expensive ones
2504217 when more and more digital tvs come onto the market many will be of the type that just handles the terrestrial digital broadcasts plus ones having small screens that will bring down prices
2504218 right now digital tvs number only in the thousands but once they get into the tens and hundreds of thousands theyll get cheaper
2504219 nuestro modo de vida requiere que seamos hombres crucificados al mundo para los que el mundo est crucificado hombres nuevos despojados de sus propios afectos para revestirse de cristo muertos a s mismos y vivos para la justicia que en palabras de pablo demos prueba de que somos servidores de dios en fatigas desvelos ayunos pureza ciencia paciencia bondad en el esp ritu santo en caridad sincera llevando el mensaje de la verdad y mediante las armas de la justicia las de la derecha y las de la izquierda en gloria e ignominia en calumnias y en buena fama en la adversidad y prosperidad caminemos a grandes pasos hacia la patria celestial

2504243 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2504244 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2504245 tskhinvali is now under the complete control of our troops
2504246 today we have hit four russian fighter jets we have now hit 10 in total and captured a pilot
2504247 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2504248 i was in the hospital yesterday where i saw many civilian wounded the hospital was later destroyed by a georgian jet i dont know whether the wounded were still there
2504249 our peacekeepers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2504250 they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now
2504251 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2504252 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2504253 in terms of politics i do believe that doing anything now is not tenable
2504254 that means actively campaigning for barack obama or having a role at the convention hed be a huge distraction

2504259 there are two problems here one is personal and he and his family will have to work that out and the other is that he apparently lied repeatedly about this
2504260 its tragic for elizabeth and the kids as a serious political candidate it would be very hard for him to be that again or to have a major job in government the lying is a big part of that
2504261 my observation was that he seemed very sincere it never ceases to amaze me how often this happens
2504262 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let him down

2504291 all i know is that i wanted to be in the middle lane of the pool tomorrow
2504292 i will have to go back and talk to my coach and go back to the drawing board
2504293 i think it was just one of those days everything was going great up until i got in i got in the water and nothing happened i did the first two strokes and it didnt feel right

2504298 you come here dreaming of swimming fast in the olympics and thats what i did today i knew it was going to take a massive step up to make the final
2504299 i knew it was going to take 3 45 and i thought i was in the shape to do that but they pulled away from me at the end i cant be unsatisfied with the way i swam i was puking my way up the pool so i think that shows i was giving 100
2504300 i had a terrible start i need to get in there and get going tomorrow

2504321 we havent seen indications or any concrete evidence that iran is building a nuclear weapon and ive been saying that consistently for the last five years
2504322 verification and enforcement of the non proliferation objectives contained in the npt are limited in part to maintain the balance of rights and obligations of states parties npt safeguards administered by the international atomic energy agency iaea are limited to verifying that no nuclear material in each non weapon state has been diverted to weapons or unknown use these safeguards allow for the iaea to report a case of non compliance to the security council only if nuclear material is found to have been diverted
2504323 under a traditional view the authority of the security council is limited to cases which have been found to constitute a threat to international peace and security
2504324 threat to peace breach of peace or act of aggression
2504325 it calls into question the legitimacy of the security council in intruding on matters of enforcing treaty law on matters that do not rise to the level of threat to the peace
2504326 israel will attack iran if it doesnt abandon its nuclear program
2504327 if there wont be a choice other than a nuclear iran or a military option its clear what our decision has to be
2504328 there is no military political or moral justification to initiate war with iran
2504329 all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations
2504330 war is essentially an evil thing its consequences are not confined to the belligerent states alone but affect the whole world to initiate a war of aggression therefore is not only an international crime it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole

2504344 she used to be a real party girl when she wasnt out at nightclubs she was taking acting classes we dated for only a few months but in that period i spent a lot of time with her and her friends whose behavior intrigued and appalled me to such an extent that i ended up basing a novel on the experience it was narrated in the first person from the point of view of an ostensibly jaded sexually voracious 20 year old who was inspired by lisa i certainly thought of alison poole as a sympathetic and ultimately endearing character

2504346 nasehat itu merupakan kewajiban manusia semuanya sebagaimana telah kami sebutkan sebelum ini tetapi dalam teknik penyampaiannya haruslah dengan cara rahasia tidak boleh tidak karena barangsiapa yang menasehati saudaranya dihadapan orang lain maka berarti dia telah mencelanya dan barangsiapa yang menasehatinya secara rahasia maka dia telah memperbaikinya sesungguhnya menyampaikan dengan penuh perhatian kepada saudaranya sesama muslim adalah kritik yang membangun lebih besar kemungkinannya untuk diterima dibandingkan menyampaikan dengan maksud mencelanya
2504347 saya berkata kepada misar apakah engkau suka apabila ada orang lain memberitahumu tentang kekurangan kekuranganmu maka ia berkata apabila yang datang adalah orang yang memberitahukan kekurangan kekuranganku dengan cara menjelek jelekkanku maka saya tidak senang tapi apabila yang datang kepadaku adalah seorang pemberi nasehat maka saya senang
2504348 talhah datang menemui abdul jabbar bin wail dan di situ banyak terdapat orang maka ia berbicara dengan abdul jabbar menyampaikan sesuatu dengan rahasia kemudian setelah itu beliau pergi maka abdul jabbar bin wail berkata apakah kalian tahu apa yang ia katakan tadi kepadaku ia berkata saya melihatmu ketika engkau sendang shalat kemarin sempat melirik ke arah lain
2504349 nasehat apabila dilaksanakan seperti apa yang telah kami sebutkan akan melanggengkan kasih sayang dan menyebabkan terealisasinya ukhuwah
2504350 maka wajib atas seseorang untuk selalu memberi nasehat baik yang diberi nasehat itu suka ataupun benci tersinggung atau tidak tersinggung apabila engkau memberi nasehat maka nasehatilah secara rahasia jangan dihadapan orang lain dan cukup dengan memberi isyarat tanpa terus terang secara langsung kecuali apabila orang yang dinasehati tidak memahami isyaratmu maka harus secara terus terang janganlah engkau menasehati orang lain dengan syarat nasehatmu harus diterima apabila engkau melampaui adab adab tadi maka engkau yang dzalim bukan pemberi nasehat dan gila ketaatan serta gila kekuasaan bukan pemberi amanat dan pelaksana hak ukuwah ini yakni memberi nasehat dengan syarat harus diterima bukanlah termasuk hukum akal dan hukum persahabatan melainkan hukum rimba bagaikan seorang penguasa dengan rakyatnya dan tuan dengan hamba sahayanya
2504351 al fudhail wafat tahun 187h berkata seorang mukmin menutup aib saudaranya dan menasehatinya sedangkan seorang fajir pelaku maksiat membocorkan aib saudaranya dan memburuk burukkannya
2504352 sesungguhnya orang orang yang ingin agar berita perbuatan yang keji itu tersiar dikalangan orang orang yang beriman bagi mereka adzab yang pedih di dunia dan akhirat dan alleh mengetahui sedangkan kalian tidak mengetahui
2504353 perlu diketahui bahwa nasehat itu adalah pembicaraan yang dilakukan secara rahasia antaramu dengannya karena apabila engkau menasehatinya secara rahasia dengan empat mata maka sangat membekas pada dirinya dan dia tahu bahwa engkau pemberi nasehat tetapi apabila engkau bicarakan dia dihadapan orang banyak maka besar kemungkinan bangkit kesombongannya yang menyebabkan ia berbuat dosa dengan tidak menerima nasehat dan mungkin pula ia menyangka bahwa engkau hanya ingin balas dendam dan mendeskreditkannya serta untuk menjatuhkan kedudukannya di mata manusia sehingga ia tidak menerima isi nasehat tersebut tetapi apabila dilakukan secara rahasia antara kamu dan dia berdua maka nasehatmu itu amat berarti bagi dia dan dia akan menerimanya darimu
2504354 umat islam mereka itu memiliki kehormatan dan harga diri oleh karena itu haruslah kita menjaga hak hak dan kehormatan mereka haruslah kita memelihara perasaan mereka tetapi kadang kadang sesuatu nasehat yang akan engkau sampaikan kepada orang lain apabila engkau tunda maka akan terlambat maka harus sekarang juga engkau menasehatinya sebelum terlambat
2504355 sangat disayangkan sekali ketika saya mendengar tentang orang orang yang termasuk memiliki kesungguhan dalam mencari dan menerima kebenaran akan tetapi mereka berpecah belah masing masing di antara mereka memiliki nama dan sifat tertentu
2504356 sesungguhnya orang orang yang memecah belah agamanya dan mereka terpecah menjadi beberapa golongan tidak ada sedikitpun tanggung jawabmu terhadap mereka sesungguhnya urusan mereka hanyalah terserah kepada allah kemudian allah akan memberitahukan kepada mereka apa yang telah mereka perbuat
2504357 dia telah mensyaratkan bagi kalian tentang dien yang telah diwasiatkan kepada nuh dan apa yang telah kami wahyukan kepadamu dan apa yang telah kami wasiatkan kepada ibrahim musa dan isa yaitu tegakkanlah dien dan janganlah kalian berpecah belah tentangnya
2504358 ketahuilah bahwasanya ghibah diperbolehkan untuk tujuan yang benar dan syari di mana tidak mungkin sampai kepada tujuan tersebut kecuali dengan cara berghibah yang demikian itu disebabkan enam perkara
2504359 izinkanlah dia untuk masuk ia sejahat jahat orang di tengah kaumnya
2504360 adapun muawiyah dia seorang faqir tidak memiliki harta sedangkan abul jahm tongkatnya tidak pernah lepas dari bahunya
2504361 al imam asy syaukani rahimahullah telah mengulas ucapan imam nawawi tentang enam point dari hal hal yang diperbolehkan untuk berghibah pent dalam suatu risalah yang beliau beri nama rafur raibah ammaa yajuzu wa maa laa yajuzu minal ghibah dan sekarang ini saya menyebutkan apa apa yang nampak olehku sisi kebenaran dalamnya
2504362 dan saya berkata dengan memohon pertolongan allah dan bertawakal kepadanya sebelum berbicara mengenai bentuk bentuk yang ada ini ketahuilah bahwa kami telah mengemukakan bahwa pengharaman ghibah terdapat dengan jelas dalam as sunnah dan ijma dan konteks yang terdapat dalam al quran dan as sunnah secara umum dan menyeluruh mempunyai konsekuensi pengharaman ghibah dari setiap individu dari pribadi pribadi kaum muslimin kepada setiap individu dari mereka pula maka tidak boleh ada pendapat yang menghalalkan ghibah dalam tempat tertentu bagi pribadi atau masyarakat kecuali dengan membawa dalil yang mengkhususkan keumuman pengharaman ini apabila dalil tersebut telah tegak atas yang demikian maka itulah yang diharapkan dan apabila tidak didapati dalil maka itu berarti berdusta atas nama allah dan termasuk menghalalkan apa apa yang allah haramkan tanpa keterangan dari allah
2504363 apa yang disebutkan oleh asy syaukani merupakan kriteria yang penting di mana ia memberikan rambu rambu yang agung di antaranya
2504364 mengutamakan maslahat yang jelas adanya atas mafsadah yang belum tentu muncul
2504365 saya berkata apabila nasehat itu dilontarkan secara global sudah mencapai sasaran dan terang maksudnya maka cukup dengan global dan hal itu merupakan suatu kenikmatan tetapi kalau tidak cukup dengan global maka tidak ada jalan lain bagi dia kecuali harus dengan menyebutkan orangnya tetapi harus ada batasannya tidak boleh seenaknya dengan leluasa sehingga keluar batas dalam berbicara karena berlebih lebihan dalam berbicara itu merupakan batu sandungan yang membuat ia terjatuh
2504366 perkara perkara yang disangka bukan ghibah tetapi sebenarnya termasuk ghibah
2504367 dan barangkali allah memberi keutamaan kepada seseorang dalam hal amar maruf nahi munkar di mana tidak sembarang orang dapat menasehati orang lain lebih lebih kalau orang yang dinasehati tersebut sulit untuk menerima nasehat kemudian orang tersebut menerima nasehatnya dengan jujur dan ikhlas dan nampak dari dia keinginan yang kuat untuk bertaubat akan tetapi si penasehat tersebut nampaknya lemah dalam menghadapi syetan tiba tiba ia menceritakan aib orang tersebut di hadapan manusia
2504368 dan perbedaan antara nasehat dan ghibah adalah bahwa nasehat itu bermaksud dalam rangka memberi peringatan kepada seorang muslim dari bahayanya ahli bidah penyebar fitnah penipu atau perusak
2504369 maka apabila menceritakan kejelekan orang lain dalam rangka nasehat yang diwajibkan oleh allah dan rasulnya kepada hamba hambanya kaum muslimin maka hal yang demikian adalah taqarub kepada allah termasuk amal kebaikan tetapi apabila menceritakan kejelekan orang lain bermaksud mencela saudaramu dan menodai kehormatan dan memakan dagingnya agar engkau menyia nyiakan kedudukan dia di hati hati manusia maka maksiat tersebut merupakan penyakit yang kronis dan api yang melalap kebaikan sebagaimana api yang membakar kayu bakar
2504370 menyebutkan kejelekan manusia dengan apa apa yang tidak disukai oleh mereka pada asalnya ada dua macam
2504371 apabila tujuannya adalah mengajak kepada kebaikan dan menganjurkannya serta melarang keburukan dan memperingatkan darinya maka harus menyebutkan keburukan perbuatan tersebut
2504372 mengapakah orang orang memberikan syarat syarat yang tidak ada pada kitab allah
2504373 mengapakah orang orang meninggalkan hal hal yang aku perbolehkan demi allah sesungguhnya aku orang yang paling bertaqwa kepada allah dan yang paling tahu akan batasan batasannya di antara kalian
2504374 yang kedua sedangkan menyebutkan keburukan orang lain sekaligus menyebutkan orangnya dapat dilakukan dalam beberapa kejadian tertentu
2504375 wahai rasulullah sesungguhnya abu sufyan seorang yang pelit ia tidak memberikan kecukupan nafkah kepadaku dan anakku kecuali saya mengambil harta darinya tanpa sepengetahuan dia maka baru mencukupi kami
2504376 dan di antaranya dalam rangka memberi nasehat kepada kaum muslimin dalam urusan dien dan dunia mereka sebagaimana dalam hadits yang shahih dari fatimah binti qais ketika dia bermusyawarah dengan nabi shalallahu alaihi wasallam tentang siapa yang akan dinikahinya ia berkata
2504377 adapun muawiyah dia orang yang faqir tidak memiliki harta sedangkan abu jahm ia seorang yang suka memukuli wanita
2504378 h r bukhari dalam kitab 7301 dari aisyah dengan lafadz yang mendekati
2504379 h r bukhari dalam kitab an nikah 5062 dan h r muslim dalam kitab an nikah 1401 5
2504380 kepada allah kepada kitab nya kepada rasul nya dan kepada para penguasa kaum muslimin serta kepada kaum muslimin pada umumnya
2504381 saya bertanya kepada malik dan ats tsaury dan al laits bin saad saya kira dia dan al auzai mengenai seseorang yang tertuduh dalam hadits atau tidak hafal mereka semuanya berkata jelaskan keadaannya
2504382 sesungguhnya berat bagi saya untuk mengatakan si fulan begini dan si fulan begitu
2504383 apabila engkau diam dan saya diam maka kapan orang yang jahil mengetahui dan dapat membedakan yang shahih dan bercacat
2504384 mana yang lebih engkau cintai seseorang yang puasa dan shalat serta beritikaf ataukah orang yang membantah ahli bidah

2504403 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2504404 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2504405 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2504406 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2504407 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2504408 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2504409 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2504410 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2504760 in this apologia for christian faith keller mines material from literary classics philosophy anthropology and a multitude of other disciplines to make an intellectually compelling case for god written for skeptics and the believers who love them the book draws on the authors encounters as founding pastor of new yorks booming redeemer presbyterian church one of kellers most provocative arguments is that all doubts however skeptical and cynical they may seem are really a set of alternate beliefs drawing on sources as diverse as 19th century author robert louis stevenson and contemporary new testament theologian n t wright keller attempts to deconstruct everyone he finds in his way from the evolutionary psychologist richard dawkins to popular author dan brown the first shorter part of the book looks at popular arguments against gods existence while the second builds on general arguments for god to culminate in a sharp focus on the redemptive work of god in christ kellers condensed summaries of arguments for and against theism make the scope of the book overwhelming at times nonetheless it should serve both as testimony to the authors encyclopedic learning and as a compelling overview of the current debate on faith for those who doubt and for those who want to re evaluate what they believe and why

2504765 how does a father instill these qualities in his son by raising a modern day knight beginning with a biblical perspective of manhood author pastor robert lewis shares a unique approach to shaping a boy into a man by equipping him with three essential elements a vision a code of conduct and a cause christianity in which to invest his life complete with ceremony ideas to celebrate accomplishments and ingrain them in his mind this softcover is as insightful as it is practical in raising a boy to be a chivalrous godly man

2504825 number one whenever we define a previable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a child a 9 month old child that was delivered to term i mean it it would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute for that purpose i think it would probably be found unconstitutional

2504834 cultural differences may actually have a positive effect on aspects of the socio cultural integration process such as the cultural sensitivity and tolerance exhibited by the acquiring firm managers
2504835 organisational cultural differences were generally found to have a negative impact in domestic settings

2504900 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

2504903 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2504904 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2504905 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2504906 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2504907 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2504908 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2504909 we are fixing that now i am very hopeful and confident this will be settled soonest

2504921 i told my small team before the race to follow the big countries
2504922 i had no choice i just had to try and follow i took a risk at the end by attacking at the end and it turned out to be the good choice otherwise i wouldnt have the bronze medal

2504936 the dialogue demonstrates that we share a common heritage and it is in our best interests to preserve that heritage and build on it

2504993 this is one of the first studies to report that children with certain genetic backgrounds are even more susceptible to asthma than if they lived near major roads and did not carry the variations
2504994 we are working to understand how traffic related exposures may interact with these genes leading to
2504995 this finding demonstrates the critical role of gene environment interaction in determining disease susceptibility
2504996 the investigators at usc have identified key genetic variations in biological pathways related to pah metabolism that are associated with the occurrence of approximately 12 percent of children in the study carried both of the variations and three percent were in the highest risk group based on where they lived however there are a number of genes that could be linked with asthmatic child move further from busy streets the child will definitely have fewer symptoms
2504997 all that can be said at this moment is that data from this and other studies show strong evidence that living near heavy traffic increases

2504999 it is becoming critical to understand the precise structural basis of resistance and even more important to do something about it
2505000 about half of current target the ribosome and most of them target the large subunit
2505001 so such advances have the potential for significant clinical impact the general strategy of rib x to overcome resistance is to create new hybrid that possess the ability to bind to interact simultaneously with different nearby sites on the ribosome represented by different classes of

2505003 the city council should open talks immediately with the chichester diocese and local housing associations to see what can be done with st peters and the other churches that are threatened with closure because of falling attendances
2505004 we asked for this three years ago but our pleas fell on stony ground conversions already carried out in the city show what can be achieved among them st wilfrids in elm grove off lewes road which is a listed art deco building that has been converted into flats
2505005 by selling some of the churches to housing associations the diocese could raise money to carry out work to st peters which is a grade two listed building and one of the citys treasures
2505006 church based housing associations have done this in other communities
2505007 theres every reason why it should be done in our city which faces an acute housing shortage and where every additional home can make a difference

2505012 they blame the drunks who swear and falter and steal brass crosses off the altar but dont condemn the fine church bosses who steal the churches from the crosses
2505013 this new period will be properly publicised and will be open to everyone who has an interest ordinary members of the congregation and people outside the church will have a real say
2505014 it is vitally important that when the period of consultation begins probably in the next month or so we all take the opportunity to put our point of view across
2505015 the church commissioners have the power to reverse the dioceses decision we believe there is a real chance that they will do so when they realise the strength of feeling about the closure we think they will realise how important this church is to the city
2505016 church spires are the great punctuation points of our english countryside but the religious buildings of this country not only tell us where we are geographically they tell us where weve come from
2505017 if i was backed against a wall it is st leonards i would have to close as a place of worship
2505018 although its nice to have these splendid buildings you cant say they matter more than the people
2505019 no great reason why central government should bail us out
2505020 is there a god i personally believe there is i believe in good and evil and i am on the good side
2505021 i have a hard time believing that god would expect me to believe a bunch of ancient ramblings this is 2008 unlike the people who wrote the bible we know the world is round what gravity is that dinosaurs once ruled our planet etc etc the utter lack of education of people that long ago is what pushes me away from the book
2505022 fenugreek for example used as a supplement may affect blood sugar levels but patients are already on other blood sugar lowering medications as well
2505023 people will tell their alternative practitioners that they are using western medicines but the vast majority will not discuss their alternative therapies with a doctor or other healthcare professional
2505024 the evidence is that patients are using these products and may even reduce their conventional medicine doses and modify the timing of doses so they arent taking both together
2505025 while it might be impossible for western medicine to learn all about complementary and alternative therapies healthcare professionals do need to be included in discussions about them so we can document their use and be aware of any potential problems for our patients
2505026 antihistamines cannot be recommended as empirical therapy for children with chronic cough very young children are particularly vulnerable to the adverse events
2505027 there is a surprising lack of high quality evidence in this area given that millions of children around the world have chronic coughs each year
2505028 what we need are well designed randomised controlled trials of anti histamines that are designed so that neither the child nor carers know which
2505029 i have a 7 45 appointment to have the 20 000 mile service done on my van
2505030 whats fascinating about this study is that you would not expect to find contagious yawning where you did not have self awareness
2505031 im disappointed yes because i believe the evidence supported a conviction of at least one of the counts of murder
2505032 until shannon edmonds is held accountable for his actions we dont have justice
2505033 im getting a sense of justice compared with what happened in the past
2505034 fame is simply an imbalance between inbound and outbound attention more inbound arrows than outbound
2505035 i couldnt believe it i had a headache this morning i felt so terrible that i didnt know how id shoot so to win the first gold medal of this olympics is pretty amazing
2505036 wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2505037 we have to focus on our own performance and this helps me to relax and not come under pressure
2505038 my biggest fear was whether wed be able to control the race as a team and in such humid and tremendous heat but we raced to perfection
2505039 im used as cannon fodder they said send the old bugger out there first and see what happens
2505040 it would be stupid for me to take a banned substance just before the games
2505041 my biggest fear was whether wed be able to control the race as a team and in such humid and tremendous heat but we raced to perfection
2505042 i knew on the last lap that my chance had gone
2505043 i got stuck behind watching valverde im disappointed but i cant complain the race was very tough
2505044 i told my small team before the race to follow the big countries
2505045 i had no choice i just had to try and follow i took a risk at the end by attacking at the end and it turned out to be the good choice otherwise i wouldnt have the bronze medal
2505046 today the strongest rider was samuel but ive got the silver medal and thats like a prize in itself
2505047 im disappointed but still happy to have been there in the end
2505048 the olympics to me is a benchmark for how fast weve gone with technology
2505049 thirty months ago no one was talking about youtube now its a verb
2505050 if the question is is this a big issue the answer is not yet
2505051 right now people can go on the internet to watch but not enough will because its not the same experience
2505052 people love tv and still like to get entertainment that way
2505053 and im sure it will be better on tv but to watch that flame go up at the same time as the rest of the world was a beautiful moving thing
2505054 the idea of watching a 14 hour delay is repulsive
2505055 we have a billion dollars worth of revenue at stake here so that means were not public television for better or worse
2505056 men do not make laws they do but discover them laws must be justified by something more than the will of the majority they must rest on the eternal foundation of righteousness that state is most fortunate in its form of government which has the aptest instruments for the discovery of law
2505057 america has spoken candidly and consistently about our concerns over the chinese governments behavior
2505058 we have made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2505059 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2505060 they are the people who will make china a great nation in the 21st century

2505085 the aims of a great empire and the moral health of the people are incompatible holding on to a great empire means to contribute to the extinction of our own people
2505086 take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is

2505088 like an episode of challenge anneka we went to the south african equivalent of b amp q toys r us and sainsburys and using plenty of chutzpah got most of what we needed for free
2505089 that day the children feasted on chicken enjoyed playing with a host of new toys and were given toothbrushes and taught how to use them we planted a vegetable patch built a see saw and shelter and brightened up the place with lion king characters
2505090 when we arrived at the barren patch of land that currently constitutes the orphanage we were greeted by a large group of gorgeous excited kids who were curious and playful we were so energised by them we barely noticed the women lying on the floor a little further on she was a young girl dying of aids who had come to sizabantwana to hand over her child it really hit home that this project effectively serves as surrogate parents for all these kids and that without it like millions of others in south africa they would simply be alone
2505091 hygiene and nutrition are both massively important in the developing world

2505093 about how the courts in californian were trying to outlaw home schooling well good news yesterday friday
2505094 the court acknowledged that a state prohibition on home schooling would intrude on parents constitutional right to direct their childrens education and that that any limit on that right would be presumed unconstitutional
2505095 were very thrilled not just a little bit and were surprised as well to get a court to do a 180 degree reversal is a remarkable thing and we view it as a blessing from god were really thankful for it and theres hundreds of thousands of home school kids in california who are now able to breathe a sigh of relief
2505096 you want tuk tuk no tomorrow i take you around tomorrow all day

2505098 we thought it best at the time to protect the organizations as well as to get the funds back into the organization to deal with it in house it was a judgment call at the time and looking back people can agree or disagree with it but we did what we thought was right
2505099 clearly this was an uncomfortable conflicting and humiliating situation as far as my family and i were concerned
2505100 and so the real decisions on how to handle it had to be made by others

2505112 i can count the number of days on one hand where youre sweating already before the race even starts
2505113 we had ice packs on our backs already and that never happens
2505114 i dont know whether thats got anything to do with it

2505117 when you think of cancer you know its a terrible disease
2505118 most everybody knows somebody who has fought it off or died from it its a scary scary word
2505119 i thought that one way to attack him was through the feet but he used my tactic against me and it was a very well executed move
2505120 in 2003 i was going through a very difficult time and i cried a lot and i was undergoing a lot of mental difficulties
2505121 usually training is hard work but i was very happy preparing for the olympics in 2003 i won on my mental strength this time i am very happy
2505122 postmodernism is a change or be changed world the word is out reinvent yourself for the 21st century or die some would rather die than change
2505123 just a series of shared beliefs like a religion or a culture
2505124 i bet the pastor would even give you a bible if you dont have one
2505125 we are shaped by our thoughts we become what we think
2505126 australians should have access to the best infrastructure and services possible in order to maximise the potential benefits from the transition to the digital economy
2505127 connectivity should be available to all australians irrespective of where they choose to live or work
2505128 and the affordability of services including for disadvantaged members of our society is a critical element of the equation and an important policy focus for government
2505129 theyve got this national plan and within that national plan the policy will be further developed but i dont expect anything outside that
2505130 we should expect savings but theres no magic wand to make food prices go down overnight
2505131 competition can put downward pressure on prices thats the best we can hope for
2505132 seventy five per cent 80 per cent of this industry is concentrated in coles or woolworths we think thats too much they need to reduce the barriers of entry to more competitors
2505133 its going to take quite a long time to unravel particularly some of those legal covenants
2505134 woolworths has said theyre going to introduce it queensland has introduced legislation to introduce it
2505135 its becoming more and more common people are spending longer hours at work so i guess theres a reduced opportunity to meet people outside of work
2505136 people perhaps perceive that they can get to know the people who they work with better and over a longer period of time before entering into a relationship with them
2505137 whereas if you meet with someone in a bar the amount of information you perhaps have of them before deciding to pursue a relationship is perhaps a lot more limited
2505138 most workplace relationships do end and a proportion of those will always end badly
2505139 i would advise employers and organisations to make sure they have a comprehensive up to date and enforced harassment policy because failed relationships often end up in claims of sexual harassment
2505140 there needs to be rules of engagement for workplace romance and people need to know about these before they end up in the workplace relationship
2505141 i think that reflects peoples perceptions that those relationships do have more potential to damage workplace morale due to things like perceived favouritism
2505142 two peers in the workplace are having a relationship and everythings going fine then i would agree its not likely to be an issue for the organisation or the boss
2505143 i think often it becomes the business of the boss when it becomes a problem for the organisation
2505144 its because when you hear about two people who are at work who are having a relationship with one another the first thing that springs into mind isnt all the work things they are doing
2505145 the things that are made available to your memory are the social things that they are doing so that leads to a perception that this is what theyre focusing their time on which may not be the case at all
2505146 even when they pass their expiry date the awas will probably roll on because the parties are happy with the arrangement

2505148 you are a person prone to bouts of real self examination this is in sharp contrast to a striking ability you have developed to appear socially very engaged even the life and soul of the party but in a way that only convinces others you are all too aware of it being a facade you will often be at a gathering and find yourself playing a part while on the one hand youll be talkative and funny youll be detaching yourself to the point where you will find yourself watching everything going on around you and feeling utterly unable to engage youll play conversations back to yourself in your head and wonder what that person really meant when he said such and such conversations that other people wouldnt give a second thought to how have you learned to deal with this conflict though exercising control you like to show a calm self assured fluid kind of stability but because this is self consciously created it will create bouts of frustrated silliness and a delight in extremes or at least a delight in being seen to be extreme you most easily recognize this control in how you are with people around you you have learned to protect yourself by keeping people at bay because in the past you have learned to be disappointed by people you instinctively keep people at arms length until you decide they are to be allowed over that magic line into your group of close friends however once across that line the problem is that an emotional dependency kicks in which leaves you feeling very hurt or rejected if it appears that they have betrayed that status because you are prone to self examination you will be aware of these traits however you are unusually able to examine even that self examination which means that you have become concerned about what the real you is you have become all too aware of facades of sides of yourself which you present to the world and you wonder if you have lost touch with the real and spontaneous you you are very creative and have tried different avenues to utilize that ability it may not be that you specifically say paint it may be that your creativity shows itself in more subtle ways but you will certainly find yourself having vivid and well formed ideas which others will find hard to grasp you set high standards for yourself though and in many ways are a bit of a perfectionist the problem is though that it means you often dont get stuff done because you are frustrated by the idea of mediocrity and are wearied by the idea of starting something afresh however once your brain is engaged youll find yourself sailing very likely this will lead to you having considered writing a novel or some such but a fear that you wont be able to achieve quite what you want stops you from getting on with it but you have a real vision for things which others fall short of particularly in your work situation you are currently fighting against restraints upon your desire to express yourself freely partly this is because there are ways in which you have been made to feel isolated from certain groups in the past something of an outsider now what is happening is that you are taking that outsider role and defending it to the point of consciously avoiding creative and work pursuits you have an enormous cynicism towards those who prefer to be part of a group or who exhibit any cliquey behavior and you always feel a pang of disappointment when you see your close friends seeming to follow that route deep down it feels like rejection for all that introspection you have developed a sensational dry sense of humour that makes connections quickly and wittily and will leave you making jokes that go right over the heads of others you delight in it so much that youll often rehearse jokes or amusing voices to understand yourself in order to spontaneously impress others with them but this is a healthy desire to impress and although you hate catching yourself at it its nothing to be so worried about youre naturally a little disorganized a look around your living space would likely show a box of photos unorganized into albums out of date medicines broken items not thrown out and notes to yourself significantly out of date something related to this is that you tend to lack motivation because youre resourceful and talented enough to be pretty successful when you put your mind to things this encourages you to procrastinate and put them off equally youve given up dreams a little easily when your mind flitted elsewhere there are signs of an excursion into playing a musical instrument which you have since abandoned or are finding yourself less interested in you have a real capacity for deciding that such and such a thing or so and so a person will be the be all and end all of everything and be with you for ever but youd rather try and fail and swing from one extreme to the other than settle for the little that you see others content with conclusion you present something of a conundrum which wont surprise you you are certainly bright but unusually open to lifes possibiliites something not normally found among achieving people you would do well to be less self absorbed as it tends to distance you a little and to relinquish some of the control you exercise when you present that stylized version of yourself to others you could let people in a little more

2505168 we had a very long primary we had the longest primary in history and so i can imagine folks need a break from politics

2505174 sorry maam this is not the right place you will have to call the service center
2505175 you can look for the number in the showroom brochure maam
2505176 but the car has to go for servicing otherwise they will send a letter stating that my warranty is void
2505177 i want someone to pickup my vehicle for the first servicing
2505178 sure our pickup timings are from morning 11 to evening 5

2505180 you can get a pickup scheduled for the coming saturday or sunday
2505181 but i need to get this done within two days i need the vehicle on the weekend
2505182 then you will have to stay at home in between the said hours so that we can pick it up from there or you can drop the vehicle at the service center yourself

2505209 having a history of genuine savings stands a borrower in very good stead with the institutions
2505210 all they do is change the terms of the mortgage

2505259 i am excited about the resorts that we are partnering with for the u s snowboarding grand prix because not only are they all great destinations in great locations but they are creating new ways for snowboarders to ride resorts
2505260 the line up of copper boreal and killington seems like the perfect mix of progression and history which is fitting as the grand prix enters its 13th season
2505261 i am really looking forward to the grand prix being at my home mountain

2505264 it will be a unique experience having them at the race and cheering for me its a little added pressure but i thrive on pressure
2505265 killington has always been a leader and innovator in creating ways to make snowboarding at resorts better especially this year with the resort building a new burton stash trail and combined with a dedicated staff creative terrain and events like spring loaded that are legend in the sport

2505273 there is no doubt reproduction is a primary function of estrogen but estrogen has lots of functions probably hundreds
2505274 its only recently that weve had the tools to better study what their function could be
2505275 this is a very unique protein that can be center stage for both actions
2505276 its kind of interesting that you would recruit the brain production of these hormones possibly as a protective mechanism
2505277 it may be that estrogen has been protecting you throughout many years then at menopause when estrogen levels drop it cannot help the brain overcome a massive insult such as a stroke when estrogen falls maybe this pelp 1 falls too its known that stroke risk goes up after menopause as well as the risk for many other neurodegenerative disorders

2505279 we believe that 80 percent of women experience postpartum blues because of this effect of interleukin 1 beta if our hypothesis holds true lowering interleukin 1 beta levels may be a better treatment option
2505280 we enroll women who are without housing who are living from place to place we often see women who are medically high risk in combination with social and environmental challenges
2505281 we are thinking that one of the things that is missing immediately following delivery is the placenta and that this initiates a cascade of events leading to postpartum blues depression
2505282 i am especially encouraging people in southern counties to scout fields regularly paying close attention to fields that were planted late those are the ones that could sustain the worst damage if disease becomes severe
2505283 in 2006 it was a tremendous problem in south central nebraska with yield losses up to 30 percent
2505284 dry weather will help slow them down but if there is dew in the morning then there is enough moisture for this disease and others to increase
2505285 southern rust spore production usually is limited to only the upper leaf surface and tends to be more tan orange in color than that of common rust until the spore type changes and turns black later in the season
2505286 people are treating commercial corn for common rust who never had to treat before
2505287 this disease is typically more severe in the eastern corn belt and historically has only been a problem in nebraska on seed and sweet corn
2505288 gray leaf spot requires several days for obvious lesion development after fungal infection so the disease can advance without being immediately obvious to the observer and is probably one to two leaves higher on the plant than is apparent
2505289 any products applied more than two or three weeks ago are gone
2505290 if disease becomes severe some producers will need another application these also can be expensive averaging 20 an acre
2505291 its important to pay close attention to the label restrictions on the most recent version of the products label
2505292 when i look at the four protagonists in this seasons plays i see four individuals needing and seeking more from their lives more meaning more wealth more status more justice what is most interesting to me is the way they attempt to fulfill their desire and the degree to which they succeed and fail
2505293 of course having the works of great artists like stephen sondeim edith wharton hermann hesse and euripides to tell these stories is deeply rewarding for me
2505294 once again trojan athletes from throughout the world will gather at the olympics and compete successfully at the highest level in their sports
2505295 it is something weve come to expect ever since our first olympian in 1904 uscs olympic tradition of participation and success by its athletes is unlike any other university and the beijing games will further enhance that legacy
2505296 what people dont realize is she could have gone any place and the shoe company had to pay
2505297 thats a trojan family her brother was the captain of the team here shes on the pillar dedicated to usc olympians at the entrance to the katherine b loker track and field stadium if youre an olympian and go to school here thats where youre going to be
2505298 were very proud and really excited about watching the olympics
2505299 the last olympics we didnt have anyone on the team i think it says weve done a good job recruiting and developing players the last four years
2505300 it will be fun for trojan fans across the globe to root on the many usc athletes who will be competing in beijing
2505301 a number of those trojans have excellent chances of bringing home medals not only will their home countries be solidly behind them in their quest but so will the entire trojan family
2505302 after the game i was halfway in tears because i had not been out there in so long like 2 years and i was happy just to get the opportunity to play again i was happy but at the same time a little bit nervous i was all over the place

2505318 my dad taught me a lot growing up about music and bands and songwriting and song structure
2505319 so i kind of had a heads up and all but when i started writing songs and putting them up on myspace that was a whole different thing that my dad had no idea about i was learning on my own
2505320 ill start playing guitar and then ill start singing a melody and then whatever emotions i have inside of me will turn into a song

2505334 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
2505335 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
2505336 though we did experience some difficulty with all the members of the warren commission ford was of considerable help to the bureau
2505337 it is now easier than ever for companies to give all employees a google com search experience inside their business
2505338 with the improved architecture for the search appliance businesses can provide secure search across the largest enterprise content repositories such as documentum filenet livelink and sharepoint all from one easy to maintain appliance
2505339 we were invited to participate in the beta program for the new google search appliance and were extremely pleased with its simplified deployment architecture
2505340 being able to search 10 million documents in a box not only makes maintenance and deployment across our domestic and international locations much easier but we also get the same fast reliable and relevant search results weve come to expect from google
2505341 for us choosing an enterprise search solution came down to two factors getting the quickest and most relevant search results not only does the google search appliance deliver fast and relevant results but our employees and agents dont need anything more technical than a few keywords to find what they need
2505342 and the new personalization biasing and alert features represent the type of user focused innovation that makes the google search appliance a good fit for our agents and for our organization

2505374 a reasonable number of holy days and traditional foods for feast days
2505375 too many americans have lost sight of the optimism and ingenuity that made our country great
2505376 its almost like weve given up hope of a bright future for our nation and that perception is far sadder than the actual hardships we face history suggests that americans can do anything we set our minds to and its time we remembered that fact
2505377 we must invest first and foremost in our education system for all kids whether they are rich or poor black brown or white
2505378 school must be more than a place kids go to learn how to read and write multiply and divide its where they must develop special skills that prepare them for successful careers in an increasingly competitive global marketplace and its where they must develop basic life skills such as honesty perseverance self discipline and respect by making sure that our young people get what they really need to be productive and successful members of society well be tackling our problems where they begin
2505379 i think what weve been able to do at university academy could be done on a larger scale throughout the country
2505380 the american dream is alive and well i see it every day with the kids i teach we need only to re harness and refocus some of the ingenuity that made our country special so that more citizens can achieve their dreams and that starts with improving the way we educate all of our children
2505381 like any service business quality is dependent on the caliber of individuals who are providing the service
2505382 we must recognize that compared to countries in which student academic achievement is higher than in the u s our teachers are undervalued and under appreciated particularly in the urban core this is significant because after all teaching is the most important profession in the country
2505383 its no secret that many of our nations urban schools have lower standards
2505384 and out of a sense of pity too many kids who havent demonstrated academic proficiency are passed along from one grade to the next pity is a dangerous trap for an urban teacher who is tempted to feel sorry for the stereotypical poor disadvantaged kid who might be viewed as having no future no one helps kids by feeling sorry for them it tells them only that their teachers expect them to fail and creates a self fulfilling prophecy
2505385 just as medical students spend a significant amount of time training in hospitals education students should spend more time in a variety of actual classrooms observing assisting and teaching
2505386 this is particularly true for aspiring urban teachers who will face unique challenges when they start their careers education schools must also recruit much more aggressively the best and brightest high school graduates to become future teachers
2505387 schools must teach caring compassion respect and responsibility to help offset the corrosive aspects of our larger culture
2505388 after all who other than parents and religious institutions is better positioned to teach these things character education and academics go hand in hand i have discovered that there are fewer disruptions in the classroom when there is a strong emphasis on character development
2505389 we simply cant afford to have math and science programs that are sub par
2505390 in a world in which technology is changing at unprecedented rates an emphasis on math and science content coupled with teachers in all schools who are qualified to teach these subjects will help ensure our nations ability to compete in the 21st century
2505391 traditionally teacher salaries have been based largely on education and experience levels
2505392 this is in my opinion inadequate and unjust experience and education are certainly important but performance matters the most i think schools should move toward performance based compensation pay for performance is commonplace in business and it should be standard practice in the business of education it motivates workers to accomplish specific goals and it rewards top achievers why should public educators be exempt from the same opportunities that other professional managers are afforded they shouldnt
2505393 no question about it raising kids is intense and often exhausting
2505394 but to not get deeply involved in their education is to neglect a critical aspect of parenting
2505395 the growing sentiment that our societys problems are too big for any of us to conquer affects us and not just the problems themselves believe me ive seen students who once viewed themselves as having no future graduate from high school with distinction then go on to college and truly make something of themselves we all have that fighting spirit its our national birthright never ever bet against the american dream it has never let us down before and i dont believe it will fail us now

2505435 no but after he used it he confessed to me that he used it he didnt lie even at that i like him hes a nice boy he didnt give me credit for it though he didnt steal it the same b flat that i used to write igbeyin adara and the same guitar used for the intro was used for african queen

2505442 son inexistentes por una raz n elemental de derecho constitucional cuando al presidente se le delega la competencia para legislar se le pone un plazo y si dentro de ese plazo el presidente no legisla pues fenece el poder y si lo hace despu s entonces incurre en usurpaci n de autoridad estos decretos son inexistentes porque lo que le da vida es el conocimiento por parte de los ciudadanos lo que los hace vinculante para los poderes y ciudadanos es su publicaci n si no se publicaron dentro del lapso no existen y no se pueden cumplir

2505469 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2505470 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2505471 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2505472 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2505473 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2505575 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
2505576 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
2505577 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
2505578 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
2505579 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
2505580 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

2505857 la inflaci n que hoy d a tenemos es esencialmente importada pero tambi n observamos que los precios han tendido a estabilizarse si bien hubo un incremento muy importante en los commodities esos precios han retrocedido y que se diga que la empresa de la carne va a continuar con esa tendencia nos parece que no hay ninguna raz n que lo justifique
2505858 cuando uno hace anuncios de precios muy altos est atentando contra s mismo porque los consumidores cuidan su dinero y van a buscar sustitutos o van a buscar donde se compra m s barato se van a desviar al consumo del pollo del pescado y con mayor raz n ahora el consumo del cerdo y cordero que puede ser interesante para consumir en fiestas patrias
2505859 estamos haciendo una contribuci n hacia esos objetivos en general la receptividad ha sido muy buena los propios consumidores as lo han expresado y las personas que venden tambi n
2505860 dado el sistema de tasabilidad que tiene chile que es muy eficiente nosotros estamos perfectamente en condiciones de identificar claramente el lugar de donde hab an salido aquellas carnes y se produjo por la alimentaci n de los cerdos
2505861 china is sprinting into the modern era bush said with his weekly radio braodcast today from beijing
2505862 beijing is covered in skyscrapers and filled with cars and the people of china have more connections to the world than ever before

2505864 we have made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential

2505867 this online auction is proof that there are still buyers out there in the market for a new home and they would much rather get a deal on a never lived in home than a foreclosure
2505868 since homebuyers appreciate and embrace the simplicity of our online bidding process they were able to find those homes through us
2505869 despite our strong reputation and extensive experience of building homes in spain its understandable that buyers from the uk are exercising more caution than usual in the current market were delighted to be partnering sbe as it means we can offer our customers even more reassurance and confidence when it comes to parting with their hard earned cash
2505870 we researched various companies in spain picked one and bought a home from them off plan we began to worry when nothing seemed to be progressing every time we visited to see how our home was coming along we learned about more problems and we came away very worried about our investment in the end it got to the point where we were so concerned we decided to cut our losses and pull out it worked out for the best in the end as we now own a beautiful taylor woodrow home but this new safe buying scheme would have saved us a lot of time and trouble had it been in place when we first began our search
2505871 we pride ourselves on being a brand that can be trusted and wouldnt lend our name to any company that we werent 100 confident in id like to reassure all of our potential customers that this new scheme can only help reinforce their confidence in spanish property and the whole home buying process

2505881 the jury handed down a big sentence but it was a just sentence
2505882 the jury apparently took this offense seriously and wanted to send a message that a multiple dwi offender was not going to be allowed back on the roads of wichita county
2505883 dwi offenders need to be aware that the das office isnt going to take these cases lightly were going to pursue them with everything that weve got

2505893 volatility and disruptions in the capital markets became even more pronounced in july
2505894 in addition credit performance has continued to deteriorate and based on our experience last month we anticipate further increases in our combined loss reserves
2505895 given this volatility and the build up of our reserve as well as the uncertainties inherent in the us economy and the housing market we are taking a series of additional actions that reflect our ongoing focus on conserving and enhancing our capital as well as managing our credit risk through the balance of this cycle
2505896 while we expect that this year will be our peak year for credit related expenses the total amount of credit related expenses will be significant next year

2505912 humans have treasured gold for more than 5000 years and that attraction has never faded it is a symbol of beauty it is rare it is attractive and it never tarnishes but in troubled times people also see it as a great investment a safe haven to store their wealth
2505913 golds been a good investment as it rose from us500 an ounce a few years ago to us1000 earlier this year
2505914 we think it will go up again as interest rates are cut
2505915 gold could go into the thousands over the next couple of years

2505938 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

2505943 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2505944 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2505945 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2505946 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2505947 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2505948 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2505949 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

2505951 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2505952 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2505953 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2505954 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2505955 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2505956 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2505957 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2505958 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2505959 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2505960 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2505961 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2505962 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2505963 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2505964 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2505965 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2505966 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2505967 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2505968 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2505969 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

2505976 im getting there obviously ive got to take it slowly i dont want to rush back and then crash down again so its important to keep it steady
2505977 this is an important time of the season weve got the first game next week and i dont want to rush back play a bit part and then maybe aggravate the injury an remain out for further three weeks or even longer
2505978 its been hard watching the lads training and me going off doing my own bits but im getting there its important that i get this rest in come back fully fit and have the whole season ahead of me
2505979 the lesson is that we have got to all slow down
2505980 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2505981 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2505982 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2505983 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2505984 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

2505987 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2505988 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2505989 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2505990 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2505991 when i got the call this morning it was just devastating news
2505992 lets face it bernie mac was one of a kind he was the best of the best in terms of giving you a good laugh
2505993 the egyptian government imposed a new measure which increases the extent of censorship on internet users and violates their right to privacy

2505995 this severely abusive procedure proves that the security policies aim to impose constraints and censorship on internet users
2505996 but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2505997 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2505998 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2505999 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2506000 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2506001 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

2506011 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2506012 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2506013 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2506014 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2506015 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2506016 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2506017 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

2506019 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2506020 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2506021 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

2506352 there is a real crisis of modern foreign language teaching and learning on todays campuses

2506376 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the inter party dialogue
2506377 he is going to meet the three principals basically to update them on the progress made so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2506378 we are not yet sure how the meetings will go
2506379 there are things which were referred to the principals and need to be sorted out before president mbeki comes
2506380 the dialogue demonstrates that we share a common heritage and it is in our best interests to preserve that heritage and build on it
2506381 it is with this in mind that the on going dialogue between zanu pf and the two opposition mdc parties must be appreciated by every single zimbabwean

2506392 i lodged the report to clarify my name because i was never the owner of the cafe at all
2506393 it is risky because people expect you to just do one thing
2506394 im going to take the chance and show what else is a part of me
2506395 i would look at beyonce because she was doing acting and singing and im like how the hell can she do that
2506396 its ridiculous i must be a heck of a writer to produce a pornographic book without sex scenes my book is as realistic a portrayal as i could muster of the prophet muhammads harem and his domestic life of course it has sexuality but there is no sex
2506397 denise says it is a declaration of war a national security issue
2506398 think it will be far more controversial than the satanic verses sic and the danish cartoons
2506399 it could incide acts of violence by a small radical segment
2506400 its hard to believe i have so much privacy and im only 10 minutes away from downtown chattanooga
2506401 i moved from a 2 500 square foot home but i learned that getting rid of stuff is very freeing i learned that i didnt need most of what i had
2506402 my house is more like an apartment but its perfect for one or two people
2506403 it used to take me all weekend to clean up my big house on signal mountain it takes me 45 minutes to clean this one from top to bottom
2506404 i have to angle the bed so that i could have enough room to walk around
2506405 i dont use a cover on the canopy because it would make the room look even smaller
2506406 i needed a place to put my treadmill and this was the only place i had
2506407 so i made it more like a den with a small leather sofa chifferobes and a chest its really one of my favorite rooms because i enjoy exercising in here and looking out the window which overlooks the pool
2506408 this is where i spend most of my time during the summer
2506409 its not a big pool but its big enough for me and a few friends
2506410 though i love it out here especially in the evenings august is not the best time to be hanging out around the pond
2506411 the mosquitoes are awful and the humidity and heat are almost unbearable id much rather be in the pool
2506412 people rarely sit on my front porch because everyone enters the house by the pool so typically people dont see the front porch
2506413 i like to go out there during the fall because im surrounded by woods and the scenery is beautiful
2506414 its not my favorite place during the summer because raccoons wreck the place
2506415 they like playing in the fountain and they turn everything inside out
2506416 ive had quite a few boomers sell their big houses and move downtown or close to downtown
2506417 in fact most of the new downtown condos were sold to boomers many people today and not just older people want the convenience of what downtown offers younger people especially like the action of living where everything is going on
2506418 i did not play my usual game and hit less smash instead i was trying more drop shots the first round match is always tough because you tend to make mistakes early but im happy that everything went according to the script
2506419 when i saw how effective the system was i was impressed it simplified the whole process tulip said after presenting a talk on shangri la iso 14001 environ mental success story at the tra ders hotel in george town recently

2506423 the panel chaired by me will have its first meeting on aug 16
2506424 we want to make sure that the heritage buildings are preserved but we are not anti development that is why we even have a developer on board
2506425 this panel has a good mix of experts from various fields the setting up of the panel will ensure that we retain the unesco world heritage site listing when our status is re evaluated
2506426 lets not look at economic returns now it is too early we need at least 10 to 15 years before we can see the benefits if we concentrate on conservation commercial gain will follow naturally
2506427 i hope the federal government will grant us a rm200mil soft loan for this purpose there are 510 heritage buildings in deplorable conditions and are in need of immediate attention
2506428 an interest free soft loan will be a revolving fund to help us generate tourism receipts this will benefit the federal government in the long run because its revenue from taxes will increase
2506429 lets be positive i am appealing for the federal governments assistance co operation and coordination

2506447 hes popped a rib cartilage but well have to wait and see how long he will be out for

2506452 im sick and tired of people talking about bradfords demise were in a different stage as an organisation and as a team and at this moment in time we are rebuilding the team and the organisation
2506453 with some of the issues and problems weve had its a massive effort to even be in there fighting for the six never mind anything else
2506454 i saw the first few heats go out and i kind of wanted to be the top seed for tomorrow that is all i went out to do
2506455 its going to be a tough race between three or four of us
2506456 i will have to go back and talk to my coach and go back to the drawing board
2506457 i think it was just one of those days everything was going great up until i got in i got in the water and nothing happened i did the first two strokes and it didnt feel right
2506458 because he had knowledge that sylvia dominguez was abusing him and did nothing about it
2506459 it started out with six of us we kept finding caches of guns and ended up with 12 officers there
2506460 it looked like he focused on them for more of a home protection thing
2506461 he was kind of a gun fanatic gone obsessive he would legally purchase weapons and then keep them in the house he had been collecting them for a long time
2506462 this is a confirmation that parents have the right to make the educational choice that best fits their childs needs
2506463 private home educators have believed and acted upon this conviction for years as the new school year is approaching we are assured that we can continue on with the high level of education we provide for our children
2506464 the member families of my private school satellite program and i are very delighted with todays decision these parents and many other parents diligently and excellently educate their children their right to do this is fundamental
2506465 has resulted in a near absence of objective criteria and oversight for home schooling
2506466 the negotiations have been and will continue to be amiable and professional
2506467 it gives me a great deal of satisfaction to leave this property to the music academy of the west
2506468 i want to help other singers as much as possible and to this day i have very strong feelings for the music academy
2506469 marilyn has said she wants to make sure there will always be opera at the music academy through this gift i am doing my part to make marilyns wish an enduring reality
2506470 by reducing the sku count and increasing the product functionality we are giving retailers better choices while enabling consumers to get outdoors quicker to the activities they love
2506471 we are working hard to help pave the way in sustainability for the vehicle rack and cargo categories and will continue to expand upon these initiatives by constantly exploring new technologies and materials
2506472 these products give eco conscious consumers a more sustainable way to carry gear

2506475 overall the drought in the murray darling basin is getting worse
2506476 the chance that upper murray inflows will be above average for the remainder of winter and spring is very low
2506477 until there is significant rain and run off the prospects for irrigation and the environment in 2008 09 are grim
2506478 the water level in the lower lakes has temporarily stabilised but unless there is a significant improvement in water availability for south australia the outlook for the next 12 months is extremely poor
2506479 the figures for july show we had average rainfall in that month but the inflow to the river system was just 25 per cent of average that shows how dry it is
2506480 the rain that does fall is just being soaked up
2506481 the land is so dry that we need lots of rain over an extended period to get good run off
2506482 some areas of the basin do not have enough water to cover the delivery of even water for critical human stock and domestic needs and will be relying on further inflows to their dams to make up the shortfall
2506483 private storages in the north of the basin are estimated to be holding about 810 gigalitres which is less than estimates being reported in the media
2506484 in the southern basin private storage is spread across many smaller farm dams
2506485 given the current level of storage it is not feasible to refill the lakes by transferring water from other parts of the basin without any further significant rain
2506486 as little as 20 per cent of any water released in the north of the basin would reach the lower lakes meaning that four or five times the water needed at the lakes would need to be released from that far upstream
2506487 added to by growing concerns about the relationship between the council and the developer
2506488 the former ceo of the council john shane is a director of quickview the developer of the dunes project
2506489 the former general manager of infrastructure and environmental services roly kavanagh recently went to work for quickview as the site manager
2506490 independent scrutiny is the best way to make sure that all decisions are above board so i welcome this investigation
2506491 local people are also asking questions about the relationship between council staff and developers so i think the minister for local government needs to make sure the legislation is clear and the lga and councils must ensure that elected members and staff understand their obligations
2506492 as ceo of dc copper coast i was involved in bringing tst aust pty ltd into the area to assist in the development of the local economy
2506493 i consider that to be part of my responsibilities as ceo of the local council the projects undertaken by the company have proven to be a boon for the economy and the area generally
2506494 at no time did i regard myself as being in a conflict of interest nor did i on any occasion influence any decision of council which related to the activities of the company

2506598 dalam hadits ini ada dalil disyariatkannya melakukan takbir secara jahr keras bersuara di jalanan menuju mushalla sebagaimana yang biasa dilakukan kaum muslimin meskipun banyak dari mereka mulai menganggap remeh sunnah ini hingga hampir hampir sunnah ini sekedar menjadi berita termasuk yang baik untuk disebutkan dalam kesempatan ini adalah bahwa mengeraskan takbir disini tidak disyariatkan berkumpul atas satu suara menyuarakan takbir secara serempak dengan dipimpin seseorang pent sebagaimana dilakukan oleh sebagian orang demikian pula setiap dzikir yang disyariatkan untuk mengeraskan suara ketika membacanya atau tidak disyariatkan mengeraskan suara maka tidak dibenarkan berkumpul atas satu suara seperti yang telah disebutkan hendaknya kita hati hati dari perbuatan tersebut 1 dan hendaklah kita selalu meletakkan di hadapan mata kita bahwa sebaik baik petunjuk adalah petunjuknya muhammad shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
2506599 segala puji bagi allah pendapat yang paling benar tentang takbir ini yang jumhur salaf dan para ahli fiqih dari kalangan sahabat serta imam berpegang dengannya adalah hendaklah takbir dilakukan mulai dari waktu fajar hari arafah sampai akhir hari tasyriq tanggal 11 12 13 dzulhijjah dilakukan setiap selesai mengerjakan shalat dan disyariatkan bagi setiap orang untuk mengeraskan suara dalam bertakbir ketika keluar untuk shalat id ini merupakan kesepakatan para imam yang empat

2506698 i think they thought this election would fall into their laps
2506699 an artificial expectation that he needs to be way ahead at this time
2506700 history is replete with northern liberals who end up losing
2506701 anybody gone into whole foods lately and see what they charge for arugula rocket
2506702 not long ago a couple of hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
2506703 i predict that will be translate into a vote for obama
2506704 quem aos 20 anos n o comunista n o tem cora o e quem assim permanece aos 40 anos n o tem intelig ncia
2506705 at the disneyland resort in 2004 pin has a single post backing w mickey ears and is approx 1 3 4
2506706 los gobiernos del sur de asia no gastan mucho en salud p blica apenas un 1 1 por ciento ese gasto debe aumentar porque no podemos actuar sin financiaci n p blica
2506707 la india es clave para registrar avances significativos en los objetivos del milenio si la india falla habremos fallado todos
2506708 en la india hay 50 millones de mujeres que sencillamente han desaparecido por efecto de feticidios abortos nadie sabe qu pas con ellas en muchas zonas las madres prestan m s atenci n al hijo var n y le dan ventaja sobre las chicas
2506709 a veces las costumbres de las madres est n arraigadas en tradiciones incorrectas muchas consideran que la muerte del ni o es algo normal lo tienen interiorizado
2506710 m s r pida y efectiva forma de desincentivar esta actividad il cita
2506711 weapons are to be exclusively in the hands of one group the resistance group
2506712 we carry our weapons according to the orders of our leader we abandon our weapons when he orders us to do so
2506713 after receiving orders to concentrate on such matters i believe that this area of activity will grow and will serve the citizens of iraq
2506714 if we find this does not happen and the us forces change their stance over the timetable we can change direction also
2506715 this will not mean ending the ceasefire it will depend on whats going on on the ground
2506716 should consider someone with a knack for brevity and directness to balance the ticket
2506717 taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster
2506718 and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
2506719 iraq and balancing the budget mccain snarks at obama 10 times in his own address mccains gibe about a less windy running mate is part of a continuing effort by the republicans presidential campaign to turn obamas strengths against him obamas popular with younger voters and americans usually vote for the more likable presidential candidate so using political jujitsu mccain used tv ads to portray his opponent as an air headed celebrity more in the mold of than commander in chief similarly mccain uses his radio address which has no official status but is distributed by the campaign in english and spanish sound files to try to preempt gushing coverage of obamas convention acceptance speech which is to be delivered before a crowd of 70 000 at a denver stadium democratic national convention is just a couple of weeks away
2506720 it was four years ago at the same gathering that america heard a fine speech from an hes done pretty well for himself since then and the smart money in denver is on another celebrated performance
2506721 but even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall in the way of running mates
2506722 in the meantime let me take a stab at a plot summary of the obama campaign america is finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit government is too big and he wants to grow it taxes are too high and he wants to raise them congress spends too much and he proposes more we need more energy and hes against producing it
2506723 in recent days weve seen two stark examples of exactly whats wrong with washington and whats at stake in this election
2506724 i believe that we need to move in a new direction this is a defining moment in our history we can either continue down a failed course or we can choose a better future
2506725 i would like to discuss these items and see how we can help make things better no business can long exist if its middle name is santa claus and it hands out refunds nearly a year after sign up and after hours of time invested i honestly do not see a breach of contract from our side i see many and consistent attempts to help there might have been a misunderstanding at the inception of the plan is that reason to get up from this seat in the theater and walk out
2506726 mike ran and did everything in the game just about as hes done in practice and it really wasnt surprising when you watch him practice and watch him work
2506727 we felt he would have a good game and he did everything that he was called on to do
2506728 i was happy with the way i played but i know i can do a lot of things better
2506729 i just have to come out and play as well as i can and try not to make mistakes its up to the coaches and mr polian after that
2506730 land launched ballistic missile that converts to a cruise missile
2506731 except for the considerable amount of information thats appeared in unclassified chinese sources
2506732 threat d a cruise missile that separates to a supersonic missile
2506733 theres a possibility that what were seeing is that somebody is calling this thing a cruise missile because it has some of those characteristics
2506734 it maneuvers and it homes in but a cruise missile breathes air
2506735 were pretty certain the chinese have been working on this for some time
2506736 it would pose a threat i dont know how you would counter that missile
2506737 first of all we need to remove 1 000 guys from here within 96 hours after that the rest of the guys
2506738 the unplanned redeployment of georgian forces will have some impact in the near term however as with any change in force structure we will make adjustments to ensure sustainment of coalition operations
2506739 we do not anticipate their departure will result in a significant long term impact on the overall security situation in iraq
2506740 they want to go home as soon as possible and help
2506741 we have the same situation in our home as here though the territory is different we have no desert
2506742 i wish that those involved would refrain from bad mouthing my sister
2506743 im only one side of the test but im happy to participate in one
2506744 the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
2506745 an emphasis on universal as opposed to race specific programs isnt just good policy
2506746 tax laws that restore some balance to the distribution of the nations wealth
2506747 so many of the disparities that exist in the african american community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and jim crow
2506748 panasonic viera hdtv el futbol llega al alma pero entra por los ojos
2506749 and of course blanco davino and angel are major stars in the hispanic community
2506750 you got to come with a little extra to satisfy them
2506751 when i started in comedy in the clubs in 1977 blacks couldnt do certain clubs not because they were segregated they just didnt want to put the black comics out there in los angeles the clubs would have a black night people would say why dont you come by and do something i would say im a comedian dont put a title on me dont limit yourself how you start is how you finish
2506752 if you let people put tags on you youll never be able to remove them youve got to make people respect you respect is bigger than dollars and cents
2506753 why cause you scared of me scared im a say something you expletive right think i wont say something
2506754 i want people to think before they do these kinds of disruptions
2506755 i dont intend people to call and harass i dont ever ask them to do that
2506756 we should make no mistake these two countries russia and georgia are now at war
2506757 if this conflict goes on and the war machines of both countries are now gathering momentum there really could be an enormous amount of bloodshed
2506758 you got to come with a little extra to satisfy them
2506759 when i started in comedy in the clubs in 1977 blacks couldnt do certain clubs not because they were segregated they just didnt want to put the black comics out there in los angeles the clubs would have a black night people would say why dont you come by and do something i would say im a comedian dont put a title on me dont limit yourself how you start is how you finish
2506760 if you let people put tags on you youll never be able to remove them youve got to make people respect you respect is bigger than dollars and cents
2506761 why cause you scared of me scared im a say something you expletive right think i wont say something
2506762 this is one of several major medical fraud investigations that are ongoing
2506763 theres too much money being illegally stripped from public health care programs and the potential impact to those with a legitimate need is too great to let such fraud escape federal prosecution
2506764 this is a rather large operation they were receiving kickbacks up to 20 000 a month from some of these hospitals and they were delivering between 30 and 50 patients a month
2506765 received very little medical treatment and none of the treatment that she received was necessary
2506766 that made it difficult to prove and to print the rumors that john edwards had cheated on his seriously ill wife while running for president reporters were left to poke around the edges of a potentially career ending scandal in search of an opening
2506767 do not do unto others what you do not want others do unto you
2506768 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it
2506769 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state reloaded not comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2506770 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2506771 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian disaster is gathering pace
2506772 the georgian administration has found the use to its arms which they have been purchasing during the recent several years
2506773 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened the fire at their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2506774 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legal document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2506775 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a requirement because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
2506776 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2506777 he president saakashvili is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2506778 i dont think he can count on the us cavalry riding in
2506779 you dont bring in to nato a country that has this sort of trouble
2506780 it might be a signal to the russians saying that the 2014 sochi olympics will not go the way russia wants if there is no progress on the settlement
2506781 to re establish the authority of russian controlled negotiating and peacekeeping formats to capture georgian controlled villages in south ossetia and to dissuade nato from approving a membership action plan for georgia
2506782 the russians want a more direct confrontation with the west and i hope the bush administration has the wisdom not to give them that satisfaction
2506783 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
2506784 i want to tell a story that my now deceased father experienced when he was in 1946 competent organs bodies worked you have to understand to what bodies it is
2506785 russia is concerned about the fact that norway has a radar station globe 2 which is capable of a territory of 35 000 square kilometers to control

2506842 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2506843 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2506844 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2506845 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2506846 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2506847 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2506848 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2506849 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2506924 i knew these girls could do it we are all pumped up
2506925 it is hard not to be a deer in the headlights that very first race
2506926 we are very capable of surprising the world here and swimming very fast
2506927 i didnt think id swim that fast in the preliminaries
2506928 its frustrating to come ninth but for me i put together a good race
2506929 even though there was no chinese in my race it was loud as ive ever heard
2506930 the environment seemed to just keep getting bigger and louder

2506932 america has spoken candidly and consistently about our concerns over the s behavior
2506933 we have made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2506934 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2506935 they are the people who will make china a great nation in the 21st century

2506938 in the construction zone they posted it at 45 miles per hour
2506939 most of the vehicles were seeing are not reducing their speed theyre maintaining 65 miles per hour right now were targeting the people who are traveling in the higher excess of that posted speed in that area
2506940 we can have one person actually slowing down to the 45 miles per hour and you have another person coming up behind them at 65 were seeing rear end collisions
2506941 its also for the protection of the people out there on the side of the road
2506942 weve got the construction workers standing there flagging weve got people there preoccupied with the paving project our main concerns are their safety on the side of the road and the other motorists that are doing what they can to slow down

2506948 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2506949 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2506950 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2506951 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2506952 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2506953 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2506954 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2506955 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2507062 de cuantos bienes dios nos env a el m s estimable es la alegr a
2507063 dios como creador no puede ser tenido fuera de la historia
2507064 no siempre se ha subrayado suficientemente la relaci n entre la ense anza de la iglesia sobre la redenci n y la creaci n este es un tema en el que los cristianos pueden practicar su fe dando ejemplo con estilos de vida respetuosos del medio ambiente
2507065 pero si se niega a dios el mundo se ve reducido a mera materia y en un mundo cerrado en su materialismo es m s f cil que el ser humano se erija como dictador de las dem s creaturas y de la naturaleza
2507066 cuando era m s joven era m s severo y pensaba que trat ndose de sacramentos de la fe fuese m s problem tico administrarlos con amplitud con el tiempo comprend que es necesario seguir el camino del se or
2507067 la iglesia se alegra y se enorgullece de la inmensa mayor a de sus presb teros que son buenos y sumamente loables
2507068 porque sabe y reconoce expl citamente que la inmensa mayor a de nuestros sacerdotes no obstante las flaquezas y limitaciones humanas son sacerdotes dignos que donan cada d a su vida al reino de dios que aman a jesucristo y el pueblo que les fue confiado sacerdotes que se santifican en el ejercicio diario de su ministerio que perseveran hasta el fin en la mies del se or
2507069 hay s una peque a parte de sacerdotes que se desvi a veces muy gravemente pero la iglesia quiere reparar el mal por ellos realizado
2507070 en las regiones y ambientes donde desde hace siglos la fe cristiana fue predicada
2507071 se trata de una misi n o evangelizaci n misionera dentro del propio reba o que tenga por destinatarios aquellos que nosotros bautizamos pero por diversas circunstancias no conseguimos evangelizar suficientemente o perdieron el primer fervor y se alejaron
2507072 la cultura post moderna de la sociedad actual una cultura relativista secularizada agn stica y laicista tambi n ejerce una fuerte acci n erosiva sobre la fe religiosa de muchos
2507073 la iglesia es por naturaleza misionera la iglesia sabe que no puede permanecer en casa y limitarse a acoger y evangelizar a los que la buscan en sus comunidades e iglesias es preciso levantarse e ir en b squeda all donde las personas y las familias residen viven y trabajan ir tambi n a todos los servicios organizaciones instituciones y mbitos de la sociedad humana para esta misi n todos los miembros de la comunidad eclesial son llamados pastores religiosos y laicos
2507074 las olimpiadas agreg deben ser una buena oportunidad para promover el respeto la fraternidad y la paz que son bienes anhelados por la humanidad
2507075 los atletas que representan a nuestra patria se han preparado para participar en estos juegos en donde son factores determinantes la voluntad la capacidad y el talento pero tambi n por qu no la solicitud de la ayuda divina pues siempre y en todo dependemos de dios
2507076 he conocido casi la totalidad de las casas y obras de apostolado de la uni n lumen dei en el mundo por lo que soy testigo privilegiado de su ser y actuar desde sus inicios hasta el d a de hoy
2507077 he podido comprobar agrega que hasta el momento actual se cumple el ideal de su fundador el padre rodrigo molina y de su cofundadora la hna josefina serrano de ayudar al desarrollo integral seg n las directivas de la enc clica populorum progressio y los lineamientos del concilio vaticano ii

2507079 afirma anderson en un video mensaje que aparece en la mencionada web
2507080 la forma en la que aceptamos este don recibimos este privilegio y actuamos con responsabilidad determinar las maneras en las que construimos el bien de nuestras familias y comunidades
2507081 siendo fieles a nuestra vocaci n de esposos y padres somos al final fieles a nosotros mismos
2507082 si uno de la pareja homosexual es extranjero y no lleva los 2 a os de residencia legal en espa a
2507083 solo reconoce a la madre como beneficiaria de dicha ayuda obviando del concepto familia
2507084 en nuestro caso de espa oles casados con extranjeras la nica manera que la ley me permite pedir dicha ayuda como padre del reci n nacido es que mi esposa fallezca en el alumbramiento

2507086 el papa de roma augura xito a las olimp adas
2507087 la soluci n no es atragantar de preservativos y anticonceptivos a nuestros menores de 12 y 14 a os porque esta es una medida que abre el paso a la promiscuidad y el libertinaje
2507088 qu sacamos en m xico y en el estado de morelos si nicamente atascamos de preservativos y de anticonceptivos a los ni os sa es la soluci n
2507089 s lo propone que te pongas protecci n y le des vuelo a la hilacha rienda suelta y al libertinaje
2507090 lo que la iglesia propone para que se nos grave a todos
2507091 que los esposos se quieran y se ayuden hasta en la cama y luego a enfrentar la vida y no un sexo que nada m s te libre de contagios para qu si se vive en el libertinaje y el pecado
2507092 por eso agreg todo parte de la educaci n prep rate
2507093 no hace m s que coincidir con las reservas del per acerca del t rmino manifestadas en las conferencias internacionales de el cairo y de beijing
2507094 no se sabe con exactitud qui n y como se cre el concepto de salud reproductiva
2507095 en el per el concepto de salud reproductiva viene siendo aceptado por dirigentes pol ticos y de la salud sin mayor an lisis y fundamentaci n propia acogiendo pasivamente los desarrollos argumentativos que provienen del exterior
2507096 lo real es que a trav s de la salud reproductiva se trata de promover lo que hoy conocemos como la
2507097 bajo el paraguas de la salud reproductiva se encubre entre otros prop sitos las esterilizaciones forzadas esconder informaci n sobre los efectos abortivos y secundarios de algunos anticonceptivos argumentar que el embarazo empieza en la implantaci n del vulo fecundado y no en la concepci n por ejemplo para aprobar la p ldora del d a siguiente y tratar de evitar el derecho a la objeci n de conciencia de los m dicos en la legislaci n sobre salud
2507098 el tratamiento que se da a la salud reproductiva en los parlamentos y los medios tiene bastante en com n con el seguido para otras materias vinculadas con la misma como son los derechos sexuales derechos reproductivos salud sexual despenalizaci n del aborto g nero perspectiva de g nero diversidad sexual matrimonio homosexual anticoncepci n de emergencia
2507099 las iniciativas sobre las materias mencionadas cobran la forma de proyectos de ley normas de diferente rango planes y programas congresos y seminarios que buscan la adhesi n de autoridades l deres pol ticos y gobiernos a nivel central regional y local colegios profesionales a fin de que la idea de la salud reproductiva alcance legitimidad social y legal
2507100 para llevar adelante sus prop sitos los gobiernos de los pa ses desarrollados y las grandes fundaciones filantr picas asentadas en estos realizan m ltiples acciones a nivel mundial mediante el apoyo pol tico y la financiaci n de organizaciones tanto de naciones unidas principalmente el fondo de poblaci n unfpa la organizaci n mundial de la salud oms y el fondo de la onu para la infancia unicef como de ongs constituidas para estos fines en los pa ses pobres
2507101 en los pa ses latinoamericanos act an a trav s de organizaciones feministas en el per por ejemplo a trav s de manuela ramos y flora trist n que dicen representar a las mujeres y tratan de ocupar posiciones estrat gicas en los sectores de educaci n salud y el parlamento haciendo lobby ante las autoridades y los medios de comunicaci n
2507102 algunas personalidades de la pol tica y de la clase dirigente unos por convicci n y otros por conveniencia apoyan estas ideas y propuestas contribuyendo
2507103 ni incierto ni triste al contrario era gentil y fuerte
2507104 es cierto que la personalidad de montini pablo vi connotada de una intensa fuerte elevada espiritualidad celosamente custodiada por l bajo el trato de su inconfundible estilo de gentileza podr a no haberse prestado a una f cil lectura y una coherente representaci n
2507105 tal vez la prensa de entonces no tom en cuenta que pablo vi tom de la mano al concilio vaticano ii luego de su primera sesi n llev ndolo a una positiva conclusi n y promulgando todos los documentos aprobados para cuya final aprobaci n dedic personal atenci n e intervenciones precisas
2507106 quiso volver en tierra santa sobre los pasos de cristo y que visit por primera vez todos los continentes es adem s el papa de la ecclesiam suam de la populorum progressio de la octogesima adveniens y de la evangelii nuntiandi para citar solo algunos de sus documentos
2507107 es el nico papa que promulg una exhortaci n apost lica sobre la alegr a
2507108 en la publicaci n de la enc clica humanae vitae
2507109 30 a os el 6 de agosto de 1978 en castel gandolfo quietamente se apagaba casi a los 81 a os pablo vi
2507110 se conclu a as un pontificado dif cil pero decisivo para la vida de la iglesia y para su presencia en el mundo de hoy
2507111 pese a las oposiciones tenaces y graves disensos en la iglesia pese a los ataques y cr ticas sin piedad multiplicadas sobre todo tras el credo del pueblo de dios y luego de la ltima enc clica humanae vitae pablo vi nunca renunci al adecuado magisterio que en la homil a de balance del pontificado declar haber puesto al servicio y defensa de la verdad por lo que siempre estuvo dispuesto a defender la vida humana

2507119 russia needs to support these efforts so that peace can be restored as quickly as possible
2507120 to urgently convene a meeting of the european council at the level of heads of government
2507121 russian military forces have gone through all the red lines by crossing an internationally recognised border into the sovereign territory of georgia
2507122 this is a clear act with visible elements of aggression and an outrageous violation of international law with grave consequences to regional and euro atlantic stability and security as well as to euro atlantic relations with russia
2507123 iran is ready to offer any help under its principal policies of contributing to the establishment of peace and stability in the region
2507124 a worsening of the crisis could affect the whole region with its negative consequences

2507202 when the police saw the flag they immediately fired warning shots and somebody screamed someone has been shot
2507203 this is a matter for indonesia and the letter reflects u s intervention against indonesias sovereignty

2507205 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous of escalation in the crisis

2507226 weve emphasised that being a global economic leader carries with it the duty to act responsibly on matters from energy to the environment to development in africa
2507227 when i played the same hole last year i finished about ten or 15 feet short of the green so i knew it was in reach if i could get a good one away
2507228 the line was over the bigger of two trees that jutted out into the fairway i teed it up a little bit higher than normal and just caught it absolutely flush i couldnt have hit it any better
2507229 we set off down the fairway and i was surprised when i couldnt find my ball because i was sure i had hit it on line
2507230 everyone i was playing with just went crazy there were high fives cheering back slapping it was really surreal it just didnt sink it what i had done
2507231 steve was dumbstruck and it takes a lot to shut him up i can tell you we celebrated in some style that evening
2507232 in my 26 years of playing i have never even come close to a hole in one i didnt dream id get one at all so to get one on a par four is just the stuff of dreams
2507233 that is what makes golf the great game it is there are not many professionals that will get a hole in one at a par four yet there is always the chance an amateur like me could do it
2507234 this is the most fun weve had on the whole tour
2507235 you guys are the home of rock manchester is the home of rock
2507236 young people are thinking its acceptable fashionable necessary for them to protect themselves to carry a knife
2507237 but just like we made guns unacceptable we should make knives unacceptable
2507238 you need not just young people but parents and other people to say that knives in britain like guns like bullying like racism all these things are unacceptable
2507239 people in the community have got to in a sense rise up and say this is unacceptable behaviour
2507240 i dont think the british people have ever been broken by anything or anyone
2507241 i feel there is so much good being done in different parts of our country
2507242 the man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers
2507243 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2507244 the china of the future will reflect its own culture and traditions but it will also reflect the universal aspirations of mankind and theres no deeper human desire than liberty
2507245 weve advanced both our nations interests by expanding free and fair trade and encouraging the rise of a chinese middle class which can be an enormous market for american exports
2507246 we have also cooperated on other shared challenges from fighting pandemic disease to opposing
2507247 we have made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential

2507249 i first visited the country more than three decades ago when my dad was americas representative in beijing

2507251 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2507252 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
2507253 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2507254 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2507255 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2507256 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2507257 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2507258 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2507259 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2507260 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2507261 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2507262 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2507263 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

2507268 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2507269 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2507270 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2507271 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2507272 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2507273 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2507274 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2507275 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2507276 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2507277 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2507278 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2507279 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2507280 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2507281 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2507282 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2507283 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2507284 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2507285 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2507286 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2507287 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2507288 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2507289 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2507290 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2507291 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2507292 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2507293 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2507294 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2507295 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2507296 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2507297 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2507298 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2507299 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2507300 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2507301 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2507302 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2507303 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2507304 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2507305 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2507306 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2507307 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2507308 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2507309 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

2507422 if a mother like gemma began to believe shed done something which harmed her child and made them sick even though this wasnt true she would feel such an overwhelming burden of remorse and guilt that she would find it unbearable dr cooke said
2507423 if we can help one family that would be wonderful he said

2507437 i do not rule out that the hague and strasbourg courts and institutions in other cities will be involved in investigating these crimes and this inhuman drama that has been played out
2507438 were killed by their own georgian partners in the peacekeeping forces
2507439 there is a russian battalion an ossetian battalion and a georgian battalion and all of a sudden the georgians georgian peacekeepers begin shooting their russian colleagues this is of course a war crime

2507447 that income is less than a fourth of what we get for bottle milk and unfortunately that doesnt even cover the feed we will have to be selling some cows in order to get the income to keep feeding the rest of the cows
2507448 so what gives me tears is if barack obama wins kids are going to say that a black man can be president too
2507449 i think it will give so many people black latin asian even white people that feel forgotten hope i did not think i would see it in my lifetime and im only 34
2507450 with barack obama his becoming president is them becoming president because michelle was there from the beginning
2507451 i was a self centered jerk and i screwed around

2507497 were talking about the very short range rockets youre seeing coming out of gaza and longer range rockets that were fired from lebanon all the way to short range ballistic missiles that can be launched from a distance of several hundred kilometers
2507498 since the time of flight of enemy threats is very short the ability to very rapidly detect track and engage different types of threats is of cardinal importance and given the enemys variety of munitions you dont necessarily know whats coming whether its a qassem a katyusha or something else entirely youre not sure so you have to be ready and able to handle it all

2507506 then he went out to west lothian to meet up with a few lads for a game of
2507507 we all know sir bobbys not well although he will continue to battle on
2507508 if the supporters want it then thats what should happen no one knows better than them
2507509 i think it would be entirely consistent with the affection in which the town and the club hold sir bobby as was shown during the 30th anniversary celebration of the 1978 fc cup victory
2507510 i think renaming the north stand would be a really nice idea
2507511 hes been such a wonderful man for ipswich he is known and loved all around the country and we should be proud as ipswich people that hes part of our town and our club
2507512 the club has given sir bobby plenty of tributes in the past but this seems to be something that has come from the fans
2507513 its something people were discussing when the news broke that sir bobby has not got much time left
2507514 it makes sense that the north stand is the one thats being suggested because its a tribute from what the club has always referred to as the fans stand
2507515 if its something the fans want its something the club should consider
2507516 the club were delighted when sir bobby robson agreed to the galleria restaurant being renamed in his honour earlier this year
2507517 we know how proud he was and how pleased all supporters were to have the room named in this way
2507518 we are aware of the supporters petition and understand the sentiment and will give due consideration to their request
2507519 at this time as always we are wishing sir bobby the very best
2507520 im a norwich city fan its sad news about sir bobby hes done a lot and hes also been england manager hes the only ipswich town manager i respect
2507521 its a brilliant idea he was a first class manager for ipswich his work has been important to people who have got cancer it is very sad he has months to live hes a lovely man
2507522 its very sad news he is respected by the whole community im not an ipswich fan but he was a very good manager and he did a lot for the town when he was here
2507523 the north stand should definitely be named in his honour if not the whole stadium
2507524 its sad news hes a nice bloke they should rename the stand hes done so much for ipswich and he should be honoured he always supported ipswich
2507525 im a newcastle united fan i was quite shocked to hear the news about him its a good idea to rename the stand hes a nice bloke he was popular in newcastle as well i hope newcastle rename a stand or do something similar to honour him
2507526 too late for monika to come to beijing we have withdrawn monikas name from the contingent

2507541 we the state government want to find out the source of the blackout we need to know exactly what has triggered this massive state wide blackout
2507542 from 2007 to the first half of 2008 vulnerabilities affecting web server applications accounted for 51 percent of all vulnerability disclosures
2507543 without a unified process for disclosing vulnerabilities the research industry runs the risk of actually fueling online criminal activity
2507544 there is a reason why x force does not publish exploit code for the vulnerabilities we have found and perhaps it is time for others in our field to reconsider this practice

2507546 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2507547 a guy does not captain manchester united for that many years if he does not have anything about him and from the moment i talked to him i knew i was coming to a good place
2507548 id compliment you to your superiors but id probably have to crack the combo on a safe then take the tunnel inside to the center of the earth to get a code to enter into a biometric computer that only takes president nixons fingerprint or something
2507549 today gaze at everyone wondering whether they might be the one true love of your life the one destined for you and you alone and whether you might be passing them by forever act in consequence
2507550 perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add but when there is nothing left to take away
2507551 you got to come with a little extra to satisfy them
2507552 when i started in comedy in the clubs in 1977 blacks couldnt do certain clubs not because they were segregated they just didnt want to put the black comics out there in los angeles the clubs would have a black night people would say why dont you come by and do something i would say im a comedian dont put a title on me dont limit yourself how you start is how you finish
2507553 if you let people put tags on you youll never be able to remove them youve got to make people respect you respect is bigger than dollars and cents

2507561 no georgia i believe started a war in southern ossetia and we are responsible to keep the peace
2507562 we have been appreciative of the american efforts to pacify the hawks in tbilisi apparently these efforts have not succeeded quite a number of officials in washington were really shocked when all this happened
2507563 we are all guilty for this war i am personally guilty
2507564 the war in ossetia instantly showed the idiocy of our state management
2507565 to do a creeping annexation of south ossetia and abkhazia and secondly to overthrow saakashvili who is a tremendous thorn in their side
2507566 we deplore todays russian attacks by strategic bombers and missiles which are threatening civilian lives
2507567 the media industry is in total upheaval due to the internet it took a lot longer than anticipated but its now even more disruptive than we ever imagined
2507568 for people to paradoxically deal with each other as equals
2507569 youre making sure youre not exposing yourself to danger because throughout our history there has been a lot of danger there
2507570 and its not easy to change the hearts and identity of the people because of this
2507571 the equivalent of an engraved arch that says welcome to aratta
2507572 all the provinces are interested in excavating and every little town wants to be known around the world like jiroft theyre proud and there are rivalries
2507573 where could they go the desert there was no place to run and hide
2507574 and the countrys nuclear ambitions are directly related to this desire
2507575 at one time the area of the country was triple what it is now and it was a stable superpower for more than a thousand years
2507576 the borders have moved in over the centuries but this superpower nostalgia so in contradiction to reality
2507577 to know iran and what iran really is just read that transcription from cyrus
2507578 such greatness as the cylinder has been shown many times in iran
2507579 when i go abroad people get surprised when they realize that 65 percent of the college students here are girls
2507580 eventually we turned to the shiite sect which was different from the arabs who are sunni
2507581 everything went down after they came and we have never been the same
2507582 before they came we were a great and civilized power
2507583 they burned our books and raped our women and we couldnt speak farsi in public for 300 years or they took out our tongues
2507584 which is one of the oldest living languages in the world
2507585 we are a nation with such a history that the world could listen to us
2507586 we hope that by taking pride in our archaeological sites the people realize their capabilities and it imbues the soul of the nation
2507587 but they couldnt get rid of nowruz because weve been practicing nowruz for 2 500 years they dont really control us because they cant control whats inside us
2507588 i think if we had been allowed to have a democratic government
2507589 we could have been the new york of the middle east of all of asia frankly a center for finance industry commerce culture and a modern way of thinking
2507590 but it was superficial because the public had no real under standing of western culture
2507591 the ayatollahs and the ordinary people everyone has to pretend
2507592 you dont know who is telling the truth you dont know who is really religious and who isnt
2507593 but they realized this would unite the people against them
2507594 but we soon realized that the identity the government was introducing also was not exactly who we were
2507595 the persians were shown as ugly savages with a method of fighting that was unfair
2507596 there has been this constant onslaught on our identity and the reaction has always been to return to that deepest identity inside every iranian there is an emperor or an empress that is for sure
2507597 we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2507598 people dont know what it is so they equate it with hyper sexuality violence and drug culture
2507599 people on the right can always say this doesnt represent family values and they can make these negative associations with hip hop that then barack or any other candidate is put in a position to defend

2507604 without a revolutionary theory there cannot be a revolutionary movement
2507605 in reality there is perhaps no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as pride disguise it struggle with it beat it down stifle it mortify it as much as one pleases it is still alive and will every now and then peep out and show itself for even if i could conceive that i had completely overcome it i should probably be proud of my humility
2507606 clearly something is amiss in the markets that few in our strategy if anyone have experienced before
2507607 for many years the natural gas ng market has exhibited a strong tendency to make an important bottom during august september usually september specifically there were important lows in september of 2001 2003 2004 2006 and 2007 and in august of 2002 in fact over the past seven years the only failure of the august september cycle occurred in 2005 this failure can be attributed to hurricane katrina ngs august september lows are indicated on the following chart unless theres some very unusual weather in north america over the coming few months such as an extended period of much higher than normal temperatures or a hurricane in the gulf of mexico of sufficient magnitude to curtail ng production we suspect that there will be another august september low this year
2507608 dont worry its just a pair of socks some castor oil should fix the problem
2507609 the goal is to end the presence of foreign troops
2507610 we will not accept any memorandum of understanding that doesnt have specific dates to withdraw foreign forces from iraq
2507611 u s presidential candidate barack obama talks about 16 months that we think would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
2507612 the united states is now winning the war that two years ago seemed lost
2507613 that the insurgency as a whole has withered to the point where it is no longer a threat to iraqs future
2507614 systematic sectarian killings have all but ended in the capital
2507615 shiite militias notably the mahdi army of radical cleric muqtada al sadr have lost their power bases in baghdad basra and other major cities an important step was the routing of shiite extremists in the sadr city slums of eastern baghdad this spring
2507616 prime minister nuri kamal al maliki struck another blow this spring when he led a military operation against it in baghdad and in several southern cities
2507617 use of extortion and violence began alienating much of the shiite population
2507618 were turning down loans because theres not enough equity there
2507619 these people cant get interest at 6 or 6 1 2 percent at the bank but theyre getting it from me
2507620 i was shocked that this amount of money could be floating around because it never floated anywhere that i had been over the years
2507621 never floated anywhere that i had been over the years
2507622 the idealism and integrity that characterised the early members of d il ireann
2507623 if people take contributions of 30 000 40 000 or 50 000 it is very hard to explain and for that reason i do not think people should do that contributions of that order cannot ever be explained to the ordinary man or woman in the street for that reason i do not think they are appropriate
2507624 immediately stated that anything mr sherwin had to say should not be said to me but to the fianna f il legal team
2507625 je viens dapprendre de fa on officieuse mais malheureusement sans doute certaine que le petit louis vient d tre retrouv et il semble quil ne soit plus en vie
2507626 as this law of extremes begins to lose its force and as this determination wanes the political aim will reassert itself
2507627 the prime minister is reflecting a shared goal that we have
2507628 which is that as the iraqi forces become a more self reliant force well see reductions in u s forces
2507629 negotiations and discussions are ongoing every day it is important to understand that these are not talks on a hard date for withdrawal
2507630 we are looking at the necessity of terminating the foreign presence on iraqi lands and restoring full sovereignty
2507631 we will not accept any memorandum of understanding that doesnt have specific dates to withdraw foreign forces from iraq
2507632 were in a war against islamist extremists who attacked us on 9 11
2507633 transcend ed the issue of the regime of saddam hussein
2507634 will make it clear that the united states seeks no permanent bases in iraq
2507635 he hasnt been held to account for the fact that all the guys he was supposedly training in 2004 are nowhere to be seen and mosul basically collapsed after he left
2507636 thats utter poppycock not only is irans defense budget a miniscule fraction of ours our defense budget in exchange rate terms is more that twice as big as
2507637 dont call my house the day after we get together in case my wife answers
2507638 ability to wage long war is key to pentagon plan
2507639 were not leaving iraq so long as im the president
2507640 kill the men who have put you out of a job
2507641 creeping militarization of some aspects of u s foreign policy
2507642 yo rip van winkle eisenhower told us all about it 47 years ago
2507643 we may face no greater challenge from a single country than from iran
2507644 benchmark as a rough floor of how much we should spend on defense
2507645 to create a process that will encourage the executive and legislative branches to cooperate and consult
2507646 a new law that would except for emergencies require the president and congressional leaders to discuss the matter before going to war
2507647 specific statutory authorization consistent with section 8 a 1 of the war powers resolution
2507648 the president in every possible instance shall consult with congress before introducing united states armed forces into hostilities
2507649 defined the kinds of armed conflict that would be covered by the statute
2507650 any combat operation by u s armed forces lasting more than a week
2507651 actions taken by the president to repel attacks or to prevent imminent attacks on the united states its territorial possessions its embassies its consulates or its armed forces abroad
2507652 acts of reprisal against terrorists or states that sponsor terrorism
2507653 if youre a climber and you look up at a mountain you wonder if you can make it to the top
2507654 thats what rowers do with water you wonder if you can row in it
2507655 anybody stupid enough to try that can keep their boat here
2507656 once i made it i knew i could do the round trip every time
2507657 i do 44 miles in six days and this guy is doing half that in one day
2507658 im on a record pace the water is beautiful and flat perfect conditions
2507659 it takes me an hour 40 to get to our office in back bay and peter rowed there in that time
2507660 i broke down off of spectacle island once the rigger broke and the oarlock fell in the water
2507661 i rowed past the sewage treatment plant in weymouth and flagged down a fisherman who helped me load the rig onto his boat after sundown and brought me to the dock in hingham
2507662 she doesnt like me out in the harbor quite so far away but you know i do a lot of stuff in the shell that she doesnt necessarily like
2507663 it showed 10 to 15 knots of wind shifting from south to southwest trending up to 20 knots
2507664 i expect to beat the 20 knot nonsense but extra headwind and some tidal resistance suggests an arrival time just after 6 p m
2507665 the gop lost control of the congressional committees and the jigs up
2507666 we cannot have an approach to terrorism that only uses the hated words renditions and detentions and interrogations and that has an on off switch every other november
2507667 i want to be able to do whatever i want whenever i want to do it without restriction or oversight regardless of whos in charge of the country and i dont want anybody to know about it when i screw up
2507668 if todays article describing an interview you gave to the washington post is accurate i am surprised and troubled by your comments
2507669 on the defensive throughout much of the rest of the world including in its presumed haven along the afghanistan pakistan border
2507670 i have seen nothing including classified intelligence reporting that would lead me to this conclusion
2507671 al qaeda is and will remain the most serious terrorist threat to the homeland
2507672 al qaeda remains the preeminent terror threat against the united states both here at home and abroad
2507673 al qaeda and associated networks remained the greatest terrorist threat to the united states and its partners
2507674 we have clearly not succeeded in stopping core al qaeda plotting
2507675 make statements to the press leaving the misimpression that al qaeda is on the run
2507676 cia needs to get out of the news as source and subject
2507677 aj yourself and hannigan are the only two decent candidates running in this area
2507678 the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting it to come out different
2507679 we may face no greater challenge from a single country than from iran
2507680 because of its great range persistence and stealth n ucas would be able to perform missions beyond the capabilities of manned aircraft and enable us aircraft carriers to perform both their traditional missions better and to undertake completely new missions
2507681 range persistence stealth and networking the case for a carrier based unmanned combat air system
2507682 it is difficult to imagine that the program would be cancelled or delayed because it represents a great success story for navy acquisition
2507683 and more than 1 billion has been invested in this program
2507684 will likely require future carrier task forces to stand off and fight from far greater distances than in the past
2507685 this court decision is a disaster and it could cost us a city
2507686 is not going to be made by military personnel tribunals trained in the matters of warfare but that decision will be made by the most liberal judges the detainees can find
2507687 any random nut case district judge who has no knowledge of national security to set the rules for terrorists
2507688 five lawyers had decided that the supreme court counts more than the congress and the president combined in national security
2507689 that ought to be a principled argument between mccain and obama
2507690 the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it
2507691 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
2507692 iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
2507693 one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen
2507694 let me be absolutely clear iran is a grave threat
2507695 the bush team has been so incompetent vis vis iran
2507696 we may face no greater challenge from a single country than from iran
2507697 one of the last corners of decency pluralism and openness in the arab world
2507698 populated by outrageous characters and fueled with pompous outrage hubers irreverent broadside will pummel the funny bone of anyone whos served
2507699 a remarkably accomplished book striking just the right balance between ridicule and insight
2507700 the george w bush administration plans to launch an air strike against iran within the next two months
2507701 a retired u s career diplomat and former assistant secretary of state still active in the foreign affairs community speaking anonymously
2507702 echoing other reports that have surfaced in the media in the united states recently
2507703 senator diane feinstein democrat of california and senator richard lugar republican of indiana said they would write a new york times op ed piece within days
2507704 senate offices were closed for the u s memorial day holiday so feinstein and lugar were not available for comment
2507705 that the muhammads and the cohens are not all that different cant we all just get along
2507706 interesting but we cant use this just now im sure you can find other ways to promote your novel
2507707 a true political instrument a continuation of political activity by other means
2507708 alarming step forward in the militarization of the african continent
2507709 a dangerous continuation of us military expansion around the globe
2507710 you do realize they are making this up about iran
2507711 top iraq commander gen david petraeus had plotted a sequence of events that would build domestic u s political support for a possible strike against iran
2507712 that sequence of media events would fill the airwaves with spectacular news framing iran as the culprit in iraq for several days
2507713 aimed at breaking down congressional and public resistance to the idea that iranian bases supporting the meddling would have to be attacked
2507714 populated by outrageous characters and fueled with pompous outrage hubers irreverent broadside will pummel the funny bone of anyone whos served
2507715 a remarkably accomplished book striking just the right balance between ridicule and insight
2507716 a naval blockade be imposed on iran as one of several ways to pressure iran into stopping its uranium enrichment program
2507717 denied a published report that u s president george w bush intends to attack iran before the end of his term in january
2507718 is said not to have ruled out entirely the possibility of an attack on irans nuclear facilities
2507719 an unidentified official as claiming that a senior member of bushs entourage to israel last week made the statement about attacking iran in a closed meeting
2507720 israelis who spoke to bush and his entourage while they were in israel last week said they had the impression that the military option is on the table and that the president felt a sense of deep obligation to overcome the iranian threat
2507721 there was a great deal of space between the present sanctions and military action
2507722 iranian businesspeople who would not be able to land anywhere in the world would pressure the regime
2507723 populated by outrageous characters and fueled with pompous outrage hubers irreverent broadside will pummel the funny bone of anyone whos served
2507724 a remarkably accomplished book striking just the right balance between ridicule and insight
2507725 well you really have not directly answered that question if i may say so mr secretary
2507726 but what about the fact that general david petraeuss vaunted sons of iraq program is unraveling
2507727 were in a war against islamist extremists who attacked us on 9 11
2507728 are you seriously suggesting now that anyone in iraq including that gang of sand webloes who call themselves al qaeda in mesopotamia had anything whatsoever to do with the 9 11 attacks
2507729 puts his party ahead excuse me he puts his country ahead of his party
2507730 since when did that vainglorious mother exploiting miles gloriosus mccain ever put anyone or anything ahead of himself
2507731 do you believe barack obama is not ready to be president
2507732 i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
2507733 we judge with high confidence that in fall 2003 tehran halted its nuclear weapons program
2507734 a terrorist organization responsible for killing american troops in iraq
2507735 applying sanctions to restrict irans ability to import refined petroleum products
2507736 we will apply the full force of law to prevent business dealings with irans revolutionary guard corps
2507737 in practice this might well require blockading the persian gulf
2507738 a blockade would likely be regarded by the mullahs as an act of war
2507739 parts of irans nuclear program are under the control of the iranian military
2507740 clarify procurement and r amp d activities of military related institutes and companies that could be nuclear related
2507741 requested iran to provide as a transparency measure access to additional locations related inter alia to the manufacturing of centrifuges r amp d on uranium enrichment and uranium mining and milling
2507742 youre spending all my money you just want my money
2507743 we judge with high confidence that in fall 2003 tehran halted its nuclear weapons program
2507744 all nuclear material at pilot fuel enrichment plant as well as the cascade area remains under agency containment and surveillance
2507745 the results of the environmental samples taken at fep and pfep indicate that the plants have been operated as declared
2507746 the agency has been able to continue to verify the non diversion of declared nuclear material in iran
2507747 why has iran rejected thus far russias offer of uranium enrichment in russia
2507748 why is iran continuing to enrich uranium in violation of un security council resolutions
2507749 its just hard to imagine that there are innocent answers to these questions
2507750 systemic problems in securing nuclear weapons and components a primary air force responsibility
2507751 the december 2005 award to sms was tainted with improper influence irregular procurement practices and preferential treatment
2507752 i dont pick the winner but if i did id pick sms
2507753 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
2507754 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations
2507755 however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games
2507756 sites that you need to have for your job its important that you raise them for bocogs awareness
2507757 the censorship situation for those web sites has not loosened at all
2507758 well of course we do what we can there are many calls on the public purse inner cities schools hospitals kidney machines
2507759 i dont think ive read anything of his why does his name sound familiar
2507760 the transformative power of faith is not rooted in outward signs and historical facts but in inner awakenings and literary narratives only in our day has the human imagination become so degraded as to reduce truth to fact and myth to falsehood only in our day does story pale before history
2507761 these are the commandments and the ordinances that the lord commanded through moses to the israelites in the plains of moab by the jordan at jericho
2507762 then moses went up from the plains of moab to mount nebo to the top of pisgah which is opposite jericho and the lord showed him the whole land gilead as far as dan
2507763 see just as the lord my god has charged me i now teach you statutes and ordinances for you to observe in the land that you are about to enter and occupy you must observe them diligently for this will show your wisdom and discernment to the peoples who when they hear all these statutes will say surely this great nation is a wise and discerning people for what other great nation has a god so near to it as the lord our god is whenever we call to him and what other great nation has statutes and ordinances as just as this entire law that i am setting before you today
2507764 for the lord your god is god of gods and lord of lords the great god mighty and awesome who is not partial and takes no bribe who executes justice for the orphan and the widow and who loves the strangers providing them with food and clothing you shall also love the stranger for you were strangers in the land of egypt
2507765 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength the second is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself there is no other commandment greater than these
2507766 i have set before you life and death blessings and curses choose life
2507767 its good for the world to have girls playing softball and these women are going to show young girls how to win
2507768 when you take spirituality out of art what you are left with is the protocol of methodology
2507769 when you take beauty out of worship you have turned your back on the most immediate and useful way in which gods voice has been heard in the world
2507770 up until 70 100 years ago the most beautiful building in the town was the church
2507771 ideology becomes a substitute for beauty which is why so much religious art is trash
2507772 we need to reconnect ourselves with the idea of having beauty as one of our highest goals to insist that it become part of christian dialogue and culture not just worship
2507773 we need to create communities which cultivate our artistic capacities
2507774 we need art because most of us go through life half awake
2507775 as a child art shows you possibilities and awakens who you are who you might be
2507776 the fact that the role of art has been usurped by commercial entertainment is dangerous because it conditions our imaginations and our emotions in ways that are destructive if i take away from you the bread of life i do not take away your hunger but you will satisfy it more cheaply the point of entertainment is to make you feel good about yourself art calls you to something higher
2507777 a poem speaks to you in the entirety of expression intellectual imagination and physical sensation
2507778 its good for the world to have girls playing softball and these women are going to show young girls how to win
2507779 i kind of wanted to go either first or second seed
2507780 but it was a pretty smooth swim from me so ill take it
2507781 i didnt think i was going to be that fast in the prelims but its going to shape up for a pretty good race tomorrow
2507782 that no 1 seed was something that i really wanted to do after watching the first three heats i wanted to be in the middle of the pool tomorrow and hopefully that will give me some advantage to seeing everybody else
2507783 its rare for a whole team of sierra leoneans to go abroad and come back
2507784 it goes to show what sierra leone can do when it puts its mind to it we have managed to stick a feather in the cap for the country
2507785 i didnt want to disappear i want to come back here because i like my country and i want to play for the national team
2507786 it is funny to me that the most difficult tickets to obtain for the olympics is the hurdles final with liu xiang and every game that we play
2507787 i mean liu has already won a gold medal in athens and he held the world record we dont have a shot at any kind of medal i hope people are not disappointed
2507788 in terms of techniques we are indeed not of the same weight level with the us team
2507789 but we wont give up the chance it isnt so easy to compete with a team composed of the best basketball players in the world the experience is a very precious treasure in life
2507790 so many good teams that we have to play it could be difficult for us to go forward
2507791 yi jianlian has improved tremendously and he can limit nowitzki and i can take care of kaman
2507792 i dont think they are able to pose any real threat at the games
2507793 we played once we warmed up for a competition i think it was under 10 or under 12 and we hit together for a warm up
2507794 i tried to hit so good to impress him that i was tired and i couldnt play my match so i lost
2507795 i dont know much about her we never played so i just want to try to find my feet for my first match and try to perform the best i can
2507796 a lot of the top players went out in the first round
2507797 as the rounds progressed and my nerves became less and less and i kind of just let things happen and trusted my instincts and in the gold medal bout i just let everything flow
2507798 i had to take every bout today like it was the final i couldnt give anybody breathing room
2507799 we couldnt have asked for a better result today three american flags being raised on the first day of the fencing event
2507800 being at a prestigious hard university i wouldnt be able to do both well and so i think taking the time off was very important for me
2507801 i just went home to portland that was the only way i was going to have a result like this again
2507802 hospitals are either eating the cost or passing it along to insurers so you and i are paying it in increased premiums
2507803 some companies seem to figure no one is watching so they can get away with it
2507804 we feel we made an important investment in keeping these older products alive
2507805 a lot of the top players went out in the first round
2507806 as the rounds progressed and my nerves became less and less and i kind of just let things happen and trusted my instincts and in the gold medal bout i just let everything flow
2507807 i had to take every bout today like it was the final i couldnt give anybody breathing room
2507808 we couldnt have asked for a better result today three american flags being raised on the first day of the fencing event
2507809 i am very happy because during my first match i scored a goal and my team achieved a very important victory
2507810 you are always a bit nervous at the beginning especially because it is your start with a new club but after the goal everything was much better it was a dream debut in a very difficult match
2507811 we didnt know the president was here until after the game but it was great for him to come and support us
2507812 there is a lot of pressure on us but weve prepared for a long time it was a relief to win
2507813 it was good to get the butterflies and the nerves out
2507814 it was the first game of the olympics and it was kind of scary

2507822 the squad is very different both in age and in attitude now
2507823 we have formed one of the best squads in europe and not simply a collection of big names
2507824 during the summer we bought very well those that criticised are now having to praise us
2507825 some people have said that we have not signed galacticos but that is not true
2507826 what we have done is sign great players but we have eliminated the galactico culture where some players were allowed to do certain things and others not
2507827 diego is a very interesting player we have spoken to bremens management about him this summer but it is doubtful he will come this season
2507828 he is very creative and had a superb first season in the bundesliga
2507829 issues surrounding the incidents which occurred involving certain players within the northern ireland squad during the trip to iceland have now been addressed and resolved
2507830 the ifa wishes to apologise to any members of the public who were affected in any way by the behaviour of these players
2507831 the ifa has been shown up in a poor light as a result of behaviour which of course is unacceptable
2507832 while the public apology from keith gillespie goes some way towards a recognition of that the players concerned have been told quite categorically that such behaviour has caused unnecessary embarrassment to the ifa in the eyes of the football world and the public as a whole and will not be tolerated in future
2507833 the threat attributed to the turkistan islamic party tip is contained in a new video which shows a burning olympics logo and an explosion imposed over a venue to be used for the beijing games

2507838 de arts is vaak geneigd allerlei klachten toe te schrijven aan de overgang veel symptomen van depressie lijken wel op overgangsklachten moe lusteloos prikkelbaar slecht slapen pijn veranderde eetlust maar artsen vergeten nogal eens k naar de stemming te vragen horen wij van veel mensen die ons raadplegen hun dokter zegt dan het is de overgang daar moet je doorheen een ander gaat hormoonpreparaten voorschrijven of kalmerende middelen die een depressie zelfs kunnen verergeren ook de pati nten z lf vertellen vaak alleen over de lichamelijke kant van hun klachten zij vragen zich evenmin af of de oorzaak niet ergens anders ligt
2507839 we weten alles over hart en vaatziekten de oorzaken de symptomen hoe we gezonder kunnen leven om ze te voorkomen maar over psychische problemen hebben we die kennis niet we zijn nog te vaak bezig om lichamelijke klachten te wijten aan lichamelijke ziektes

2507848 nuclear weapons were created by humans and it is our responsibility to eliminate them before they eliminate us
2507849 there is much we still dont know about the candidates positions
2507850 both state in general terms that they favor the goal of a nuclear weapons free world neither of them however has discussed seeking to achieve a nuclear weapons convention a treaty that would set forth a roadmap for the phased verifiable irreversible and transparent elimination of nuclear weapons
2507851 between the two candidates senator mccains positions seem more cautious and sketchy
2507852 obama has come out in favor of removing u s nuclear weapons from hair trigger alert not developing new nuclear weapons ratifying the comprehensive test ban treaty and achieving a verifiable global ban on the production of new nuclear weapons material
2507853 well have major progress on nuclear issues no matter who is elected
2507854 it debunks the common view that obama is the most liberal democratic senator and it debunks the view that mccain is really the third bush term
2507855 adds significantly to the complications of controlling nuclear materials and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons
2507856 obama also focuses much more on securing loose unsafe nuclear materials
2507857 both mccain and obama represent a departure from the status quo
2507858 acknowledges the unacceptable risks nuclear weapons pose merely by their existence
2507859 while both candidates appear to take nuclear proliferation seriously the difference in their worldview is of utmost importance
2507860 at the end of the day what really matters is how each one would respond to a crisis situation
2507861 while both candidates appear to take nuclear proliferation seriously the difference in their worldview is of utmost importance
2507862 the only sure way to prevent nuclear terrorism is to rid the world of nuclear weapons
2507863 in the seventh decade of the nuclear age there is a glimmer of hope that new leadership in the united states may pave the way forward toward a world free of nuclear weapons

2507903 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2507904 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2507905 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2507906 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2507907 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2507908 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2507909 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2507910 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2507911 to tell you the truth this is really a shock because theres so much security here
2507912 we were told that even at the public markets there was a lot of security in plainclothes there are guards everywhere and cameras so im not sure how something like this could happen

2507929 more than 200 of emily dickinsons poems touch on scientific themes she draws on most of the sciences from physical sciences such as physics astronomy chemistry and geology to biological sciences such as botany physiology medicine and even psychology to science in general the largest category plus mathematics and applied science or technology
2507930 i pull a flower from the woods a monster with a glass computes the stamens in a breath and has her in a class
2507931 dickinson is suggesting that it is the scientific impulse not the scientific that is monstrous in its negation of the human spirit

2507937 generally speaking we regard discomfort in any form as bad news but for practitioners or spiritual warriors people who have a certain hunger to know what is true feelings like disappointment embarrassment irritation resentment anger jealousy and fear instead of being bad news are actually very clear moments that teach us where it is that were holding back they teach us to perk up and lean in when we feel wed rather collapse and back away theyre like messengers that show us with terrifying clarity exactly where were stuck this very moment is the perfect teacher and lucky for us its with us wherever we are

2507954 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2507955 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2507956 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2507957 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2507958 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2507959 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2507960 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2507961 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2507962 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2507963 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2507964 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity

2507971 well have a chat with cadel tomorrow cadels really pleased with the way he came through it he felt strong particularly in the last few laps so it wouldnt surprise me if cadel also is switched on for the time trial
2507972 for cadel to get off the bike today and think that riding the time trial is going to be a favourable option that shows that he is pretty pleased with the way the knee felt during the day
2507973 a sixth place just out of medals is a little bit of a letdown but thats taking nothing away from the way the whole lot of them rode
2507974 when youre out there and youre under the pressure and the strain youre melting away being able to block it out and carry on with the job at hand is another job on its own
2507975 i took my shooting jacket off before and i was covered in sweat my undergarments were basically drenched
2507976 like a little mouse sneaking in to steal the cheese from a trap
2507977 i think everybody knows what theyre in for tomorrow thats the day to be really really really on top of your game i probably cant emphasise that enough
2507978 absolutely the best shooter ive seen absolutely the number one in the history of the sport
2507979 he point the gun only with the high part of the body and is very difficult to be smooth
2507980 mick six months ago who would have thought he would have made the olympic games team
2507981 this result confirms he is back to his best after this i would say mick has in his mind that he is a chance for a medal
2507982 it shows i am in good condition hopefully i get a few days of recovery now i will be up there
2507983 unfortunately as soon as i started to sprint i cramped that put an end to everything but i was happy to be there
2507984 a couple of months ago i was still struck with glandular fever
2507985 to come back with that result personally it is a big step forward for me
2507986 unfortunately i am just off the podium but thats life
2507987 i remember one year going away and my youngest brother was shorter than me he was a little boy and when i came back his voice had broken his hands were bigger and he was taller than me that was a little bit sad
2507988 when i took that break i seriously didnt know if i was going to start again i really wanted that passion to be there because i knew how much id struggled in 2005 when i didnt have that motivation
2507989 i was actually able to go to university on campus
2507990 then when i started training in 07 it was like a rebirth for me as an athlete i sort of had a different perspective and i guess different motivations though my passion is as strong as it ever has been
2507991 it was good im happy with the performance it was probably my fastest heat swim ever
2507992 it doesnt necessarily look that way a lot of the girls wore the lzr racer suits and i just think ive got a lot more in me
2507993 i had a bit of a ugh moment but expected it to be tough tonight and i adjusted my plan accordingly
2507994 my plan for the next few races is to get through as comfortably as possible and if i get through to the final in eighth at least ive got a berth
2507995 top 16 was 58 5 on paper coming in and thats about what we got id hope that would get me through and i got that
2507996 youve got to expect that with heats being at night
2507997 it was always going to be a lot faster than usual and you just had to go out there and give it your all
2507998 not everything went right my turn for example was horrible and i glided and did three or four kicks to the wall
2507999 elitexc put me to fight for the belt against bao quach from california im very happy i have three victories at elite and now have a chance to fight for the belt and im already training to win this

2508016 i believe film school used to mean something when it was only about access to equipment since the advent of cheap quality digital cinema lets say 2000 as a wide release potential film schoolers have had numerous options to get ahold of equipment which are far cheaper than paying for a film degree claiming a film degree now is just the same as claiming a ba in anything else youre a dime a dozen credentials name dropping and a diploma do not make great art or even begin to suggest you possess the possibility to make great art
2508017 a place to waste your time on your ideas and other trivialities
2508018 you have to be kidding me im required to be a second semester junior before i can even touch this equipment i cant join or start a club or anything b s
2508019 spielberg hardly attended class all he wanted to do was make movies
2508020 that is if youre talented youll eventually make it regardless of whatever obstacles you encounter along the way
2508021 and being a filmmaker has a lot more to it than this moron thinks last time i checked it takes quite a few people to make a good film movie its hard to order all those people around if you dont know what they do

2508034 how could i possibly have done that on my own
2508035 our priority in this hour is to attend to the needs of the family members the u s olympic mens indoor volleyball team and staff and the entire u s olympic delegation
2508036 in addition the usoc is working closely with the united states embassy united states law enforcement authorities and local law enforcement authorities
2508037 we took some confidence out of sydney but we also got a pretty sharp reminder of just how deep we have to run in terms of substance and belief in order to sustain that sort of success
2508038 when you get people in those contexts you learn more about them
2508039 the most obvious thing for me was just how tough it was and how when a team has its back to the wall what it will do to survive
2508040 the most obvious distinction between the first performance against the all blacks and second performance was resolve in particular from the all black camp
2508041 the key is to be pro active before it becomes a crisis
2508042 this is a very passionate proud and keen group and they are keen to achieve something
2508043 theyve made a start and to be fair the start has been pretty good weve had a losing experience and it is obviously really important how we respond to that
2508044 weve suffered a loss together for the first time and the key is now to push on
2508045 ive tried many places for kung pao chicken in the city

2508048 have you been to houstons on embarcadero before man that place frikkin sucks i thought it was gonna be nice since it looks all beverly hillish and all and since it was a nice day we chose to sit outside bad idea the host wanted to seat us outside i think because we were in jeans and t shirts i was like boy i earn triple what you do and then when we sat down flies everywhere the big ones the waitress was nice but i was a little upset by the fact that they didnt have fly swatter on the menu they did have burgers and salads and steaks but i only counted about 14 menu items so i had the burger which was actually quite tasty thanks to the fly that came along with it that may have added extra flavor sheesh and then our bill damn near 70 for lunch oh hell no id rather walk down the street to gordon biersch or maybe to the pier
2508049 i had a seriously good time riding my bike from fishermans wharf over the gg bridge to sausalito and then onward to mill valley 6 miles

2508073 were born with a natural preference for sweet salty and high fat foods
2508074 infants need more of an opportunity to learn to like other flavours like fruits and vegetables in nourish well be teaching them about healthy eating habits like they do brushing their teeth or tying their shoelaces
2508075 if youre being exposed to unhealthy food and youre developing preferences for those kinds of food then it can lead to issues such as obesity
2508076 if a mums really stressed about getting the last mouthful in the infant can also sense the stress and then they can get anxious and worked up and the feeding time can become an uncomfortable experience
2508077 it can take 10 to 15 exposures for a child to accept it so its just about making sure you are re offering that food
2508078 that will delight your friends during those parties all year round

2508082 i had such a good time and the directors made me feel so comfortable
2508083 it was nerve racking but i did it and i want to do more acting i do want to be taken seriously as an actress
2508084 everyone she came across just absolutely fell in love with her
2508085 she was one of those girls who just touched your heart
2508086 there are a lot of rumours going around but the police will get to the bottom of it and in the meantime we just have to be strong for nelly
2508087 we cant point our finger at anyone even though id like to
2508088 but why was she there why was she left there
2508089 what threw us was when we found out where she was actually found
2508090 i think thats the hardest part and thats why we cant really rest until we actually know what happened
2508091 a lot of us think that her drink might have been spiked
2508092 she was already on medicationand i know she wasnt well on the thursday
2508093 im just holding on hoping it will turn out to be natural causes
2508094 if we find out it was an epileptic fit and it was just one of those things that went wrong well id rather that than find out in six or 12 months time that her drink had been spiked
2508095 when i found out i didnt want to believe it was her it still feels like oh shell call me its so unfair
2508096 you just think of all the evil out there and all the wrongdoers and they take someone as beautiful and innocent as nelly who didnt have the chance to have children or grow up
2508097 she spoke to me several hours beforehand and said mum i really dont want to go
2508098 she was rushing back home to get ready and she had other plans romantic plans and she really didnt feel like going but i guess she felt obliged
2508099 i just hold on to that maybe if she had stuck to her gut and just stayed at home maybe she would still be here
2508100 there are just so many questions that go around in your head and you try and get the answers but the only answers we are going to get is when the police finish their investigation
2508101 it was her dream job to get into perfumes and make up
2508102 she was a glamour girl absolutely gorgeous and she finally got that chance shed been waiting for
2508103 so now i think is that the way the world is
2508104 they give you what you want and then they take it away
2508105 im trying to be strong for nelly but im angry because i dont have any answers
2508106 overall the drought in the murray darling basin is getting worse
2508107 the chance that upper murray inflows will be above average for the remainder of winter and spring is very low
2508108 until there is significant rain and run off the prospects for irrigation and the environment in 2008 09 are grim
2508109 the water level in the lower lakes has temporarily stabilised but unless there is a significant improvement in water availability for south australia the outlook for the next 12 months is extremely poor
2508110 the figures for july show we had average rainfall in that month but the inflow to the river system was just 25 per cent of average that shows how dry it is
2508111 the rain that does fall is just being soaked up
2508112 the land is so dry that we need lots of rain over an extended period to get good run off
2508113 some areas of the basin do not have enough water to cover the delivery of even water for critical human stock and domestic needs and will be relying on further inflows to their dams to make up the shortfall
2508114 private storages in the north of the basin are estimated to be holding about 810 gigalitres which is less than estimates being reported in the media
2508115 in the southern basin private storage is spread across many smaller farm dams
2508116 given the current level of storage it is not feasible to refill the lakes by transferring water from other parts of the basin without any further significant rain
2508117 as little as 20 per cent of any water released in the north of the basin would reach the lower lakes meaning that four or five times the water needed at the lakes would need to be released from that far upstream
2508118 i think that theres going to have to be some hard looking by the labor party at the timing of this election
2508119 i dont want to be one to count my chickens before they hatch but i am quite confident being in this position

2508131 hey in its day that thing really made me some cash
2508132 may i have your attention everyone we all no why were here this evening to launch the career of a great new young writer one we havent seen the likes of in years
2508133 this is beautiful young and talented woman who is still in school studying and making the deans honor list
2508134 without further ado i would like to introduce you to the now distinguished author tyler harriman can we please have a big round of applause for this remarkable and talented young woman
2508135 first of all im not all that comfortable speaking in public youll have to excuse me if i manage to insert both of my proverbial feet in my mouth
2508136 this is a bittersweet occasion for me im thrilled that my book has been published and the wonderful reception it has received that is truly sweet
2508137 is that one of the real life characters in the book has died
2508138 i was informed today that admiral rufus josiah schneider has died
2508139 i am heartbroken at this he was a wonderful man that i have come to love dearly
2508140 i was dumbfounded to learn that he was an admiral he never made any mention of that all he ever said was that he was an officer in the us navy
2508141 i always thought schneider was in his sixties or seventies
2508142 until today i didnt even know his first or middle names the only name he ever used was schneider
2508143 you can imagine my surprise today when i learned he was born in 1894 he served in the marines during world war i rising from a private to a captain and received a gold star for bravery
2508144 i have no knowledge of how or why he came to montana but im grateful he did because it gave me a chance to meet him
2508145 i would like to ask you to all bow your heads for a moment in respect for a truly great man who loved and served his country and would have given his life for a cause he believed in
2508146 schneider lived his life simply having a great respect for nature and everything in it he was also a mechanical genius able to fix and build anything he bought a new truck in 1945 and was still using it when he died believing in thrift and not replacing something that wasnt broken
2508147 since i first met schneider i have seen him a number of times and we have kept up an active correspondence
2508148 i was totally unprepared for what he had done i was told by his attorney today that i was left everything that was schneiders this includes a gold mine land and a considerable fortune
2508149 in light of schneiders love of nature and the extent of the measures he took to preserve it in tact ive decided to set up a foundation in his name dedicated to preserving and expanding as well a educating about the environment the importance of living simply and the virtue of frugalness
2508150 i cant believe it is two year since we made that fateful trip
2508151 the book would definitely not have been written if it werent for two people nor would it be the book that it is if it werent for them
2508152 sherry thomas has been an absolutely wonderful editor and a great debt is owed to her
2508153 the other person is my mom she is a professor of literature at colombia she guided and directed me in my moments of uncertainty and there were many of then
2508154 speaking of my mom she has a book coming out next week and i urge all of you to attend the opening for her book
2508155 volaires book volaire trombleys book also is a product of our journey on canary her book is
2508156 i would like her to come up here and say a few words followed by my father jeremy santisteban may we have a big round of applause for my mom
2508157 good evening i dont really feel i should be speaking at tylers event
2508158 the little advice and few suggestions i gave tyler were really unneeded she has a natural talent and gift for writing and connecting with people one that i only wish that i had
2508159 my book is unimportant and will be read by few people others than those in my specialty i specialize in early twentieth century american literature
2508160 this trip was truly a creative catalyst and a stroke of genius on the part of tyler
2508161 i really appreciate tyler giving a plug for my book
2508162 the journey on canary in a lot of ways was a journey of self discovery learning about ourselves and how we inter react with one another i will always be thankful to tyler for that
2508163 we learned so much about each other and how close we are and what it means to be truly loved
2508164 i cant say any more other than i am grateful to tyler and that she has written a wonderful book that i hope everyone will read
2508165 now i believe my husband jeremy santisteban is suppose to say a few words
2508166 i tend to mumble and mutter thats why i refuse to perform group hypnosis sessions
2508167 i suppose that i should complain that im the only one that came away from the journey on canary without a book to my name but i wont
2508168 since tyler has come into my life i have been blessed
2508169 tyler is a remarkable young woman she is extremely talented and bright she not only wrote this very readable and insightful book she is a full time student with a double major and has made the deans honor list every semester
2508170 in addition to that she dances part time in a professional ballet company
2508171 as if that was not enough she has been effectively managing two horse farms in two different states
2508172 in the last two years she has become an accomplished pilot flying out on her own and generally overseeing the reconstruction of an authentic western town manhattan montana
2508173 i would like to invite each and everyone of you out to montana for a view of manhattan that cant be had here it has a spectacular skyline even if it is not as tall as the one here it is a true authentic western town and not a movie prop
2508174 i dont know how she does it how tyler accomplishes everything but im glad she does
2508175 the trip on canary was primarily a success because of tyler until we made that trip tyler had no way of knowing that she was a medium her medium ship gave a flavor and ambiance to the entire trip and wrapped it in an aura of magic
2508176 most of all i love tyler for simply being tyler she radiates a feeling of well being and reverent magic about her
2508177 i am so proud of her and the incredible book she has written
2508178 jennifer daniels what are you doing here its so wonderful to see you
2508179 im here by myself ryan had to stay in north dakota this trip and attend to his job and supervise the farm
2508180 im pregnant ryan and i are going to have a baby in five months
2508181 because my publisher demanded it my book is coming out in two months
2508182 thats fabulous i didnt know you had a book in the works whats it about
2508183 it was because of the articles i wrote about you guys that i landed a position as the upper prairie associate and assistant editor for news
2508184 may i have everyones attention i would like to introduce to you jennifer daniels anyone whose read my book will recognize the name she figures promptly in the book
2508185 and she is not only here she has a book a well written and thought out book coming out in two months
2508186 added to by growing concerns about the relationship between the council and the developer
2508187 the former ceo of the council john shane is a director of quickview the developer of the dunes project
2508188 the former general manager of infrastructure and environmental services roly kavanagh recently went to work for quickview as the site manager
2508189 independent scrutiny is the best way to make sure that all decisions are above board so i welcome this investigation
2508190 local people are also asking questions about the relationship between council staff and developers so i think the minister for local government needs to make sure the legislation is clear and the lga and councils must ensure that elected members and staff understand their obligations
2508191 as ceo of dc copper coast i was involved in bringing tst aust pty ltd into the area to assist in the development of the local economy
2508192 i consider that to be part of my responsibilities as ceo of the local council the projects undertaken by the company have proven to be a boon for the economy and the area generally
2508193 at no time did i regard myself as being in a conflict of interest nor did i on any occasion influence any decision of council which related to the activities of the company
2508194 its incredibly exciting and something that i think will change the way i think
2508195 the chinese culture is changing and evolving so to be immersed in it is a rare opportunity
2508196 its incredibly exciting and something that i think will change the way i think

2508201 to tell you the truth this is really a shock because theres so much security here
2508202 we were told that even at the public markets there was a lot of security in plainclothes there are guards everywhere and cameras so im not sure how something like this could happen
2508203 it was just unbelievable when we first entered the track that was the best part it made it real i think the whole thing was unbelievable just to be a part of it
2508204 thats one of the experiences you remember for the rest of your life
2508205 i didnt think that id be first to get it not until the finals
2508206 all of this is the origin of the one distinctly human thing the story there can be as good science about a turnip as a man there can be properly considered as good philosophy about a turnip as a man there can be without question at all a good higher mathematics about a turnip as a man but i do nit think that there could be as good a novel written about a turnip as about a man

2508215 im not sure that anyone feels good at 12 and a half thousand feet
2508216 i do feel better than the first week i was here though
2508217 i considered doing this last year but my conditioning just wasnt where it needed to be
2508218 ive been spending time in aspen and thought that it would be fun
2508219 i have done things that most people would view as hard like marathons or the leadville 100

2508221 why me why does a tree hugging people friendly dog patting baby kissing nice guy like me get afflicted with such a nasty disease i have no answers
2508222 outside my immediate family i am known as the ultimate nice guy i am the perfect un guy but there seems to be a more powerful mr hyde in me when i am with my family if cancer is the price i have to pay so that my mom and sister see another side of me believe or not i say its worth it if i die now i will be so glad they are able to see the final image of me as someone in control of his temper someone who is calm and capable of controlling himself someone at peace with himself
2508223 young people are thinking its acceptable fashionable necessary for them to protect themselves to carry a knife
2508224 but just like we made guns unacceptable we should make knives unacceptable
2508225 you need not just young people but parents and other people to say that knives in britain like guns like bullying like racism all these things are unacceptable
2508226 people in the community have got to in a sense rise up and say this is unacceptable behaviour
2508227 i dont think the british people have ever been broken by anything or anyone
2508228 i feel there is so much good being done in different parts of our country

2508236 the egyptian government imposed a new measure which increases the extent of censorship on internet users and violates their right to privacy
2508237 their names email and phone numbers before they use the internet
2508238 this severely abusive procedure proves that the security policies aim to impose constraints and censorship on internet users
2508239 i want to give her the benefit of the doubt and say maybe shes trying to understand her job better but if after a year nothing is happening then i wont vote for her again she said
2508240 i go frequently to our local schools and shopping centres and i havent seen her this year not since december
2508241 i thought wed be able to go and see her she said
2508242 we had a function on june 13 for olympians but her minders said she couldnt attend because she was overseas he said
2508243 certainly i think shes learning the ropes maybe she will be more outspoken and more visible then
2508244 its hard to understand what people want if you dont spend time here ms carritt said
2508245 im surprised to hear these reputed comments from constituents she said
2508246 into thy most holy hands we commit the keeping of our hearts
2508247 surely many graces also came because everyone endured such great heat
2508248 there is a spiritual life that we share with the angels of heaven and with the divine spirits for like them we have been formed in the image and likeness of god the bread that is necessary for living this life is the grace of the holy spirit and the love of god but grace and love are nothing without faith since without faith it is impossible to please god and faith is not conceived unless the word of god is preached faith comes through hearing and what is heart is the word of christ for the word of god is a light to the mind and a fire to the will in enables man to know god and to love him and for the interior man who lives by the spirit of god through grace it is bread and water but a bread sweeter than honey and the honeycomb a water better than wine and milk for the soul it is a spiritual treasure of merits yielding an abundance of gold and precious stones against the hardness of a heart that persists in wrongdoing it acts as a hammer against the word the flesh and the devil it serves a sword that destroys all sin
2508249 and for legal and practical purposes freeman and colley lee have been separated since december of 2007
2508250 im not a star and i dont want to be a star stars fall im an ordinary guy with an extraordinary job
2508251 an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
2508252 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent
2508253 ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
2508254 were going to drill here and were going to drill now
2508255 my opponent doesnt want to drill he wants to inflate your tires
2508256 most presidential candidates fly at about 15 000 ft barack obama has been living at 30 000 ft
2508257 the idea was lets not try to pull him down from that plane and be mad about it lets push him up to 50 000 ft and create an updraft that sends icarus a little closer to the sun
2508258 obamas foreign trip was the last proof that we needed so it is what it is
2508259 replace the bitterness within me with the sweetness of your grace
2508260 and for the interior man who lives by the spirit of god through grace it is bread and water but a bread sweeter than honey and the honeycomb

2508265 and i want to spend some time with those children as well
2508266 we had a very long primary we had the longest primary in history and so i can imagine folks need a break from politics
2508267 i think that the majority of people had been fed a constant stream of political chatter and i am sure that having a couple of weeks off and enjoying the olympics is probably what the doctor ordered for everybody
2508268 im going to go body surfing at an undisclosed location im going to see my tutu my grandmother im going to watch my girls play on the beach
2508269 its that spirit that im convinced is what america is looking for right now
2508270 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit
2508271 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
2508272 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
2508273 you got to come with a little extra to satisfy them
2508274 when i started in comedy in the clubs in 1977 blacks couldnt do certain clubs not because they were segregated they just didnt want to put the black comics out there in los angeles the clubs would have a black night people would say why dont you come by and do something i would say im a comedian dont put a title on me dont limit yourself how you start is how you finish

2508280 war is never a good thing no one wants it
2508281 they understood the hiroshima bombing because of the japanese military
2508282 the historical anomaly of dioceses that have nothing to do with the black community going all the way to africa to make these relationships
2508283 this is just another revisionist attempt to use anything to undermine the orthodox position of the church and spread the agenda of inclusiveness
2508284 as a person who knows what it means to be oppressed i refuse to allow my brothers and sisters in the faith to be discriminated against
2508285 very inappropriate to equate the struggle of blacks in africa or in the diaspora

2508291 catholic moral teaching is adamantly opposed to abortion but not to emergency contraception for victims of rape
2508292 the absolute unlawfulness of abortifacient procedures also applies to distributing prescribing and taking the morning after pill all who whether sharing the intention or not directly co operate with this procedure are also morally responsible for it
2508293 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2508294 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2508295 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries

2508333 prayer is the remedy when temptations to sin rage in the heart whenever you are tempted to sin pray and pray earnestly frequent prayer renders powerless the assaults of vice
2508334 watch ye and pray that ye enter not into temptation
2508335 when we pray to god we should pray with groaning and weeping this is possible if when at prayer we remember the sins we have com mitted their exceptional gravity and the aw ful torments we have deserved to suffer on account of our sins fear of those dread tor ments will enable us to pray with genuine sor row
2508336 can we have in our minds what better sentiments in our hearts than those of thanksgiving to god what better words are given us to utter or to write than deo gratias the idea of due thanks giving could not be expressed in fewer words what other words could give greater pleasure no other two words are so full of meaning what more profitable than their use
2508337 is a parching wind which dries up the sources of piety the dew of mercy and the streams of grace
2508338 i cried with my whole heart hear me o lord
2508339 but thou when thou shalt pray enter into thy chamber and having shut the door pray to thy father in secret
2508340 is the raising or turning of the mind to god by means of loving and humble acts of affection
2508341 i opened my mouth in prayer i begged by prayer with reiterated prayers i knocked at the door of heaven and thirsting for the grace of god i panted and drew in that heavenly grace
2508342 prayer is the raising or turning of the mind to god

2508345 my flesh and my heart hath fainted away thou art the god of my heart 130 richard of st victor and the god that is my portion for ever
2508346 an ever increasing admiring love frequently brings to the mind such floods of divine light and overwhelms the soul with such a realisation of the divine loveliness that she becomes bewildered struck to her very foundations she loses hold of the body just as the deeper a streak of lightning strikes the quicker it mounts so is it with the soul in the condition just described the more such a soul contemns herself and sinks in self abasement in presence of god s most admir able loveliness so much the higher and quicker does she rise the greater the ardour of her loving admiring desires the higher does she ascend she is carried otit of herself until she is elevated even to the topmost heights
2508347 as an angel of god and my heart was troubled for fear of thy majesty for thou my lord art very admirable and thy face is full of graces
2508348 when the soul has drunk of an abundance of interior sweetness and is completely inebriated with delight she forgets altogether what she is and what she was there and then she is transformed she is thrown into a state of supernatural love and is rapt into a marvel lous bliss producing ecstasy
2508349 how lovely are thy tabernacles o lord of hosts my soul longs and faints for the courts of the lord my heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living god
2508350 to ascend even above the cherubim and fly upon the wings of the wind
2508351 many who should have been devoutly penetrating the heavens viewing there the many mansions holding converse with the apostles and the prophets and assisting in wonder at the triumphs of the martyrs instead find themselves as base slaves to the body serve the flesh and pamper its gluttonous desires
2508352 in the day of my love i brought thee out of egypt into the land of carmel
2508353 when on the holy day of pentecost the apostles through heavenly inspiration spoke divers tongues and worked many miracles by the of the most holy name of jesus it is said that many men who were walking in the footsteps of the holy prophets elias and eliseus and had been prepared for the coming of christ by the evan preaching of john the baptist our lady of mount carmel truth and at once embraced the faith of the gospel these new christians were so happy as to be able to enjoy familiar intercourse with the blessed virgin and venerated her with so special an affection that they before all others built a chapel to the purest of virgins on that very spot of mount carmel where elias of old had seen the cloud a remarkable type of the virgin ascending many times each day they came together to the new oratory and with pious ceremonies prayers and praises honoured the most blessel virgin as the special protectress of their order for this reason people from all parts began to call them the brethren of the blessed mary of mount carmel and the sovereign pontiffs not only confirmed this title but also granted special indulgences to whoever called either the whole order or individual brothers by that name but the most noble virgin not only gave them her name and protection she also bestowed upon blessed simon the englishman the holy scapular as a token wishing the holy order to be distinguished by that heavenly garment and to be protected by it from the evils that were assailing it moreover as formerly the order was unknown ineurope and on this account many were importuning honorius iii

2508372 the players know they will be there to be shot at and it has to be a measure of their character and their confidence and their belief and their attitude
2508373 they cant think they can play the beautiful game and soar straight back up to the premier league they have to get through the battles thats what comes with being one of the favourites but they should take it as a compliment they should get confidence from that thats why i am trying to build the team with players that can make a difference but also players with character and a bit of steel because we will need that
2508374 to be the captain of birmingham and take them back into the premier league would mean so much to me i grew up 10 minutes from the ground and i know what it means to birmingham fans it would be the sweetest moment of my career i want to get promoted and win medals and i want to stabilise the club in the premier league my family and friends are all blues fans and i want to make them all proud
2508375 we have a lot of players with premier league experience it is good that we have that and that should be a big help to us but its about application and not doing anything different just because they are in a different division theyve just got to play at the level that they are capable of
2508376 to make a major team personnel change compete in the first subdivision and qualify for the team finals is a huge accomplishment and we are looking forward to competing on tuesday

2508418 i am troubled sometimes by the misogyny and materialism of a lot of rap lyrics but i think the genius of the art form has shifted the culture and helped to desegregate music
2508419 hip hop is a celebration of not only what is right but what is wrong in society
2508420 a lot of times artists like ludacris they push the envelope in terms of describing the contradictions of american society

2508438 dass es zu einer wachstumsdelle kommt ist daher sehr wahrscheinlich
2508439 selbst wenn sich herausstellen sollte dass die wirtschaftsleistung im zweiten quartal gegen ber dem vorquartal um ein prozent zur ckgegangen ist kann das wachstum wegen der guten vorgaben des letzten jahres und des au erordentlich guten ersten quartals im jahresdurchschnitt noch in der gr enordnung von zwei prozent liegen
2508440 die konjunktur d rfte sich zwar wieder leicht erholen aber nicht zu einem neuen aufschwung ansetzen
2508441 alle vorliegenden indikatoren weisen darauf hin dass wir uns in einem abschwung befinden und zwar europaweit
2508442 kommt es zu einem neuen lpreisschock fallen die wachstumsverluste erheblich h her aus als bisher angenommen
2508443 ein sinkender lpreis w rde die konjunktur ganz entscheidend stabilisieren
2508444 billigeres l wird beim konsum ein wenig helfen aber man muss realistisch bleiben
2508445 bei den gaspreisen werden wir wahrscheinlich erst einmal weitere preiserh hungen sehen und die gesamtwirtschaftlichen effekte eines sinkenden lpreises zeigen sich erst mit deutlicher verz gerung
2508446 man sollte jetzt nicht vom einen extrem ins andere verfallen
2508447 bis zum kommenden winter k nnen noch ein paar jobs entstehen und vielleicht sinkt die arbeitslosigkeit noch ganz kurz unter drei millionen
2508448 die arbeitslosenzahlen in den kommenden monaten voraussichtlich wieder etwas steigen
2508449 das wirken der agenda sollte sich daran zeigen dass bei einer wirtschaftlichen abk hlung die arbeitslosigkeit nicht in dem ma e zunimmt wie das bei abschw ngen in der vergangenheit der fall war
2508450 substanziellen r ckgang der allgemeinen wirtschaftsleistung der sich ber mehrere monate erstreckt und der in der entwicklung des realen bruttoinlandsprodukts der realeinkommen der besch ftigung der industrieproduktion sowie des gro und einzelhandelsumsatzes sichtbar wird
2508451 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2508452 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2508453 hello guys this is a danger website make sure that you are in fresh mind and you arent crazy tapi klo kmu yg gila gabung bareng ambo
2508454 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2508455 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2508456 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2508457 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2508458 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2508459 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2508460 i didnt think id swim that fast in the preliminaries

2508473 weve advanced both our nations interests by expanding free and fair trade and encouraging the rise of a chinese middle class which can be an enormous market for american exports
2508474 we have also cooperated on other shared challenges from fighting pandemic disease to opposing north koreas nuclear weapons programs
2508475 we have made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2508476 weve emphasized that being a global economic leader carries with it the duty to act responsibly on matters from energy to the environment to development in africa
2508477 i first visited the country more than three decades ago when my dad was americas representative in beijing

2508492 i dont think there is any question that the impeachment process is failing im quite positive he will resign before that
2508493 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2508494 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2508495 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2508496 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military
2508497 tass quoted russian ground forces commander vladimir boldyrev as saying
2508498 tskhinvali is now under the complete control of our troops
2508499 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2508500 i was in the hospital yesterday where i saw many civilian wounded the hospital was later destroyed by a georgian jet i dont know whether the wounded were still there
2508501 our peacekeepeers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2508502 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2508503 we are actually in the stage of preparing our departure
2508504 it will definitely not be today we are discussing with the americans the conditions of our departure which may take place tomorrow or the day after tomorrow
2508505 well face structural changes so well have to make changes fortunately they are in a stable area of iraq
2508506 they are setting up checkpoints with the border with iran and controlling entry and exit
2508507 their departure will not cause a vacuum or have any effect because wasit province is stable and iraqi forces were about to take over security of the province
2508508 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2508509 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2508510 we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity
2508511 the deputy secretary said that we deplore todays russian attacks by strategic bombers and missiles which are threatening civilian lives
2508512 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension
2508513 the build up of forces was more than expected and they moved earlier than we thought they would
2508514 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2508515 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereignty has encroached on georgias sovereignty and it is very important for us to resolve this issue as quickly as possible
2508516 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2508517 there are no gold mines or silver mines in ohio that anyone knows of but there are plenty of them in canada
2508518 were a long way from saying categorically that these things got here because of this event
2508519 theyre consistent but weve got a lot more work to do to show theres a direct connection
2508520 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2508521 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2508522 tactical battalions have completely liberated tskhinvali from georgian military forces
2508523 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous of escalation in the crisis
2508524 the russian president has specifically stressed that the only way out from the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone
2508525 there is no full scale war and russia isnt going to make a full scale war russia is just showing its willingness to defend its citizens
2508526 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2508527 if i would care to generalise and to say that the life of the jews in the camps was especially hard i could and would not face reproach for an unjust national generalisation but in the camps where i was kept it was different the jews whose experience i saw their life was softer than that of others
2508528 but it is impossible to find the answer to the eternal question who is to be blamed who led us to our death to explain the actions of the kiev cheka secret police only by the fact that two thirds were jews is certainly incorrect
2508529 my book was directed to empathise with the thoughts feelings and the psychology of the jews their spiritual component
2508530 i have never made general conclusions about a people i will always differentiate between layers of jews one layer rushed headfirst to the revolution another to the contrary was trying to stand back the jewish subject for a long time was considered prohibited zhabotinsky a jewish writer once said that the best service our russian friends give to us is never to speak aloud about us
2508531 richard wagner did not like the jews but was a great composer dostoyevsky was a great russian writer but had a very sceptical attitude towards the jews
2508532 this is not a book about how the jews and russians lived together for 200 years but one about how they lived apart after finding themselves on the same territory this book is a weak one professionally factually it is so bad as to be beyond criticism as literature it is not of any merit
2508533 i would not doubt his sincerity he says that he firmly supports the state of israel in his fiction and factual writing there are jewish characters that he writes about who are bright decent anti stalinist people
2508534 trotskys idea was that the spread of anti semitism was partly down to objections about their entrance into the civil service there is something in this that they were not just passive spectators of the revolution they were part victims and part perpetrators
2508535 it is not a question that anyone can write about without a huge amount of bravery and it needs doing in russia because the jews are quite often written about by fanatics mr solzhenitsyns book seems much more measured than that
2508536 the question of ethnicity did not have any importance either in the revolution or the story of the nkvd this was a social revolution and those who served in the nkvd and cheka were serving ideas of social change
2508537 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2508538 from 2007 to the first half of 2008 vulnerabilities affecting web server applications accounted for 51 percent of all vulnerability disclosures
2508539 without a unified process for disclosing vulnerabilities the research industry runs the risk of actually fueling online criminal activity
2508540 there is a reason why x force does not publish exploit code for the vulnerabilities we have found and perhaps it is time for others in our field to reconsider this practice
2508541 en la iglesia de visible de am rica del norte hay mucha hambre de la palabra de dios
2508542 yo s que se los que se dicen ser cristianos est n luchando para alcanzar la unidad pero creo que sigo escuchando que ha llegado el momento de definir la fe cristiana propia hist rica y ortodoxa con tanta precisi n que nadie puede perder lo que estamos diciendo
2508543 pero nosotros debemos dar siempre gracias a dios respecto a vosotros hermanos amados por el se or de que dios os haya escogido desde el principio para salvaci n mediante la santificaci n por el esp ritu y la fe en la verdad a lo cual os llam mediante nuestro evangelio para alcanzar la gloria de nuestro se or jesucristo as que hermanos estad firmes y retened la doctrina que hab is aprendido sea por palabra o por carta nuestra
2508544 bendito sea el dios y padre de nuestro se or jesucristo que nos bendijo con toda bendici n espiritual en los lugares celestiales en cristo seg n nos escogi en l antes de la fundaci n del mundo para que fu semos santos y sin mancha delante de l en amor habi ndonos predestinado para ser adoptados hijos suyos por medio de jesucristo seg n el puro afecto de su voluntad para alabanza de la gloria de su gracia con la cual nos hizo aceptos en el amado en quien tenemos redenci n por su sangre el perd n de pecados seg n las riquezas de su gracia que hizo sobreabundar para con nosotros en toda sabidur a e inteligencia d ndonos a conocer el misterio de su voluntad seg n su benepl cito el cual se hab a propuesto en s mismo de reunir todas las cosas en cristo en la dispensaci n del cumplimiento de los tiempos as las que est n en los cielos como las que est n en la tierra en l asimismo tuvimos herencia habiendo sido predestinados conforme al prop sito del que hace todas las cosas seg n el designio de su voluntad a fin de que seamos para alabanza de su gloria nosotros los que primeramente esper bamos en cristo en l tambi n vosotros habiendo o do la palabra de verdad el evangelio de vuestra salvaci n y habiendo cre do en l fuisteis sellados con el esp ritu santo de la promesa que es las arras de nuestra herencia hasta la redenci n de la posesi n adquirida para alabanza de su gloria
2508545 yo soy la vid verdadera y mi padre es el labrador todo p mpano que en m no lleva fruto lo quitar y todo aquel que lleva fruto lo limpiar para que lleve m s fruto ya vosotros est is limpios por la palabra que os he hablado permaneced en m y yo en vosotros como el p mpano no puede llevar fruto por s mismo si no permanece en la vid as tampoco vosotros si no permanec is en m yo soy la vid vosotros los p mpanos el que permanece en m y yo en l ste lleva mucho fruto porque separados de m nada pod is hacer el que en m no permanece ser echado fuera como p mpano y se secar y los recogen y los echan en el fuego y arden si permanec is en m y mis palabras permanecen en vosotros pedid todo lo que quer is y os ser hecho en esto es glorificado mi padre en que llev is mucho fruto y se is as mis disc pulos como el padre me ha amado as tambi n yo os he amado permaneced en mi amor si guardareis mis mandamientos permanecer is en mi amor as como yo he guardado los mandamientos de mi padre y permanezco en su amor estas cosas os he hablado para que mi gozo est en vosotros y vuestro gozo sea cumplido
2508546 deep down in the transmission of my soul i needed to make a change you could see something that would last for years if necessary and be a reminder of who i really was a woman who was not always and permanently afraid a woman who could change i needed to see for myself something positive that i had done a move that was not born out of hurt but strength and creativity
2508547 5 minutes dans la bouche 5 ans dans les fesses
2508548 and its a beautiful mess yes it is its like taking a guess when the only answer is yes
2508549 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2508550 i think theres a lack of loyalty on the part of clients and agencies
2508551 i never wanted to be known for one particular industry and thats what i point out to prospects
2508552 we know our business you know your business and thats what makes it a good fit
2508553 when i meet somebody i know right away whether i like them
2508554 if you like each other you can make it work
2508555 i think part of the reason why the new business game becomes difficult is you go after every pitch that moves
2508556 the smarter agencies are wanting to go after clients that are specific to their experiences
2508557 some of the most creative and accountable advertising is coming out of chicago
2508558 if you look at economics and finance its pretty creative but it wasnt really what was exciting to me
2508559 finding a way to get a consumer to do something different though is really cool
2508560 el mercado no est ajustado a un sistema de competencia y por lo tanto no se transfieren las reducciones de costes nunca al consumidor
2508561 las repercusiones en el consumidor son mucho m s discretas y su aplicaci n es considerablemente m s lenta
2508562 freedom of the press belongs to those who own one
2508563 people are definitely showing a tendency to holiday at home this year and its mostly down to the current economic climate
2508564 the everyday cost of living is higher mortgages are higher and fuel and food prices are going up
2508565 people are paying out a lot more just to live their normal lives and coupled with the fear of a recession theyre becoming a little more cautious with their money
2508566 the top european destinations to visit are spain france germany holland and italy and theyre all one third to one half more expensive than they have been in the past
2508567 cheap weekends are not so much the case any more flights are more expensive and when you actually get there the meals and accommodation are dearer too
2508568 were close to some big population centres and we have a tremendous amount of attractions on offer we have sandy beaches historic castles and beautiful areas of countryside all in a small area
2508569 i dont think well ever see a return to the days of british people holidaying primarily at home because now people have experienced foreign travel theyre not going to want to turn the clock back
2508570 but more and more people are discovering what is available on their own doorstep
2508571 apart from a couple of thunderstorms the weather has been pretty good here too
2508572 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2508573 its good for the world to have girls playing softball
2508574 and these women are going to show young girls how to win
2508575 we are committed to responding to the concerns of our community especially when it comes to issues that affect their quality of life
2508576 eignen sich um die problematik aufzuzeigen denn sie werden explizit von rebel
2508577 but i also think we were tired because the game was too intense too physical
2508578 yes playstation 3 has annouced that there new console will be able to record something on tv and be able to play it back sony held a press conferense at leipzig games to show how the new console can record digital tv and play it back
2508579 the ability of people from everywhere whether theyre black or white whether theyre japanese american or korean american or filipino american or whatever they are they are just americans that all of us can work together and all of us can join together to create a better country its that spirit that im absolutely convinced is what america is looking for right now
2508580 i try to explain this basic idea that we all have obligations to each other that we are not alone that if we see someone in need we should help
2508581 when you come from hawaii you start understanding that what is on the surface what people look like that doesnt determine who they are
2508582 they also deserve a civilian leadership that understands the most important thing we can do to make ourselves safe is to fight the right wars
2508583 this is probably the single most historic event in my lifetime not only for us as a country but as a state
2508584 it wasnt a political speech it was from the heart
2508585 when we first drove out here we were told we should organize the three democrats out here and make sure we get all three of them
2508586 but as weve come here weve noticed there are a lot of republicans who want permission to vote for obama and a lot of people who are very upset with the way the countrys going
2508587 the strength of this they know who they are they know what the local issues are they know the local things going on so they can speak to their fellow voters and also in a sense be almost character witnesses for sen obama and build support that way
2508588 as soon as a durable peace takes hold we need to move forward with dialogue and peaceful negotiations
2508589 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2508590 massive flood on mars just thirty or fourty years ago
2508591 web loggers who are campaigning against senator obamas presidential run are accusing google and obama supporters of silencing them after their web logs were marked as spam and their accounts temporarily frozen

2508610 as far as i can tell obama would be our first basketball playing president
2508611 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
2508612 semua kesulitan sesungguhnya merupakan kesempatan bagi jiwa kita untuk tumbuh

2508622 ada seorang badwi yang datang kepada rasulullah s a w dengan niat untuk memeluk islam tetapi mempunyai masalah kerana katanya masih belum mengenali tuhan rasulullah bertanya apakah yang dilihatnya sepanjang perjalanannya ke situ apabila badwi itu menjawab dia nampak tahi tahi unta rasulullah bertanya apakah yang kamu fikir apabila melihat tahi tahi unta tersebut badwi itu terus menjawab dengan bersahaja saya fikir bila ada tahi tentu ada untanya mendengar jawapan itu rasulullah terus bersabda bahwa dia sebenarnya sudah mengenal tuhan

2508626 we dont know exactly how or why its happening and the senator wont talk about it he usually insists that people keep it quiet and just report it to their pastor or priest
2508627 there is something developing here that im not sure any of us fully understands
2508628 the providential nature of what is happening on the campaign trail
2508629 its not the speeches that are drawing people anymore as good as they are
2508630 its people wanting to get better and wanting their friends and relatives to get better its the belief that theres something more here

2508639 the ajl board did not find having two different fares one for ac and the other for non ac for the first batch of brts feasible we are interested in rolling out the buses in the first stage all these buses would be diesel buses the second batch of 150 buses would be cng and we have assured the supreme court appointed bhurelal committee earlier
2508640 among the many tipoffs that we got in the aftermath of the blasts many pointed towards the sprawling jail campus that houses many notorious criminals sources say that many accused who have been booked under pota and some pakistan nationals who were arrested without relevant documents to prove their presence and for cross border terrorism know much about the blasts
2508641 it is natural that the police informers mostly are criminals themselves their track record is pretty poor and sending them behind bars in lieu of some new offence is not difficult
2508642 according to press reports the bomb squad is not provided adequate infrastructure the main shortcoming is up to date vehicle to reach the venue immediately after receipt of information as an mp i have selected ahmedabad city as a nodal district if you make an official request to mplad for appropriate vehicle for the bomb squad the same can be granted i therefore suggest that a demand of approximately rs 5 to 7 lakh can be made from your side to enable me to provide such facility to the bomb squad at ahmedabad

2508648 for me it was not zeus who made your order nor did that justice who lives with the gods below mark out such laws to hold among mankind nor did i think your orders were so strong that you a mortal man could overrun the gods unwritten and unfailing laws not now not yesterday they always live and no one knows their origins in time

2508650 taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster

2508652 as you may know the democratic national convention is just a couple of weeks away
2508653 it was four years ago at the same gathering that america heard a fine speech from an illinois state senator named barack obama hes done pretty well for himself since then and the smart money in denver is on another celebrated performance
2508654 but even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content
2508655 in the meantime let me take a stab at a plot summary of the obama campaign america is finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit government is too big and he wants to grow it taxes are too high and he wants to raise them congress spends too much and he proposes more we need more energy and hes against producing it
2508656 in recent days weve seen two stark examples of exactly whats wrong with washington and whats at stake in this election
2508657 i believe that we need to move in a new direction this is a defining moment in our history we can either continue down a failed course or we can choose a better future

2508664 i grew up seeing soundsystems at weddings parties and local government funded festivals
2508665 and my experience of dancehall came from soundtapes the recordings of reggae dances with mcs and deejays chatting over dub instrumentals were like golddust at school people traded the saxon soundsystem soundtapes round the playground
2508666 i started by rapping other peoples lyrics from the soundtapes we would take their lyrics and put our own little twist on them i did a few parties and tapes
2508667 between the ages of eight and 10 i was strictly into reggae and the first time i heard rapping was rappers delight that was a massive tune people used to sing it round school but it totally went past me to me it was soul talking a soul tune with people talking it wasnt until four years later and the film beat street that i got into rap and hip hop
2508668 viewing dancehall as separate from hip hop or as its often described a jamaican variant of hip hop is crazy as they all come from the same place in the long term which is african music
2508669 reggae caused the birth of hip hop as kool dj herc alleged inventor was jamaican and brought the soundsystem to the bronx
2508670 kool herc was jamaican he went to america with his sound dressed down his patois and flipped it into hip hop
2508671 unsung dancehall and reggae artists like the ragga twins and what they were doing with the unity soundsystem and papa levi and the saxon soundsystem in the 1980s were completely under the radar from london and the uk we wanted to highlight their influence on the here and now and try to understand english mcs in terms of their englishness and caribbean background
2508672 we made more money in the first six months on the rave scene than in the 15 years doing reggae
2508673 its always been topical smiley cultures cockney translation translated cockney for jamaicans and police officer was about being stopped and searched its the tradition of the african griot and the english town crier its the same thing storytelling a combination of stand up entertainment telling a joke telling a story motivating the crowd and getting a response
2508674 you get beautiful moments with grime mcs some of them dont even know where the culture comes from but its a beautiful thing how theyve taken it on and the influence is reaching from different generations and age groups and to people from different backgrounds not just jamaican kids

2508695 about the presidential candidates and yes i too am getting just a little sick of the overuse of the word
2508696 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was very honest in every painful with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 percent is no longer enough it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten myself up i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything that i have to help my family and others who need my help i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say
2508697 john made a terrible mistake in 2006 but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march of 2007 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2508698 in 2006 i made an serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife i had a liaison with another woman and asked for her forgiveness i am and have been and willing to take any tests necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2508699 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself

2508731 i read that article from the henrico citizen where dr morton said that in all of his 23 years of being in education no teacher had ever spoken to him like that black teacher did his words sounded just like the words of george wallace and other arrogant white leaders that had no intention of listening to reason or doing what was right morally how can they keep him in that position knowing what he has done i believe every word that that teacher said i also believe every word that is on this site if she were not telling the truth dr morton would not have attacked her so he lost control and took it personally instead of taking it personally and looking at our kids he told on himself he should have listened to her for the kids but he did what george wallace did he turned the dogs and fire hoses on her and the kids so that he could drown out the problem instead of dealing with it he is a coward just like george wallace was

2508744 let me be clear we are well over five years into a war in a country that had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
2508745 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring
2508746 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2508747 we could have made historic investments in alternative energy to create millions of american jobs we could have headed off 4 dollar a gallon gas and begun to end the tyranny of oil in our time

2508775 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
2508776 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

2508787 following an attack iran could quickly rebuild its centrifuge program in small easily hidden facilities focused on making weapon grade uranium for nuclear weapons
2508788 without that knowledge an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges
2508789 iran would likely launch a crash program to quickly obtain nuclear weapons
2508790 an attack would likely leave iran angry more nationalistic fed up with international inspectors and nonproliferation treaties and more determined than ever to obtain nuclear weapons
2508791 without such information an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges
2508792 irans decision to disperse and keep secret several of its key sites further hinders the development of a full picture of its centrifuge complex
2508793 considering the modular replicable nature of centrifuge plants we conclude that an attack on irans nuclear program is unlikely to significantly degrade irans ability to reconstitute its gas centrifuge program
2508794 an emphasis on military responses to this conflict has the effect of discouraging iran from allowing more effective iaea inspections something necessary for the successful conclusion of a diplomatic solution to irans nuclear program
2508795 iran is understandably concerned that more transparency on its part could lead to the u s and israeli militaries gaining better targeting information on its nuclear program
2508796 it is time to set aside the military option and concentrate instead on credible diplomatic approaches to end irans growing nuclear weapons capabilities
2508797 could prompt iran to hasten its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons by embarking on a crash program
2508798 iran could then build a small centrifuge plant at a secret location capable of producing weapons grade uranium for one or two nuclear weapons per year
2508799 to finance the reconstruction of the facility and continue the current program without major budgetary consequences

2508807 if you just know how to type that can be the difference between earning 1 an hour instead of 1 a day
2508808 my generation all had apple iis that we learned to type and play games on
2508809 if we can get buy in from programmers we can develop these devices and give third world schools apple ii computer labs like the ones i grew up with
2508810 its possible for each step to be correct but to yield an incorrect result because of built in ambiguity in the specifications
2508811 i would like to live with a family who likes football because i have always imagined how a football sunday would be
2508812 expect a whole host of innovative new applications to start appearing as plastic electronics comes of age
2508813 we have shown what we can do with this technology
2508814 it used to be a matter of if now its a matter of when
2508815 ive been looking for ways to more fully use the potential of the print medium
2508816 the print medium is so compelling that i and we should all be able to do more with it
2508817 the capital cost of putting in silicon solar cells is just too high
2508818 we need a technology that will bring that cost down
2508819 new microchipped passports designed to be foolproof against identity theft can be cloned and manipulated
2508820 think about san jose state alone that would have beaten a lot of nations in terms of the medal count
2508821 we had so many athletes that came from across the united states
2508822 its pretty special when you think about the depth and breadth not only from the african american athlete male and female you look at all the other guys that were there that got towed along
2508823 the level of confidence of that team because everybody there truly felt at any given time could be gold medalists and they were all correct
2508824 everybody that was on that line in 68 was capable of being a world record holder
2508825 you cant say that about the 1984 team im not taking anything way from what carl lewis did because what he did was great but those games cant compete with the 68 games
2508826 it was for all black people in america for the struggle that black people were going through in america
2508827 those medals were won for them that was my feeling and that was everybody elses feeling we were going to show our people just how great we were
2508828 there was not going to be any uniformed or unified boycott
2508829 the black schools made it very clear that not only were there athletes not going to boycott but if they were associated with the olympic project for human rights they were not only off the team they were out of school
2508830 the point was to break this headlock that american society had on black people in sport and i think they did a hell of a job
2508831 i told col miller i understand but im black and these are my brothers and sisters out there fighting for some of the same things im fighting for even in the military because there was racism in the military
2508832 if smith and carlos had finished dead last there could not have been a statement because he couldnt have been on the victory stand
2508833 it was very important to win it was important to go and compete it was more important to earn a place so you can have that soap box from which you can launch yourself
2508834 because we could not agree on a common act i think what they did was to say agree to disagree and go forth and serve
2508835 that allowed you to respect any other athlete who said this is what i want to do we were together theres no question about it
2508836 john carlos and tommie smith had no idea that it would become as big as it got
2508837 that was the longest national anthem on any planet my prayer was short
2508838 of course i was afraid i was terrified but i was a on a mission from a non secular situation which i claim even today i believed i was saved because of my belief for others not necessarily myself because i am vessel to be used for the betterment of human kind
2508839 it wasnt only smith and carlos it was everybody that protested
2508840 they might have put their fists but everybody did their own thing to show the world that were black and we wanted to be treated the same as everybody guys wore black shoes blacks socks black ribbons everybody wore something
2508841 i thought i was in shape enough to win until i saw 29 feet
2508842 when he asked me to convert the distance from meters to feet i said thats more than 29 feet he said no it cant be i said its more than 29 feet
2508843 beamon was an excitable character with a whole bunch of talent
2508844 he could put his elbow on top of a basketball goal thats how high could leap i heard a story that he could take a block of wood on top of the backboard i know he blocked one of dr js julius erving shots
2508845 in about five seconds into his run i said oh my god the man was running like i had never seen him run before
2508846 he didnt even think about coming down if you look at that jump he landed on his feet and jumped out of the pit his heel hit and his butt was over his heel and never touched the sand and had another eight inches
2508847 when i come home my eyes are wide open to see that things have not progressed
2508848 were still living the same way people are still searching for jobs people are still trying to get an education and people are still live their lives with drugs being in the midst of it all
2508849 that extra layer really represents a change in the fundamental way that critical health care is administered
2508850 so that researchers are motivated by problems faced by ibms customers
2508851 were excited by the technology and thats when we started pursuing building the first of a kind proposal
2508852 its a collaboration where we help our customers work on problems that matter to them and at the same time on problems that matter to ibm
2508853 this is a spill that occurred in a very urban area and it can impact a very large number of people
2508854 some will evaporate with sunlight but there will be residuals in the waterway which need to be cleaned up
2508855 the oil has done a lot of damage to our moonwalk area and down by the aquarium
2508856 attn parents looking for a nanny reply to comm 789323083 craigslist org date 2008 08 09 12 17am pdt who do you parents think us nannies are we get in our cars and drive to your house to watch your child or children and you expect to pay us 100 200 a week how do you expect us to live do you not think we dont also have familys to provide for you want to pay that little for childcare then you should really stay home we spend our gas driving your children around that you dont compensate us for and you know gas is exspensive you parents need to get a clue nannys commission a salary of 450 500 a week or 15 and up a hour parents you are going to get the childcare you pay for
2508857 virtual reality simulation and computer gaming are powerful tools for conditioning human behaviour
2508858 both technologies enable users to experience a range of situations that would otherwise be impossible or prohibitively dangerous or expensive
2508859 with mining activity in south australia expected to escalate in coming years it is crucial we make the environment safer for workers and protect the industry from massive oh amp s penalties the interactive nature of the simulations immerses trainees in real life situations in the mining environment without endangering themselves or others and without impeding the operations
2508860 if we can refine this cutting edge technology it will help attract workers to the minerals industry equip them with the right skills and encourage them to take further training when the need arises
2508861 for the under 21 and under 23 teams more than half of them are coloured and in five years time half of the national team could be coloured
2508862 we believe in opportunities in the past five years we have been combing the entire country to popularise rugby and hunt for young talents
2508863 each child here should have a chance to play for the springboks if they have got the talent it hasnt always been like that
2508864 we are all cognisant of the judas gold argument to explain the league breakaway
2508865 we started off slowly the ground was heavy and there was no pressure for the first 20 minutes
2508866 the pressure then started to build which paid dividends for us
2508867 we had a great youthful team out there which leaves me with hope i wanted to look at new combinations and everyone was enthusiastic
2508868 the level of rugby here is good the game of rugby here is different to what we play in the southern hemisphere it features a lot more physicality and i think that we met that with newcastle
2508869 we are all cognisant of the judas gold argument to explain the league breakaway
2508870 i just know we can improve in a couple of areas in our game
2508871 this was our first week of full training weve had for all our players since origin i was hoping they wouldnt be leg weary after all the work they did early in the week but as we saw at the end when we defended four or five sets on our line their legs were okay
2508872 so were in pretty good shape physically we just have to get our execution a little bit better perhaps
2508873 i wasnt overly impressed with the way we played to be quite honest but it just goes to show this sides a pretty gutsy side this side seems to be able to do what they have to do to win a game
2508874 and it wasnt like we were playing a b grade side either we were playing a team that has led the competition for most of the year and theyre a good footy team so it was a gutsy win
2508875 we certainly learned a lot i know we can do a better job and there are things we can work on
2508876 i would have liked a bit more of the rub of the green but youve got to cop those decisions
2508877 melbourne are a very good side once they get in front its hard to play catch up against them but we certainly pushed them all the way
2508878 this is just another game it had nothing to do with the grand final it had nothing to do with the first time we played them this season
2508879 if we play them again this year this game will have no consequence on that either
2508880 we are all cognisant of the judas gold argument to explain the league breakaway
2508881 we would expect him to abide by it once hes properly served and he was we believe after the game last night
2508882 if he plays again then we will obviously be informing the court and then its a matter for the court to decide what it does in those circumstances oreilly said
2508883 we are all cognisant of the judas gold argument to explain the league breakaway
2508884 hopefully once the afl makes a decision one way or the other that will be the end of the campaign because we as a club are trying so hard to not only meet our obligations but to exceed them
2508885 its a bit hard when at the same time a campaign is being run by your major sponsor fundamentally saying wed rather have our own team
2508886 although weve got three years to go in this particular partnership we are working very very hard to give tasmania exposure on the mainland and to bring not only increased tourism here but increased investment from corporates
2508887 but there must come a time when the tasmanian community understands the costs and the risks and if it doesnt bear up then i hope again you can fully embrace the efforts hawthorn is doing and making on your behalf
2508888 we are all cognisant of the judas gold argument to explain the league breakaway
2508889 if you are transmitting data in high quality it is very important that you dont lose any bit of information
2508890 the main part of our work is to make it easy for end users to make use of the benefits of new technologies like wimax
2508891 relay stations are much smaller than base stations and are much easier to deploy they can be fixed onto lamp posts for example
2508892 they also should only cost around one fifth of the price as the intelligence is in the base station and unlike base stations they do not require a directed backhaul connection to the internet
2508893 georgian authorities support a ceasefire and separation of the warring parties
2508894 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2508895 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe

2508902 este lugar es una fortaleza de la resistencia de decir s a la biodiversidad esta es nuestra tierra

2508915 uhhh with all due respect officer i feel that if i did so i would be betraying my own conscience and setting a bad precedent for all those citizens who share my right to vote
2508916 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
2508917 were used to seeing 10 or 20 percent of upscale homes for sale being vacant but now its about 40 percent
2508918 weve never had trouble finding managers everybody wants to live in a 2 million or 3 million home
2508919 we did nothing but foreclosures for a long time we dont really want to get back into that but we probably will banks are calling us
2508920 i hate to be the one positive person in the real estate market
2508921 were really excited about the bust because there are so many vacant homes we can be really selective almost picky
2508922 i have known adam walters for some time we recently started seeing each other and i am very happy
2508923 i stayed longer at the ivy than i had planned to and like many people at the party i probably drank more than whats recommended in the national guidelines

2508925 reba and i are extremely happy i have got nothing but the utmost respect for her our relationship is in the early stages but we are very happy

2508927 valorar lo alcanzado producto una lucha que muchos han pagados con c rceles y condena inesperada pero que nada es en vano por que la unidad de todas la luchas sociales en alg n momento de nuestra historia derrotara al sistema opresor neoliberal y pasada las elecciones municipales de octubre viviremos un chile distinto y nosotros la izquierda lo mapuche seguiremos avanzando en un proyecto de sociedad que contemple definitivamente nuestro territorio y autonom a

2508933 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados

2508965 as president alan evans must accept responsibility for the groups failure to publicly disclose on time how much money the organisation donated to the labor and coalition parties mr evans should explain if the group made a mistake or if there was an attempt to cover up the 225 000 in donations either way the law has been broken and alan evans needs to accept responsibility
2508966 we have an obligation to be involved in the political process in order to advance the interests of our members
2508967 it is important to note that we do not donate money to political parties instead we purchase tables at political functions and events that are attended by members of parliament at both a state and federal level
2508968 internally we have a set of rules that govern this process namely that what we give to one side of politics we give to another in order to ensure fairness and that we only attend those events at which there are representatives from the areas of relevance to our members
2508969 unfortunately this is a reality of being involved in the political process today
2508970 money given at fundraisers flows into the coffers of the major parties and buys influence just like direct donations what mr evans is admitting to is the potential money brings to bend the ears of mps at swanky fund raising events who knows whether nrma members are happy with their money being handed over by alan evans to political parties
2508971 the nrma has no reason to not disclose its political contributions and took steps to ensure its obligation was met
2508972 all nrma donations as defined by the state electoral funding authority have now been disclosed and the amount is listed on the efa website penalties are a matter for the authority
2508973 we thought we had an opportunity to partner with the chinese american community in chinatown to do something rather special

2509001 wenn es etwa um das thema neuwahlen geht sind nat rlich die traditionellen medien schneller die haben korrespondenten in berlin die sich den ganzen tag mit dem thema besch ftigen k nnen

2509214 leveling vain and forged charges white house has mobilized all its capacity to prevent irans peaceful nuclear activities
2509215 i say that america in its policy that aspires to impose hegemony on the world is an evil with no good in it
2509216 its amazing what a fair bit of softer data can do
2509217 the reserve bank has talked down interest rates quite a bit they made it clear in their statement thats what theyre going to do and thats been convincing for us
2509218 they want to see softer domestic demand but they want to see wages growth remain under control
2509219 there are tighter financial conditions and then theres a second round effect of falls in equity prices and a weaker housing outlook as well as higher oil prices
2509220 growth is going to slow and stay down well below potential for the next couple of years so we dont have any inflation problems
2509221 its a case of trying to avoid these downside risks to growth which appear to be there at the moment
2509222 high petrol prices the credit crunch and the reserve bank tightening has had a big dampening effect
2509223 we havent seen that rise in national income since the korean war of the 1950s
2509224 with the jobs market remaining quite resilient theres still risk to interest rates remaining at the level theyre at
2509225 well in my opinion it started about 5 years ago when janet eaton with the kentucky ag
2509226 with a renewed focus on high quality higher value wines to suit global consumer demands
2509227 we are eliminating less profitable individual labels focusing on brand building and increasing pricing to restore appropriate levels of profitability
2509228 these actions are designed to reduce our cost base and improve our margins
2509229 there will be those where the profits are so skinny that they cant be seen and those where theres too much complexity
2509230 we would like to cut those interest rates but we will have to assess what is happening to our funding costs at that time
2509231 there are many people in electorates like mine who are really doing it tough at the moment
2509232 if the reserve bank takes a view and takes a decision to cut rates they will be the very people the reserve bank has in mind
2509233 if they do not receive the full benefit of what the reserve bank has intended then in a way thats subverting what the reserve bank is trying to do through its monetary policy
2509234 the strongest indication i can give you is that we want to pass on an interest rate cut if funding costs allow
2509235 at the end of the day were a commercial organisation
2509236 i say to the commercial banks in australia that they have a responsibility to ensure that action by the reserve bank is reflected in the interest rate posture adopted by those commercial banks he told reporters in beijing
2509237 working families and australian pensioners and carers are under financial pressure from rents from mortgages from all sorts of cost of living pressures and therefore if banks are not going to do the right thing then were trying to make it possible for customers to vote with their feet he said
2509238 we believe the bank of england really had little option to keep interest rates at 5 00

2509391 they are certainly a dangerous team going forward and we have to be aware of that
2509392 but like any good team there are also going to be chances for us to play and for us to have our own chances if on the day we defend as a team and were committed for each other i think there are going to be chances for ourselves

2509405 im 37 now but ive come here because i feel theres a lot more premier league football left in me i wouldnt sign a contract that i didnt think i could fulfil to the best of my ability
2509406 the european campaign was one of the things that appealed to me but there are a lot of things about this football club that were very appealing to me
2509407 when i started speaking with aston villa it was easy to see why a lot of people are talking about this club
2509408 people are becoming very inquisitive about the things that are going on around here i think this is going to be a very exciting place to be

2509416 noi abbiamo regolarmente e di recente anche i francesi fatto toccare i porti tunisini da nostre unit navali ma se vedremmo con favore visite da parte di unit della marina turca non potremmo non avere riserve di fronte ad affacciarsi di unit britanniche e americane che mentre sul momento potrebbero dare soddisfazione a bourghiba non tarderebbero a rivelarsi unarma controproducente sostanziando i sospetti che tripoli nutre nei confronti dei due predetti paesi
2509417 lesproprio e la cacciata della comunit italiana servono in parte anche a coprire la ritirata ideologica di gheddafi sul fronte della lotta a israele oltre che a ribadire il carattere rivoluzionario del regime i colonnelli han bisogno di gesti del genere anche nel settore del petrolio ove si contenteranno per ora dellaumento del prezzo cos come continueranno ad avere bisogno di complotti veri o falsi a organizzare questi ultimi pensano i servizi speciali egiziani

2509450 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2509460 i am sure peugeot will be looking for revenge after a scot dane and italian in a german car went to france and took the coveted le mans winners trophy that they craved back to germany again
2509461 peugeot are unbeaten in the previous three le mans series races although audi have run them very close although le mans is the big one to win for a driver and a manufacturer i personally dont want to end the 2008 season with just one win under my belt

2509463 thomas hawk was forcibly removed from the san francisco moma by two security guards at the direction of the over zealous simon blint director of visitor relations how ironic is that why taking photos in the atrium sf moma policy on this their own web site specifically allows photography in the atrium hawk had also previously confirmed this personally with thea stein in the marketing and communications department of the museum didnt matter to simon blint who according to hawk went all aggressive and power trip happy even trying to eject his companion

2509469 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2509470 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2509471 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2509472 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2509473 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2509474 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2509475 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2509476 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2509477 de groep die denkt dat de veiligheid toeneemt wanneer de overheid meer over burgers weet is veel groter dan de groep die denkt dat de veiligheid dan afneemt bijvoorbeeld door misbruik van informatie de grote mate van vertrouwen die men in de overheid heeft zorgt ervoor dat men strenge veiligheidsmaatregelen niet als grote bedreiging ziet voor de persoonlijke vrijheid
2509478 faculty understand the potential of the technology and thus lead to innovative ideas amateurism rules in the design and production of educational materials
2509479 the preparation of text audio video computer based tutoring intelligent exploratory learning simulations etc
2509480 how many faculty will we be needed in ten years will the notion of classrooms survive is the present structure of the institution viable will teachers and students need to meet on campus anymore
2509481 institutional success for any higher education enterprise will depend more on successful marketing solid quality assurance and control systems and effective use of the new media than on production and communication of knowledge
2509482 generally older have completed more college credit hours and more degree programs and have a higher all college gpa than their traditional counterparts
2509483 interested in qualifications from small modules and short programs and in learning that can be done at home and fitted around work family and social obligations
2509484 rather than incorporating the responsibility for all technology and competency based functions into a single concept of faculty member universities are disaggregating faculty instructional activities and assigning them to distinct professionals
2509485 facilitator teacher organizer grader mentor role model counselor coach supervisor problem solver and liaison
2509486 design teams and instructors must anticipate isolation that can be felt by instructors who are separated from their students this isolation may affect instructor satisfaction motivation and potential long term involvement in distance learning
2509487 in the past information doubled every 10 years now it doubles every four years
2509488 for profit institutions are the fastest growing sector in education
2509489 the distinctions between and among public and private for profit and nonprofit institutions of higher education will largely disappear
2509490 by what learners need than by what has been traditionally done
2509491 traditional universities are becoming more like distance learning universities and not the opposite
2509492 obstacles as well as benefits winning accreditation providing student services setting tuition figuring out finances and transferring course credits are among the thorny issues that administrators find themselves struggling to face collectively
2509493 the central issue in courseware development at the moment is the potential for developing reusable learning objects tagging them in a systemic way storing them in well designed databases and retrieving and recombining them with other objects to create customized learning experiences for specific needs
2509494 computerized teaching programs and interactive television lectures and seminars as well as traditional methods
2509495 the cost per student of a high quality online learning program is the same as or greater than the per student cost of physical school i e traditional education
2509496 the opportunity for training is becoming one of the most desirable benefits any job can offer
2509497 todays distance education focus has dramatically shifted toward network based technologies in general and internet based delivery more specifically
2509498 even in a conventional face to face system students spend much of their time working on their own
2509499 new technologies such as wireless mobile laptop computing personal digital assistants pdas videoconferencing videostreaming virtual reality and gaming environments enhance distributed learning
2509500 clearly each institution needs to understand where on line distance education fits in its vision of the institutions future and in its mission

2509520 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2509521 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2509522 you look at our receiver corps no doubt well have a lot of competition

2509531 we became alarmed a couple of days ago when we saw he wasnt sweating like he should
2509532 when these kids try to make weight sometimes they cut corners what we believe is he did not increase his fluid intake after we told him to
2509533 we thought he was a very good shot at a medal
2509534 we try to tell the team when we have these types of adversities we still have eight guys in there and were going to try to concentrate on what weve got
2509535 ive just always thought winning a gold medal would mean more than being a world champion or winning all that money or anything
2509536 i had already felt what he had and what he was going to bring i kept my composure and finished the rounds ahead on points
2509537 i appreciate my whole family being here i appreciate the big support i thank my father who couldnt be here with us hes in los angeles hes ill im fighting for him and my daughter thats what i do
2509538 we really wanted him to work on his 1 2 punch and move to the right this guy has longer arms that shawn but he doesnt know how to use his reach as well as shawn does
2509539 they gave him a couple of months to live but hes doing good everyday he
2509540 i have nine of my family members here to support me i can look up and see them and it makes me fight a little bit more he his father has liver disease and heart and kidney problems its a tragedy but im just focusing on what i have to do im just keeping my mind focused and getting ready for the next fight
2509541 i fought here from the trials and through all the qualifiers and now im here
2509542 i talked to him yesterday and he told me buena suarte that means good luck
2509543 they have fought before and we also had a joint training camp together shawn has beaten him before in guatemala and we had a good training camp with them he knew that shawn punched harder than him and was a little bit stronger
2509544 shawn is a strong guy and we know that about him hes a warrior and i think during this olympics you will see exactly how much of a warrior he is mentally hes very strong and i think thats one thing people dont know about him its not just his physical strength hes mentally strong
2509545 its a long process the olympics but weve been working with things that people already thought about him that hes going to be a rough guy and hold but shawn can box hes a very good boxer and thats what we are going to do
2509546 our chances are very good as are everyone elses there are a lot of good boxers in the world including our boxers and the best mans going to come out on top we will find out as the days come along
2509547 whoever started off the competition for the u s team we wanted him to look
2509548 im not sure why that question was removed from qna either but im not as familiar with their code of conduct
2509549 thank you so much for stopping by and your comments have made me feel better already the big question i had was what part of the code of conduct that i violated theres a lot to it and i dont want to do it again but i dont even know what i did wrong
2509550 it turns out that questions can be removed if they arent answerable by the community at large or if they include a name of another qna member in the question itself this is done to prevent harassment according to that team if you go to the qna site they try to explain why the content was removed there
2509551 your explanation of why my question was removed is all that i wanted to know i wont do that again that was so nice of you to take the time to find out why my question was remove i am sorry and i meant no disrespect in using your name in my question and i apologize that helps me a lot and thank you for letting me know
2509552 nuestro problema no es por tanto salir a pelear con los periodistas que afirman que la formaci n acad mica no es necesaria pues nos podr an echar en cara muchas cosas en las que tendr an toda la raz n
2509553 a prepara o dos futuros profissionais para o mundo do trabalho se d com base na profunda problematiza o dos procedimentos ticos aplicados profiss o e no treinamento para o exerc cio dessa fun o de mediador da realidade social
2509554 um jornalista devidamente preparado em um curso superior obt m conhecimentos que lhe capacitam para
2509555 na minha avalia o levando em conta as complexidades e liberdades do mundo atual e o que ele exige do jornalismo o ingresso na profiss o de jornalista deveria ser acess vel a quaisquer cidad os no pleno uso dos seus direitos desde que provem ter forma o superior conclu da com exce o das atividades em que tal exig ncia seja descabida precisariam por m passar por um per odo de est gio ou experi ncia probat ria no m nimo seis meses no m ximo um ano com a devida remunera o e com a obriga o de nesse per odo fazerem estudos sobre jornalismo com orienta o pedag gica
2509556 restritivo demais pensar s no jornalismo como centro da discuss o midi tica
2509557 acredito que hoje o diploma represente uma reserva de legitima o dos sindicatos
2509558 creio que o diploma j foi importante mas n o mais as escolas de comunica o precisam vender qualidade e n o reserva de mercado para um determinado profissional
2509559 se a exig ncia do diploma acabasse amanh os cursos de comunica o continuariam iguais os cursos que fazem a diferen a dentro da forma o desse profissional continuam formando profissionais de qualidade o que muda e o que acaba s o os cursos que realmente vendiam apenas o diploma
2509560 primero habr a que poner esto en perspectiva hist rica no podemos colocar a las carreras de comunicaci n al nivel del desarrollo tanto interno de otros saberes como de la definici n de los haceres de profesiones con carreras como econom a por ejemplo stas llevan muchos a os por delante de nosotros legitim ndose como saberes y despu s configurando diferentes oficios en esto no hay que ser masoquistas las nuestras no tienen el m nimo de tiempo para legitimarse como saber porque estamos en una encrucijada en la cual decir comunicaci n hoy es decir una palabra absolutamente clave de la modernizaci n del mundo de la configuraci n de las sociedades modernas
2509561 nuestro reto est en darnos cuenta de que juntar comunicaci n y periodismo es juntar dos cosas que hoy d a tienen muy poco que ver porque del periodismo se puede hacer una historia muy corta a trav s de dos modelos por un lado est el de periodismo como espacio de debate propio del siglo xix y por otro lado aparece el modelo period stico norteamericano que hace de la informaci n el objetivo de un peri dico como espacio en donde se debat an las concepciones de los social y en el que no hab a partido pol tico por peque o que fuera que no tuviera el suyo hemos pasado a un tipo de periodismo basado en la informaci n
2509562 las facultades de comunicaci n no pueden renunciar a un proyecto de pa s
2509563 todo mundo precisar ir escola de jornalismo claro que n o mas nestes dias quando a maioria das reda es n o investe muito tempo em treinamento as escolas n o s o irrelevantes a quest o ent o o que os jornalistas precisam saber e quanto se pode esperar que as escolas ensinem

2509580 o primeiro problema para o jornalismo de precis o no brasil ser superar um sistema muito r gido que feito para resistir inova o a maior barreira que vejo de minha perspectiva norte americana a lei que exige que os jornalistas sejam formados em escolas de jornalismo essa lei d s escolas um mercado garantido e as priva do incentivo de fazer melhor as coisas sem a lei as escolas teriam que visivelmente adicionar valor s habilidades existentes de seus estudantes para que pudessem sobreviver uma escola profissional deve ser a fonte da inova o e do desenvolvimento para a profiss o a que serve mas com um mercado cativo n o h necessidade de que ela fa a nada al m de assinar certificados de conclus o

2509587 no georgia i believe started a war in southern ossetia and we are responsible to keep the peace
2509588 we have been appreciative of the american efforts to pacify the hawks in tbilisi apparently these efforts have not succeeded quite a number of officials in washignton were really shocked when all this happened
2509589 the war in ossetia instantly showed the idiocy of our state management
2509590 to do a creeping annexation of south ossetia and abkhazia and secondly to overthrow saakashvili who is a tremendous thorn in their side
2509591 we deplore todays russian attacks by strategic bombers and missiles which are threatening civilian lives
2509592 to provide assistance to the russian troops in case the situation gets more aggravated in the conflict zones in abkhazia and south ossetia
2509593 es ist lobenswert dass microsoft vermehrt auf eine offene kommunikationspolitik in bezug auf informationssicherheit setzt

2509600 first i reject any plan to bulldoze the diamond and eliminate any baseball stadium from the current area indeed that would be tantamount to the wilder administration having driven baseball out of richmond as there is no other viable location for a triple aaa or double aa stadium in the city
2509601 it allows you to connect with people of the same interest meet people with different interest engage in interesting conversation as well as being a great networking tool

2509603 gee if id only fallen off that cliff when i was backpacking and broken my leg id of made some money on that dang health insurance policy
2509604 my theory is that if you look confident you can pull off anything even if you have no clue what youre doing
2509605 well i bet they wont do that again kids eh but did you see you abashed they looked how cute is that look at shawnie with his hands in his pockets and little kelly shuffling his feet

2509614 we are in a bubble and we could see house prices tumble by upwards of 30 per cent and commodities fall by similar amounts gerard minack of jp morgan said
2509615 australians have been living on excess for many years spending too much on property on credit cards on everything
2509616 now they are so overstretched that if unemployment rises like it looks like it will then the bubble is ready to burst
2509617 defaults will rise and that will have a contagious effect on house prices
2509618 people keep saying china will save the day but demand from china is already softening and china is only part of the story anyway
2509619 the rest of the world is slowing sharply and that will have a big impact on australia
2509620 obviously there are a number of factors that we have to consider at the time of making a rate move
2509621 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time
2509622 the current credit reporting regime does not show how much money people owe or record their recent repayments history
2509623 the majority of people declared bankrupt did not have any defaults listed on their credit file meaning they may be lent more money even though they knew they couldnt repay their bills some may be taking on more debt to repay existing debt deepening the debt trap
2509624 we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected

2509626 a third term was always going to be hard for labor to win
2509627 all through this i was quietly confident that we were on the right track
2509628 i think the sustainability of paul hendersons leadership is really in question
2509629 look at the players hes drafted down the line who are going to be fixtures in the league
2509630 our strategy was to try to hit the longball to win a championship not to sign some midlevel players and get into the playoffs we had to have the patience to build those chips up
2509631 we were younger it would have taken a little longer but i think we would have been a contender
2509632 the second we got garnett we felt there was a legitimate possibility we could contend
2509633 i dont want to make it seem like this was our master plan but our strategy was to build assets and remain opportunistic be looking for what you can do and build build build
2509634 if you do nothing else over time youll build a good team
2509635 ooh look its a house lets give it a hideous makeover
2509636 the government has unveiled a raft of proposals aimed at
2509637 by asking the iraqis to take responsibility for their future and to invest in their own country
2509638 let me be clear we are well over five years into a war in a country that had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
2509639 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring
2509640 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2509641 we could have made historic investments in alternative energy to create millions of american jobs we could have headed off 4 dollar a gallon gas and begun to end the tyranny of oil in our time

2509665 we were unable to take the pictures we wanted because the workmen were in the way and refused to move even though they were asked to do so very politely
2509666 two members of the public entered the memorial garden site without authorisation this morning
2509667 the final construction works at the memorial garden are ongoing and as such the site remains a construction site which is not open to the public this unauthorised entry is therefore a breach of site security and contravenes health amp safety regulations
2509668 staff at the construction site requested the persons to leave the site and an investigation into the incident is being carried out the matter may then be reported to the health amp safety executive

2509676 naming a beer is not an easy thing to do and we didnt think it was appropriate for any single person or group to come up with so it just made logical sense to put it in front of the commander and the crew

2509714 i dont think that dissolving parliament would be the best option for him no one in the country would support the action
2509715 he is left with two options either to face the impeachment motion like a man or resign and go home quietly
2509716 our request for the convening of the national assembly session monday has been accepted and in this session we will be moving a resolution to start the impeachment process
2509717 this is the best i have shot since the world cup usa last year so i am really happy with it

2509723 cities offer a lot of environmental benefits at least compared to the alternatives there are many reasons this is so but they all spring from a fairly basic fact cities are built for people lots of people densely packed sharing resources innovations that encourage or take advantage of that density are likely to make cities more sustainable and innovations that undermine density have a lot of work to do to overcome their inherent environmental disadvantages
2509724 dont push me ill pull you instead and if you push too hard ill pull away
2509725 thank god our paths crossed its truly a pleasure and an honor working with someone who possesses your values and your conviction
2509726 lisa and i really talked it over to come up with what could have been done differently in our purchase and we cant come up with a thing any issues we had are with our listing agent lack of communication but they did sell our house quickly with several others on the market we had an easier time coming up with what you did that impressed us 1 obviously cant be done for all customers 1 promoting our property with other realtors while at the convention in vegas web site photos were huge fun to share with family etc 3 the gifts for move in day 4 always returned our calls quickly punctual on all appointments this is great customer service 5 trying everything to get us in the house we knew you were working with the listing agent etc to try to help convince them to take our contingency once we did get the contingency you kept them in the loop to ensure no surprises
2509727 just a quick note to compliment you on the quality of ive been reading surprise listings all day and your photos and comments are above all others youve shown me how good an mls listing can look

2509732 we the lowly minions of the kids table in order to form a more perfect holiday solemnly vow that we will not seek nor accept invitation to ever join the grownups table
2509733 though you sit in high back chairs that have seat cushions and though your strategic location in the dining room puts you mere steps away from the delicious food in the kitchen
2509734 we shall never forfeit our right to assemble freely around collapsible aluminum tables in the living room as far from the kitchen as the houses architecture allows
2509735 as responsible children teens and grown adults reaching upwards of 34 years in age we kids table peons fully accept the difficulties that come with this challenge
2509736 why young persons should reserve the right to sup together is self evident but lest there be confusion we wish to make the following clear we listened in on your conversations last year and we were frightened
2509737 digestive disorders doctors dead toenails growths parasites detachable pinkie fingers bunions freak squirrel attacks and so on
2509738 dear elders holiday celebrations are not a competition to see whose bodily temple is worshipped by the most maladies seek not to one up great uncle billy who has bubonic plague of the hemorrhoid his is the greatest illness he has won
2509739 furthermore the grownups table could learn from the kids table
2509740 though the temptation to escape the grownups table must be overpowering know that any alien invasion visited upon the kids table made in an attempt to evade tales of your apocalyptic medical nightmares will not be tolerated
2509741 we have chosen as a symbol of our struggle a flag woven from forgotten pilgrims and indians tablecloths stained forever with the cranberry sauce of indifference
2509742 it has been said that a thanksgiving turkey divided against itself cannot stand we the kids table are united as one our unity has been forged in the furnace of neglect and molded into a steel colder and harder than that which comprises the 1970s style folding chairs upon which we sit
2509743 on this thanksgiving day we kids give thanks above all for each other especially the sisters and brothers and cousins and cousins scary boyfriends who feasted with us these many years as secondhand thanksgiving citizens
2509744 without them the holiday experience would be much the lesser
2509745 i swear by almighty god that i will be faithful and bear true allegiance to her majesty queen elizabeth her heirs and successors according to law
2509746 youve never seen the olympics in a market that has such domestic commercial scale
2509747 when the olympics were in los angeles and atlanta the u s market was already fully developed
2509748 the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society
2509749 once the basis which for me governed the disposition of the case was no longer available
2509750 i was thrown back to an independent inquiry of the course of tax legislation and litigation for more than a hundred years for all of that was relevant to a true understanding of the problem presented by this case
2509751 this involved many weeks of study during what is called the summer vacation
2509752 now someones turned up observing correctly that its impossible to have a discussion en blog about things to do with sex gender and feminism because people always end up getting heated and unreasonable i wonder why that could possibly be
2509753 david and fyodor all i meant by that rhetorical question at the end of the post was that it always floors me when information on a topic is freely available and yet some of those arguing dont see any need to avail themselves of it and become better informed about the topic and that that makes some of us a bit cross especially when theres a gender agenda as here
2509754 i think with blogging as with dinner parties one ought to be warned against discussing sex religion or politics unfortunately about 97 of blogging is about one or more of those things
2509755 one thing one should not discuss at dinner parties is whether pirate ship doors are in fact pirate ship doors or actually doors about some other boring kind of ship it can get really ugly
2509756 i hope youre not including me in either side of that discussion fyodor i was just trying to help especially not on the olympian side i cant actually tell who you mean when you say those on the other side people have names for a reason truly i was trying to help
2509757 few things irritate me more than a self selected few talking over the top of the heads of others who happen not to share the fews assumptions and it was clear to me at least that not everyone in that thread was talking about the same thing
2509758 anyone who claims otherwise is obviously a charlatan and in need of a good insert verb here
2509759 i lost my temper at 27 quite badly i now see not because andrew was not understanding but because andrew was being an arse and still is and he still doesnt understand that hes being an arse and a staggeringly offensive arse at that because he is clearly smack bang in the centre of the blindness to his own privilege that is the chief marker of the privileged
2509760 andrew is a symptom not a cause and his presence on that thread has reminded me all too horribly clearly of why women are still second class citizens in 2008 which is why i lost my temper
2509761 i also dont see why one is in any way morally obliged to keep ones contributions to a blog thread down at the lowest common denominator of familiarity with and understanding of the topic
2509762 and why the hell doesnt this ever come up as an issue with other specialist topics like environmentalism economics sociology etc etc etc
2509763 but fyodor so many of us know so many andrews it just gets depressing when you find that despite your best efforts to avoid them they keep cropping up and have the gall to post comments on blog threads i mean really the hide of some people
2509764 im sorry engaged the theory drive which theory exactly neither of the comments cited use anything more than everyday definitions of terms is it because i used the word difference because andrew used it first and i was just expanding on the two different senses which he did and what i thought was wrong with them if you dont like my style thats fine im also willing to accept that i wasnt helping facilitate discussion
2509765 thanks also to fyodor for the restrained and reasonable critique i think you have a good point about my responses to andrew on that thread as for my style well ill work on it
2509766 thats what i liked about fyodors comments they pointed to my actual failures not to some general failure in his life of which i am only a representative
2509767 but i must thank you for that one as you have just broken my all time numbers of comments in a thread record
2509768 and enjoyed what i heard of him reading from his travel book about the us a little while back on radio national
2509769 i refer you to don watson and his every utterance and written word
2509770 this is my original comment about don watson i would love to hear how as you say it is ambiguous and badly written
2509771 it is ambiguous because of its context in this case what went before it which was all about bad writing it would have ceased to be ambiguous if you had said by contrast or this is how its done or some other such it is badly written because it is ambiguous you refer the reader but you do not say why it is also hyperbolic in its reference to dons every utterance i beg leave to suggest that you have not in fact heard his every utterance
2509772 i am not writing an essay for you to mark here
2509773 you dont seem used to or comfortable with dealing with an adversarial adult who is not in the classroom do you
2509774 well you can close ranks with the likes of klaus whoever all you like but my point is his or any blogger you like to names portenous mouse droppings when challenged hardly compare to even one sentence of don watsons why is that do you think
2509775 is anyone else for no special reason suddenly realising how little theyve missed jangari over at lp
2509776 this is about the basic values the u s has always preached
2509777 making movies as distinct from owning libraries of fully amortized films that continue to throw off sizeable profits has gone from a modestly profitable activity to one that now generates substantial losses over the initial release of films to all worldwide markets a period of roughly five years
2509778 im the son of a truck driver and a housewife from a meatpacking town
2509779 who wants to provide a better quality of life for ordinary folks without growing government
2509780 we must be the party of sams club republicans not just country club republicans
2509781 name brand a little damaged and out of fresh ideas
2509782 but we have to recognize that to voters younger than me he is an historical figure
2509783 but we sometimes forget he got things done as governor and president that represented compromises if today you went to someone and outlined reagans record without using his name some conservatives would want to throw him out of the party but he never wavered on core principles and he made the country a better and more conservative place
2509784 we blocked a lot of other taxes by holding fast everywhere else
2509785 climate change is occurring in large measure because of natural cycles but some portion is due to human behavior
2509786 whatever we ultimately do about it shouldnt imperil the economy or cut back on our ability to produce jobs
2509787 we have to dramatically realign health care so patients and doctors are in charge not government or insurance bureaucrats
2509788 you need a business plan that provides access to capital and responds to marketplace needs and sharp competition
2509789 i think hed make a great accompaniment to john mccain
2509790 if he had his druthers hed always do the conservative thing
2509791 but if its a choice between something conservative and something really popular hell often go with the latter
2509792 hes a natural id give him an a minus for navigating minnesotas political waters on issues id give him a b minus or c plus but im a tough grader
2509793 is about the most conservative governor this state could elect theres an old joke that a republican in minnesota couldnt get elected as a democrat in mississippi
2509794 the surge in iraq worked and john mccain was one of the first to call for it
2509795 meant we wound up with two bushes in the white house
2509796 hes thought a lot about the countrys political future and how to adapt conservatism to changing demographics and pressures
2509797 the first non state radio station to have broadcast in china since the communist party took power in 1949
2509798 remains unknown although estimates range from several hundred to several thousand
2509799 no doubt when the chinese government has finished dealing with its people the tidy square will be presented again as a suitable site for tourists visiting dignitaries and the chinese public to come honor the heroes of chinas glorious revolution
2509800 trying to imagine the olympic torch lit in beijing i keep remembering another torch put there not at the behest of the communist regime but by the protesters who nearly 12 years ago rose up by the millions to defy chinas tyranny

2509864 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
