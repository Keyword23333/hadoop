3940017 while it was extremely upsetting to be targeted in such an unpleasant manner and to attract such anger from a complete stranger i felt it was important to take a stand and refuse to allow myself or my family to be intimidated in this manner that is why i decided to involve the police
3940018 i would urge all victims of hate crime and harassment to report their experiences to the police or the councils community safety team so that action can be taken against those people who think it is acceptable to try and intimidate harass or bully others who do not share their bigoted views
3940019 councillor pye and her family were clearly traumatised by the letter every person irrespective of their standing within the community has the right to live peacefully in their homes and should not be subjected to hate crime if a person believes that they or another have been a victim of hate crime the metropolitan police service would encourage them to report the matter

3940101 the evaluation so far shows the court meets international best practice the strength of the waitakere family violence court is the collaboration between government and non government agents
3940102 what it found was that women who seek legal intervention did so as a last resort and having ongoing victim advocacy was critically important the courts success in achieving early guilty pleas was also important to victims
3940103 the research team considers that the court in waitakere is successful in meeting its aims in as much as it provides an intervention into the most intimate relationships and enables victims and their families the opportunity to get the support they need
3940104 responding together an integrated report evaluating the aims of the waitakere family violence court protocols written for the ministry of justice can be found at
3940105 its live on the east coast and in the central time zone which is roughly 81 to 82 of all the households in the united states historically we have always shown the olympics on tape on the west coast
3940106 we have done significant testing or polling on the west coast
3940107 the viewers have repeatedly told us that the vast majority of them well in excess of 80 want to see the olympics when theyre available to see the olympics
3940108 they dont want to see the key events of the day happening at 4 or 5 oclock their time

3940110 i came away with the idea that this is the most perfect place on the planet to drill
3940111 if you knew my background which is electronics you wouldnt be surprised
3940112 i like the challenge of figuring out new gear and as a long time digico fan i was excited to get my hands on the sd7 it has a lot of features that i like in a digital console i like the cleanness of the board the problem with digital consoles in general is that you cant move around enough its not a quality issue its just that on live shows you have to get to a section and hit and then get back out this band has a lot of inputs 72 in fact and this console is flexible enough to route my inputs from pages of information right on the surface thats important to me even though i know how to use snapshots i dont use them this is a fairly straight mix and on this console other than the routing it has faders on top so i can move around quicker i actually like to mix and try new things during the show and this board allows me to do it
3940113 i dont really take advantage of all the processing but im looking past this band to projects down the road in the fall which includes an award show in la in october the sd7 will be my first choice for that
3940114 undoubtedly we must raise the issue ourselves and if necessary with the ukrainian authorities
3940115 we should study the issue more closely if yushchenko is making such statements we can also start looking into the issue properly
3940116 it is by the goodness of god that in our country we have those three unspeakably precious things freedom of speech freedom of conscience and the prudence never to practice either
3940117 no party holds the privilege of dictating to me how i shall vote if loyalty to party is a form of patriotism i am no patriot
3940118 in religion and politics peoples beliefs and convictions are in almost every case gotten at second hand and without examination from authorities who have not themselves examined the questions at issue but have taken them at second hand from other non examiners whose opinions about them were not worth a brass farthing
3940119 a religion that comes of thought and study and deliberate conviction sticks best the revitalized convert who is scared in the direction of heaven because he sees hell yawn suddenly behind him not only regains confidence when his scare is over but is ashamed of himself for being scared and often becomes more hopelessly and malignantly wicked than he was before
3940120 we all live in the protection of certain cowardices which we call our principles
3940121 you cannot have a theory without principles principles is another name for prejudices
3940122 the perfection of wisdom and the end of true philosophy is to proportion our wants to our possessions our ambitions to our capacities we will then be a happy and a virtuous people

3940135 it was a public road and the toll was put on it by the previous coalition government
3940136 we did commit in 1995 to remove the toll the contract prevented us from doing that without massive payment from the taxpayers so we introduced cashback
3940137 in 2010 the concession period ends and the toll is scheduled to come off

3940148 in this age of 4 a gallon gas and staycations we felt that vudu customers deserved a break and should be able to watch a great film for just 99 cents

3940150 it tastes excellent not unlike venison only a different flavour
3940151 sea squirts are absolutely essential to the marine ecosystem and this workshop will be key in developing our knowledge of these little known yet highly important creatures
3940152 the only sea squirts weve seen here im happy to say are native species
3940153 weve not found any invasive or non native species here today and thats all to the good i hope it stays that way
3940154 it was obviously a big disappointment not to reach orbit on this flight 3 of the falcon 1
3940155 utilising straw for biomass represents one of the most efficient methods of its disposal and pre empts the need for it to be ploughed back into the land
3940156 for some time biomass has been seen as the emerging sibling of the renewable energy industry
3940157 no animals eyes are like that the retina is curved
3940158 we released the membrane let it snap back and saw that it puts all the photosensitive chips into compression
3940159 the ribbons pop up forming bridges between the chiplets and so maintain the electrical connections
3940160 the interconnected mesh allows you to stretch deform and reshape the circuit of photoreceptors giving you an undistorted image
3940161 look at the human body there is nothing rigid about it
3940162 the problem is that there is a wide range of underlying defects and we havent got a magic bullet which can target these all at once
3940163 this gene has been associated with a combination of kidney and eye disease in human patients
3940164 here we found a mutation which affects only the eyes suggesting this gene might be a candidate for human patients with eye disease only
3940165 it is a wide spectrum of conditions not just one
3940166 the problem is that there is a wide range of underlying defects and we havent got a magic bullet which can target these all at once
3940167 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
3940168 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
3940169 it is quite spectacular we are just wiping out primates
3940170 the problem with these species is that they have long lives so it takes time to reverse the decline it is quite depressing
3940171 this creates access allowing people to go to places that they could not go in the past
3940172 primates are relatively easy to hunt because they are diurnal live in groups and are noisy they are really easy targets
3940173 many of the asian primates like langurs are 5 10kg so they are a good target generally you find that what is big and easy to get disappears very quickly
3940174 if you kill seven 10 or 20 mountain gorillas it has a devastating impact on the entire population
3940175 within the red list criteria you are allowed to anticipate what will happen in the future as well as look at what has happened in the past
3940176 so it was decided not to change the mountain gorillas listing because of the sudden deaths and we do not know when it is going to stop
3940177 the lion tamarins were almost extinct in the wild but they were very popular in zoos so there was a large captive population decided to join forces to introduce a captive breeding programme to reintroduce the tamarins in brazil
3940178 they were not exposed to eagles or snakes and they did not know how to find food so a lot of them died but some did survive and slowly the numbers began to increase
3940179 it took time money and effort at all levels from the politicians to scientists and volunteers on the ground for just two species
3940180 monkeys and apes are trying to tell us something after all some of the non human primates that share 98 5 of our genetic code can and do talk to us
3940181 if primates are telling us to rescue them they are also sending us a message that will help us rescue ourselves
3940182 after all what has a monkey done for you lately
3940183 how people can torture these poor creatures like they have no brain no nerve endings no feeling is beyond me
3940184 if a mother can kill the child in her own womb what is left of the west to save
3940185 after all what has a monkey done for you lately
3940186 we spend enormous energy and lose precious time by trying to demonstrate the obvious wildlife in its integrity is vital for us
3940187 considering the competition between wild species and humans on a very crowded planet one can ask if there is there room for both of us
3940188 in 2050 the human population will stand at more than nine billion with an increased demand for goods so what does sustainable development really mean
3940189 if a species is there i am firmly convinced that it has a good reason to be should nature be preserved in its entirety meaning all species i say yes without any hesitation
3940190 this we know the earth does not belong to man man belongs to the earth all things are connected like the blood that unites us all man did not weave the web of life he is merely a strand in it whatever he does to the web he does to himself one thing we know our god is also your god the earth is precious to him and to harm the earth is to heap contempt on its creator your destiny is a mystery to us what will happen when the buffalo are all slaughtered the wild horses tamed what will happen when the secret corners of the forest are heavy with the scent of many men and the view of the ripe hills is blotted with talking wires where will the thicket be gone where will the eagle be gone and what is to say goodbye to the swift pony and then hunt the end of living and the beginning of survival
3940191 in 2050 the human population will stand at more than nine billion with an increased demand for goods so what does sustainable development really mean
3940192 is the idea of nature being preserved in its entirety little more than a pipe dream
3940193 we have grown in number to the point where our presence is perceptibly disabling the planet like a disease
3940194 our problem is we only have one pile of bananas
3940195 if a species is there i am firmly convinced that it has a good reason to be should nature be preserved in its entirety meaning all species i say yes without any hesitation

3940206 the curse of the billy goat since 1945 what does baseball or the city of chicago have to lose with a guy who has turned every venture has ever tackled into gold

3940208 hes one that can hold that kick longer than anybody else especially in that last turn
3940209 everybodys popping up to the surface and hes still underwater taking that dolphin kick thats his most dangerous weapon
3940210 we were asked to understand how fish swim so efficiently
3940211 and it seemed like a natural extension to apply this to human swimming
3940212 essentially compare these swimmers to the dolphin assuming that the dolphin is the ultimate swimmer
3940213 and the thing that we found is that michael phelps is able to use his body in a way that is very very different from the other athletes and also seems to be much closer to dolphins than we have seen for any other swimmer
3940214 it seemed pretty obvious to me that kicking underwater seemed to be a lot faster than swimming on the surface
3940215 i probably would have been a good backstroker but not a great one it was something that really kind of changed the way backstroke was swum
3940216 almost 90 percent of all the thrust is coming from the foot
3940217 and the flatter bigger your foot is essentially the bigger paddle you have and thats one of the reasons the fish always beat us because they have extremely large flukes michaels foot size im sure plays a big role in his ability to swim very well
3940218 the best swimmers in the world cant go that far
3940219 they do the dolphin kick but they cant go far because theyve got to take a breath and michaels lungs are so powerful that hes been able to use that as his final weapon off that last turn
3940220 pienso que es esencial que mis fotograf as deban transmitir la emoci n y la personalidad del modelo el xito de una fotograf a a menudo depende de c mo se prepare es importante que el modelo y yo estemos en la misma frecuencia para poder revelar en la imagen la buena vibraci n provocada por la relaci n
3940221 i think its essential that my photographs should convey emotion and personality of the model
3940222 wayt wat two posts in as many days can she do that
3940223 im one of the few people who go to movies just to see the previews of coming attractions i love to see how much the editors can squeeze into to 90 seconds
3940224 i love to work with everybody associated with my records including storyboards and promotion im not a meddler i just want to be part of everything
3940225 i want to create songs that not only relate to my own life but also draw from the experience of my peers
3940226 hey honey we have a housing chrisis in victoria so we thought the best solution was to send all you unwashed masses back to bendigo where you came from and show you how to dig it
3940227 i was a community development worker i have done volunteer work but because im a single mum its this stigma they dont want to rent to you
3940228 i dont know anyone there and its taking 2000 to transport my stuff there
3940229 i wonder why hes so much better than most others its not like everyone else doesnt train as hard

3940234 hospitals like any other human run institution make mistakes but for a long time hospitals have tried to cover that up a little bit
3940235 going public with mistakes and talking with the community about them is a very positive move for hospitals and the community
3940236 if its a really juicy story and a major screwup the word will get out
3940237 then the only question becomes whether you the hospital want to play offense or defense
3940238 doing the right thing is always the right thing to do
3940239 o verdadeiro homem de bem o que cumpre a lei de justi a de amor e de caridade na sua maior pureza se ele interroga a consci ncia sobre seus pr prios atos a si mesmo perguntar se violou essa lei se n o praticou o mal se fez todo o bem que podia se desprezou voluntariamente alguma ocasi o de ser til se ningu m tem qualquer queixa dele enfim se fez a outrem tudo o que desejara lhe fizessem deposita f em deus na sua bondade na sua justi a e na sua sabedoria sabe que sem a sua permiss o nada acontece e se lhe submete vontade em todas as coisas

3940247 natures intent is neither food nor drink nor clothing nor comfort nor anything else in which god is left out whether you like it or not whether you know it or not secretly nature seeks hunts tries to ferret out the track on which god may be found
3940248 your task is not to seek for love but merely to seek and find all the barriers within you yourself that you have built against it
3940249 it is natural for the immature to cause harm to others it is wrong to get angry with them like resenting fire for burning

3940254 when i was five years old i started playing with sk nieuwkerke actually i wasnt allowed to do so because i was too young but my mother wanted that because i had already broken things in our house i played for five years with sk nieuwkerke in one year i scored 130 goals and for two years we were the champions
3940255 when i was noticed by sk gullegem they asked me if i would like to join their team i immediately said yes because then i could play in a provincial team thats on a higher level but in my first year with gullegem the first team didnt succeed in staying in second division this meant that we played the next year in a national division with again better football players however we were the champions also this year i was creamed off for the west flanders selection during a few trainings there were scouts among them from club bruges and moeskroen a few days later lorenzo staelens moeskroen called me up and asked if i would like to join in a training as a test they said that i had satisfied their expectations but one day later club bruges called me up and asked if i would like to join in a training also as a test that was also positive and now i had to choose between moeskroen and bruges

3940265 have you heard of the supplement poly mva it drastically helped a woman that i know of get rid of a brain tumor she had a stage 4 brain tumor with paralysis and after taking poly mva her paralysis was gone and an mri showed that the tumor was gone
3940266 she walked out of the hospital unaided to continue therapy at home
3940267 is attributable to the side effects of the tamoxifen which she continued to take
3940268 glioblastoma patients usually have a dramatic early response similar to mr d age 66
3940269 his tumor inactivated his right leg and foot and caused generalized convulsions which were poorly controlled by tegretol or dilantin i received a phone call from mr d four days after he began lapd i e polymva he said his paralysis was gone and he could walk outside and water the lawn and ride his stationary bicycle eight days after beginning he called again to report that his convulsions were now localized and almost gone
3940270 pain from metastatic breast cancer to the spine and right hip in cf age 56 required a right hip replacement which gave relief from hip pain but did not effect sic the spine she started lapd and within 2 weeks her back pain stopped and she returned to her legal research employment most breast cancer patients report at least temporary improvement
3940271 two cases of cancer of esophagus both required ms morphine sulfate ed for pain relief both were cachectic wasting away ed both were terminal when they started lapd mr g age 62 was in a mexican hospital when he was scheduled to begin the lapd ls age 45 took the lapd for home use mr g died within 6 weeks but an investigation uncovered the fact hat he was never given the lapd he was given laetril sic alone ls reported increased strength and weight gain and is still living 2 years from starting lapd
3940272 i have no signs of any cancer and feel very well
3940273 i am very grateful and hope to carry on this way for many years to come
3940274 i lived abroad for many years in a country awash in superstition i am superstitious in a universal and spiritual sense and will not venture to put into words what has transpired nor will i make mention of my fathers name let it suffice to say that poly mva was gods way of intervening
3940275 there have been recent controversies over possible adverse biological effects of using palladium in dental alloys
3940276 in an ionic form and at sufficiently high concentrations palladium has toxic and allergic effects on biological systems the carcinogenic potential of the palladium ion is still unclear although there is some evidence that it is capable of acting as a mutagen
3940277 a major source of health concern is the sensitization risk of pd palladium ed as very low doses are sufficient to cause allergic reactions in susceptible individuals persons with known nickel allergy may be especially susceptible pd salts may cause primary skin and eye irritations

3940279 radical cancer hysterectomy removed nine lymph nodes one cancerous outside the margin metastasized stage four
3940280 he told me if i left and did nothing id have a 20 percent chance of survival with combined chemo and radiation a 50 percent chance
3940281 i had in my mind i wasnt sure if thats what i needed to do
3940282 everything that god allows to come into the life of one of his children is motivated by gods overwhelming love for us
3940283 mike felt strongly we needed to be careful so we began to research
3940284 hed seen patients with chemotherapy go downhill rather than improve
3940285 his goal was to improve patients survival without jeopardizing their quality of life
3940286 every place i turned in the whole journey god had somebody there
3940287 my a ha moment came when i realized even had i never been diagnosed with cancer im still not assured another day my cancer diagnosis had no bearing over whether i lived or died
3940288 i dont know what the rest of the journey holds but i do know who holds the journey

3940296 das ist phantastisch ich habe es einfach durchgezogen olympiagold ist der traum eines jeden sportlers
3940297 mich pusht das immer sehr wenn ich mit den florett fechtern zusammen einen wettkampf habe wir klatschen uns zwischen den gefechten immer ab
3940298 einen tag hektisch einen tag panisch einen tag weinerlich gestern war ich ziemlich locker heute morgen angespannt am mittag wieder locker die ganze palette an psychologischen und emotionalen regungen rauf und runter ich habe alles durchgemacht

3940301 follow my example as i follow the example of christ
3940302 join together in following my example and just as you have us as a model keep your eyes on those who live as we do
3940303 you know how we lived among you for your sake you became imitators of us and of the lord so you became a model to all the believers
3940304 in order for us to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate
3940305 set an example for the believers in speech in conduct in love in faith and in purity
3940306 in everything set them an example by doing what is good
3940307 the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and knowledge of the holy one is understanding

3940311 aceh punya kualitas ganja dan kuantitas produksi ganja yang cukup istimewa tidak banyak daerah lain di indonesia yang bisa memproduksi ganja seperti halnya aceh saya heran kenapa itu tidak dijadikan sebagai pemasukan untuk anggaran daerah toh sekalipun dilarang juga praktik penanaman ganja masih tetap tidak berkurang di aceh polisi bisa saja menakut nakuti pelaku penanaman ganja penjual atau pembelinya dengan penangkapan dan penjara sekalipun tapi saya tidak yakin mereka akan mampu mengurangi produksi ganja di aceh logika saya begini masih ingat saat kita masih anak anak saat nyoba nyoba merokok sambil sembunyi sembunyi karena takut ketahuan oleh orang tua kita nah ternyata semakin kita terbawa oleh ketakutan malah semakin kita menikmati itu sebagai sebuah tantangan
3940312 tetapi bukankah memang tanaman tersebut sangat ideal dan memang sudah lama memasyarakat dengan masyarkaat kita di aceh bukankah juga tidak kalah baik jika seiring dengan upaya peningkatan ekonomi daerah dari sector lain dengan tidak memubazirkan yang telah ada baca ganja

3940316 it was like if you or i were to commit a murder and say oh my goodness what have we done
3940317 like someone had run round the house and picked up lots of different plastic bags
3940318 there may be some differences of opinion on some issues on major issues such as iran and also the middle east
3940319 but when it comes to anti semitism i think were on the same page
3940320 we mentioned our concerns about anti semitism and asked him what his position was
3940321 and he said he was certainly not an anti semite
3940322 all forms of anti semitism discrimination against minorities and anti muslim sentiment
3940323 the global jewish community is more at peace with president chavez
3940324 there may be some differences of opinion on some issues on major issues such as

3940329 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
3940330 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3940331 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
3940332 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3940333 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3940334 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and of georgia be respected
3940335 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3940336 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3940337 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
3940338 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3940339 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3940340 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3940341 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
3940342 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
3940343 absolute truth is that which is true for all people at all times in all circumstances
3940344 i jumped out of my car and saw bodies in the streets
3940345 wherever i saw a body moving i helped carry them to a car to drive them to the hospital
3940346 there is no religion in the world that accepts such acts
3940347 against the hands that try to disrupt its security and stability
3940348 lebanon and the lebanese will not kneel or submit to the criminals and the terrorists
3940349 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
3940350 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3940351 has brutally pushed this well beyond the bounds of anything that might have related to
3940352 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
3940353 the united states has supported those efforts now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3940354 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
3940355 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3940356 either support for a virtual project or real partnership on issues that really demand collective action
3940357 there are confused reports and varying reports that are coming in
3940358 its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
3940359 experiencing serious microsoft type growing pains with its launch of the new iphone that went on sale two weeks ago
3940360 my belief in the value of detailed written design has often led enthusiasts of agile to assume that i am an adherent of the obsolete and justly maligned waterfall method of software construction i was pleased to have this opportunity to state my position with clarity and precision not to mention making the case for effective collaboration between interaction designers and agile programmers
3940361 is designed for individuals who are not defined by the four walls in their office or home but by a desire to always be connected for work and play no matter their location
3940362 community members can come together to read about other digital nomads and share ideas tips tricks and best practices
3940363 boundaries for businesses are virtual this is a new class of worker who maybe doesnt have an office and who maybe visits 10 offices in a day and visits several different customers
3940364 if you look at india about 67 or more of their workforce is going to be entirely mobile and that is driving the demand for new features in the laptop like all day connectivity long battery life high level security and uncompromising design and durability
3940365 how many times have you been asked this question if you had to choose which would you prefer to be deaf or blind the question illustrates the misconception that deafness is in some way the opposite of blindness as though theres some sort of binary representation of disability when we look at accessible design for the deaf its not surprising to see it addressed in a similar fashion audio captioning is pretty much the equivalent of alt text on images for most designers captioning by itself oversimplifies the matter and fails many deaf people to provide better user experiences for the deaf we need to stop thinking of deafness as simply the inverse of hearing we need to understand deafness from both a cultural and linguistic perspective moreover to enhance the online user experience for the deaf we must understand how deafness influences web accessibility
3940366 one of the difficulties with ethnography as a method for social science research is that its hard to get from a small set of anecdotes to supportable conclusions about a whole set of people
3940367 the real challenge is to move beyond basics to something much more fruitful communal and at times visionary the best brainstorms require a sense of being on the same side and of the freedom to go to the very edge and even topple over it without fear of losing the respect of our peers lets give each other that freedom and lets use it and not hold back if we were sitting with friends at a conference or barroom table what exciting places could we take the discussion what could we achieve how can we inspire each other
3940368 im detail oriented in life so it was a perfect fit for me
3940369 im definitely a morale booster to the crew i like to work with music its your job to keep everybody doing their best and happy to be there
3940370 my shorts about a girl played by laura dern who has a chance encounter on a bus that confirms the decision she makes to be single and reinforces her faith in herself
3940371 i have so many single friends its tough this story speaks to people you dont have to have someone complete you
3940372 she gets approached for projects a lot but she really connected to this she let go and trusted me it brought our friendship even closer
3940373 theres no question maybe ill do another short ill work my way up who knows
3940374 we are contemplating versions of one or two of the cei titles youve mentioned on the wii not saying which but wed like to see how they do on their initial target systems before doubling down on additional skus
3940375 the trend for posting self made videos is driving the number of performances on the websites we license
3940376 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3940377 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3940378 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3940379 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3940380 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
3940381 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
3940382 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited
3940383 i think you can ask the receivers he still has it
3940384 but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3940385 i said look i heard youre not talking to the media
3940386 he said its not that its not that i obviously was joking on that i said look im not here to take chads spot or replace him or whatever it is what it is
3940387 i said this the other day i dont think ive ever beaten chad
3940388 not only a strong chairman of but also a cherished friend and confidant
3940389 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3940390 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3940391 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3940392 of course you have memories of such a big tournament and losing
3940393 hes a good player so im very happy with this win because i think this was the first true test in this tournament
3940394 if hes too good for me hes too good for me
3940395 every time at the beginning of each match ive felt like i could come out on top
3940396 but i was just making so many errors and i wasnt practicing like that at all it came to a point i think i hit a backhand in the net and i had just had enough
3940397 its only every four years so now is the time to really play well
3940398 its looking great for the americans the past couple of days
3940399 it would be great if we could finish up strong here and walk away with a few medals
3940400 i dont understand why we dont play such a big tournament over 10 days maybe i think this is asking just a little bit too much
3940401 from our conversations with our international counterparts in new york milan and paris it has become clear that they do not recognize the need for an international health certificate
3940402 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
3940403 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
3940404 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3940405 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3940406 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3940407 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3940408 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3940409 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3940410 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3940411 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3940412 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
3940413 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
3940414 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3940415 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3940416 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3940417 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3940418 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
3940419 to live without faith without a patrimony to defend without battling constantly for truth is not to live but to get along we must never just get along
3940420 sadness should be banished from all christian souls for suffering is a far different thing from sadness which is the worst disease of all it is almost always caused by lack of faith but the purpose for which we have been created shows us the path along which we should go perhaps strewn with many thorns but not a sad path even in the midst of intense suffering it is one of joy

3940430 while these services will be a powerful force in our lives they are a potential privacy nightmare
3940431 these services are all being sold to consumers as only providing real benefit no one is talking about the fact they are about building and collecting more data not just about the content you like but where you go and where you are at the moment
3940432 this is a way for the user to take their location to the web for every site on the web to become geo aware and to respond to where users are
3940433 switchboard that anyone can build on top of and we are the bit that helps connect to other services out there
3940434 fire eagle is neutral and open and the main thing we do is give people control to choose how much information they want to share and change it at any time
3940435 we only store your current information and dont keep any historical logs that information will stay there until you over ride it or change it
3940436 fire eagles features are beyond our comfort level as far as the average internet users is concerned
3940437 part of the problem is that yahoo cant control what the companies they partner with do with the information
3940438 while this is an opt in service you have to be clear about the consequences of what you are opting in to
3940439 people are social beings and people lie they tell fibs they want to buy presents for their partners go for job interviews and have secret and illicit affairs
3940440 people live rich and varied lives and its not our job to flatten that out we are here to make the world respond to you
3940441 if we get millions of consumers using the service and have thousands of applications we think it will be good for yahoo
3940442 we want our services to be location aware as well and obviously the more consumers that are willing to use it the more we will be able to tailor our services to them and the better it is for us
3940443 advertisers have yet to catch up to the possibility this space offers and fire eagle makes it that more explicit for them so i think we will see more targeted adverts coming into being that can take advantage of a persons location
3940444 oh sorry ive been using the other side to wipe my ass

3940449 wholesale gas prices are linked to the price of oil which has doubled since spring last year

3940508 the protests are the manifestation of an anger that the peace process doesnt seem to have achieved anything
3940509 the peace process has not addressed the concerns of kashmiris they want to see an end to uncertainty they want a resolution of the kashmir dispute
3940510 the protests are serious and should serve as a wake up call
3940511 firing on protesters speaks of indian double standards in jammu three protesters were killed during several days of curfew but in the muslim kashmir valley six people are martyred on the very first day of a curfew
3940512 after these shooting incidents we have lost whatever love we had for indians
3940513 the rising pro freedom protests will definitely give impetus to the freedom struggle
3940514 what we are seeing is the revival of the separatist movement in kashmir which had been in a dying stage
3940515 firing on unarmed civilians will alienate people further and serve the cause of separatists
3940516 we stood up well because we were so young in the middle of the park
3940517 of course for a game of that level you could be worried but i have confidence in them and i must say i have been paid back very well
3940518 we expected a difficult game and we were not disappointed they man marked us all over the pitch and we needed to be patient and not make any mistakes at the back
3940519 we changed a bit tactically at half time but most important they dropped their level a bit to do what they did in the first half to tackle for every ball is of course very difficult and from then on we looked a bit more comfortable
3940520 its a massive mountain to climb its bigger than everest but we take heart from the performance
3940521 i said before that this game isnt just about now but also the future i like what i see of this team we showed we are a good team who can compete with the likes of arsenal
3940522 we go away thinking 2 0 is an unbelievable result because of the performance we put in
3940523 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half
3940524 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

3940642 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3940643 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3940644 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3940645 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3940646 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3940647 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3940648 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3940649 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3940650 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3940651 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3940652 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3940653 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3940672 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3940673 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3940674 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3940686 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3940687 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3940688 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3940693 they dont seem to be doing any good anymore and it appears they are upsetting some people
3940694 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3940695 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3940704 the struggle to defeat the ultra right and turn our country on a positive path will not end with obamas election
3940705 but that step will shift the ground for successful struggles going forward
3940706 one thing is clear none of the peoples struggles from peace to universal health care to an economy that puts main street before wall street will advance if mccain wins in november lets keep our eyes on the prize
3940707 its not too early to think about a running mate
3940708 condoleezza has become active she is campaigning for her candidacy
3940709 with mccain atop ticket talk shifts to spot no 2
3940710 if mccain really wants to have it all to refurbish his maverick image without having to flip flop on the panderings that have tarnished it to galvanize the attention of the press the nation and the world to make a bold play for the center without seriously alienating
3940711 by choosing rice mccain would shackle himself anew to bushs iraq war but its hard to see how those chains could get much tighter than he has already made them rice would fit nicely into mccains view of the war as worth fighting but until donald rumsfelds exit from the pentagon fought clumsily and it would be fairly easy to establish a story line that would cast rice as having been less bushs enabler than a loyal subordinate who nevertheless pushed gently from within for a more reasonable more diplomatic approach
3940712 its true that her record in office has been one of failure
3940713 the new iphone is performing very well on our network

3940725 what is important is to show china and to show beijing to the whole world
3940726 several months ago everyone was talking about tibet but foreigners need to know the truth about china and we believe that through the olympic games the world will know the truth
3940727 to be the most decorated olympian of all time its a pretty cool title

3940738 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight
3940739 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3940740 i have one eye looking very closely at developments back home i speak to people i have family there but im not going to rush anything
3940741 ive been here a long time i have a family here and its not just a case of upping and leaving and going back theres a lot to take into account i know a lot of zimbabwean professionals who are in a similar situation
3940742 i need to be able to go back and set myself up with a job that allows me to provide for my family both my immediate family and the extended family and that is not going to happen overnight
3940743 political stability is essential and other things will fall into place after that but it will take time
3940744 right now the risk takers are already taking up positions
3940745 even the regular man on the street in zimbabwe right now is very entrepreneurial he has to be or otherwise he wont make enough to survive i think that entrepreneurial spirit is going to be carried forward and so people will have to be sharp
3940746 a lot of colleagues and professionals living here in england have already developed their networks back home for me it wouldnt take me more than a few months to go back even if it might take five years for the situation to really turn around or even for the exchange rate to stabilize
3940747 there are many many people who would want to return and contribute to the rebuilding of zimbabwe but there is still uncertainty and a lack of clarity about what role the diaspora would play
3940748 there are people who have been tortured raped people whose families have been killed do they want to return right away without knowing if there will be justice
3940749 i think many people will wait to see how the situation develops to make sure that there is no longer violence that inflation has gone down perhaps it will be one or two years
3940750 i think you will see zimbabweans making new ties testing the water to go back but not leaving everything theyve got here because they cant afford to go back and lose everything full coverage 2008 beijing summer olympics family life airlines listen up give families a break
3940751 ebitda free cash flow and levered free cash flow all showed significant growth in q2 versus 2007 ebitda increased 56 unlevered cash flow was a positive 5 5 m and if i allocated cash interest for the year to q2 levered cash flow is within 1 m of breaking even and that represents significant progress for us syscon revenue is up sequentially by double digits we settled multiple long standing patent infringement lawsuits that will save us several million dollars in outside legal fees on a go forward basis and we have taken actions that are increasing the quality of our revenue and decreasing bad debt all very nice accomplishments for q2 we have a lot of work to do in terms of growing ebitda managing capital expenditures and growing core or direct provisioning and syscon revenue streams and we are working hard to do that
3940752 my tomatoes grow from the soil with no additives those from the eu are picture perfect as if made by michelangelo but mine are better and tastier and you can eat them as they come no chemicals
3940753 that is why i plan to increase hectares under apples medicinal herbs and vegetables in the next two years
3940754 we cannot be a major exporter we cannot compete with others in terms of quantity or price we must look for particular market niches for our indigenous products wine cheese plum brandy and to sell our home grown food to tourists
3940755 the problems are small and fractured estates old and uneducated population dated technology poorly developed market infrastructure unfortunately croatia has never had a farming strategy to address those issues
3940756 they did not find it profitable to work the land and there were no punitive measures for keeping the land unused so it just lay there
3940757 and prepare for the competition once the market is fully open
3940758 but the huge german cheese market for example has only two percent of goat cheese so i do see a big chance to sell our products abroad
3940759 our vegetables are perhaps a bit more pricey but they are home grown freshly picked untreated with chemicals buyers always prefer our own products
3940760 we know we dont produce enough and well always have to import but we want to increase exports to improve the balance
3940761 the eu has lower subsidies for wine therefore it will be a shock which we want to overcome by encouraging people to invest in technology and new vineyards and focus on quality though there is not much time left
3940762 our wine makers face uncertain times with the eu membership but some of them could really benefit the eu has 500 million people so we should find a place there is always room for original local varieties of wine
3940763 as far as red wine goes i would not dream of competing with france or spain
3940764 but grasevina riesling pinot i am sure i can compete with the big producers in quality and price
3940765 i started last september and they only switched my phone lines on two weeks ago
3940766 everything has been a battle since everything has been a fight
3940767 we really must get up to 37 but with the hurdles of civil service the difficulty with getting people through the background checks and just finding qualified applicants the process has been much slower than expected
3940768 half of louisiana is under water and the other half is under indictment
3940769 over the course of many decades louisiana and new orleans have earned a reputation as being exceptionally tolerant of corruption
3940770 this fueled the demise of the local economy as it drove many companies away and kept them away
3940771 the assumption has been that if you want to do business here you need to set aside extra money to grease the wheels
3940772 we have some issues with corruption and bureaucracy but no more than any other urban environment
3940773 we have promised an end to corruption and incompetence in state government make no mistake about it this is a massive first step
3940774 this would rank louisiana among the top u s states for public disclosure rules and enforcement of those rules
3940775 people get so frustrated with the system here that its no wonder they opt to pay their around it
3940776 it was good for me to get that look today

3940791 there were these unique workshops the rent was low and we were able to freely create art here
3940792 people here are more open to our work and they respect us as contemporary artists
3940793 but in other places such as yuanmingyuan and songzhuang where established artists gather our works are often not accepted
3940794 the art district has really degenerated into an art theme park instead of a real soho like art district
3940795 the district has become a fashionable spot with a fake art feel
3940796 one thing is certain the change has begun and big art agencies and some famous brands will eventually replace individual artists here

3940831 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
3940832 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
3940833 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
3940834 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
3940835 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
3940836 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
3940837 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
3940838 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional scene memory become unbound during sleep
3940839 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of

3940856 any new israeli leader of any political party is sure to maintain the usual israeli policies of murder assassination and illegal settlement building
3940857 when a new kadima party chairman is chosen i will resign as prime minister
3940858 israel suffered a number of major setbacks under his leadership especially the defeat in 2006
3940859 was never more than a transitional figure with little impact on israeli foreign policy
3940860 he comes from the military establishment and as a student of sharon he could be the only one with the strength to convince israeli public opinion to make concessions in the peace process
3940861 her lack of military experience and capabilities in contrast to mofaz represents a major weakness
3940862 netanhayus day is over israelis still remember his inability to provide security when he served as pm in the 1990s
3940863 as for the labor party the days of its historic leadership typified by slain israeli pm yitzhak rabin ended long ago all the current party leaders lack the weight of their predecessors
3940864 no matter who takes olmerts place the peace process will continue to face enormous obstacles
3940865 from the arab perspective all the contenders mofaz livni and netanyahu are equally unpropitious
3940866 in any case the arab position on the palestine issue based on the 2002 arab initiative will remain unchanged
3940867 whenever the israelis come under pressure to reach a workable agreement with the arabs they come up with dramatic new distractions like resignations or early elections anything to put off a settlement
3940868 every year they promise the establishment of a palestinian state and every time something happens to derail it
3940869 its obvious the israelis are just killing time in order to maintain the status quo
3940870 a palestinian state will never come into being except by means of armed resistance
3940871 the situation in georgia remains fluid and dangerous as soon as possible my colleagues senators lieberman and graham will be traveling to georgia theyre both members of the senate armed services committee i hope that other members of the armed services committee in the senate will go together
3940872 as a man of action during a time of international crisis and to remind people that the world is a dangerous place thats still filled with aggressive actors something that the mccain camp presumably thinks will play in his favor
3940873 also seems designed to shoulder bush aside as the primary gop leadership figure here
3940874 the role of the u s military is strictly to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims of this conflict
3940875 the events of the last few days show that there are many places in the world where we dont necessarily anticipate this kind of conflicts breaking out
3940876 and it does require a steady hand on the tiller and an experienced one
3940877 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
3940878 there are real stakes and real penalties associated with poorly handled discovery in the past few years we have seen cases where defendants have faced jail time and millions of dollars in sanctions or penalties
3940879 strategic steps should be taken so that electronic discovery can be handled correctly
3940880 what were trying to emphasize here is you dont dump an athlete because he or she didnt fare well in the sea games

3940884 lisa i think you and biglaw could be sooo happy together you have the same old world tastes love for the finer things in life desire for global domination and resentment of small children its so perfect
3940885 omg i cannot believe how much biglaw and i have in common we went to dinner at
3940886 man summer associate is so refreshing she is so excited about the simplest luxuries and eager to spend long hours with me she is sooo impressed by my office space sophisticated practice areas and international clients she wants me

3940888 after two years in a committed relationship with big firm i just feel like he doesnt listen to me anymore he is all about his needs but he never asks me what i want anymore its just become so routine bill bill bill no more fine dining no paul simon concerts no flowers would he even care if i just left what happened i miss the good old days
3940889 i dont even love him anymore but at least i know his flaws i am too old to get back out there i am comfortable with him he is stable and provides a good life for me ill just have to show him i am worth the commitment i will bill more hours
3940890 tegen 4 uur waren we terug uit het ziekenhuis waar dr gans ons de bevindingen en verdere behandelvoorstellen heeft uitgelegd
3940891 first to paraphrase harbert corporations opposition by no rational definition of the term do fifty two attorneys constitute a small team of lawyers
3940892 this court heartily agrees that relators counsel generally and the more junior team members in particular performed at a consistently high standard throughout this litigation but as this court observed above wilmer hales established billing rates are reasonable precisely because they align with those of other highly skilled attorneys in the district of columbia legal community simply put these superstars already bill at superstar rates
3940893 do i feel that he betrayed me i dont like the word betrayal i think he was in denial himself he did a very very stupid bad thing
3940894 i paid for them to relocate to another home in another state
3940895 i never discussed it with john he was on the campaign trail in iowa at the time
3940896 well be working side by side with dewey amp leboeuf to litigate the claims with dewey taking the lead
3940897 there arent a lot of slcs and often when they are formed they seek to dismiss instead of run the litigation
3940898 obviously we were pushing to be a lot more aggressive with larry sonsini
3940899 on the other hand they received that recovery without having to initiate litigation that wouldve cost brocade even more
3940900 engaged in the rank commercialization of mr trumps reputation and unyielding demand for excellence all in patent effort to solicit new clients and preserve existing ones simply based on defendants having represented the world renowned donald j trump
3940901 we expect to be paid no matter who you are
3940902 keep the law firm of carolina amp morgan going in his carolinas memory and to continue to help others as andre did
3940903 this was merely an attempt to bring qualified candidates to the attention of the jncs
3940904 there was never any discussion of trying to influence the jnc members
3940905 anyone who championed an ideological litmus test over a commitment to independent judicial values would be an inappropriate judicial candidate
3940906 clearly the pattern of defendant feltons conduct in the instant action is subject to costs and sanctions
3940907 ms feltons intransigent conduct demonstrated by her refusal to return the down payment with the accrued and statutory interest to plaintiff compelled plaintiff to commence the instant action and motion practice
3940908 your honor may i ask the court to compel ms felton to deliver the check she has put in her pocket
3940909 ms felton will you be willing to hand over the 30 438 81 check
3940910 in the instant action a reasonable attorney would have refunded plaintiff her down payment after the real estate contract was unable to close
3940911 further a reasonable attorney would not make material misrepresentations to the court comply with court orders that are not stayed and not subject the reasonable attorney from being found in contempt for willful failure to comply with court orders it is clear that ms feltons course of conduct in the instant action is not reasonable
3940912 this is a judge who has an ax to grind
3940913 where as here the plaintiff has requested certain relief the defendant has objected to the grant of such relief and the court has granted the requested relief at least in part it borders on the frivolous to deny that a court ordered change has occurred
3940914 there is nothing in the opinion that can be read as rejecting or calling into question the courts original conclusion that there is a sincere heavy likelihood in this case that
3940915 as the party seeking fees it was trudeaus responsibility to demonstrate his entitlement by explaining the relevance of the time entries he has not done so
3940916 the court cannot comb through the legal invoices on its own and determine without input from the parties which hours were related to successful portions of trudeaus lawsuit and which hours were spent in pursuit of failed endeavors
3940917 engaged in deceit and trickery to keep the criminal investigation concealed
3940918 strategy to conceal the criminal investigation from defendants was an abuse of the investigative process
3940919 alerts sec investigative witnesses that the information can be used in a criminal proceeding defendants were on sufficient notice of that fact and so were their attorneys
3940920 the sec made no affirmative misrepresentations the sec did advise defendants of the possibility of criminal prosecution the sec engaged in no tricks to deceive defendants into believing that the investigation was exclusively civil in nature
3940921 summary judgment will be denied and treasury will be given an opportunity to explain the parameters of its search to assure that it was adequate to find responsive documents
3940922 with respect to the asserted exemptions treasurys withholding of the documents with the exception of a few was proper
3940923 lacking the specifics of how the search was conducted one cannot determine whether it was reasonably calculated to discover responsive documents
3940924 it may be that treasurys search was adequate but there is insufficient information in the record to conclude that it was therefore treasury will be given the opportunity to specify its search methodology
3940925 here there is no evidence of bad faith the length of time in responding to the requests was not inordinate considering the number of agencies involved the nature of the information sought the volume of documents to be searched and reviewed and the sensitivity of many of those documents
3940926 throughout the process even though they disagreed the parties communicated regarding progress treasury did not intentionally refuse to process the requests it sought to refine them so it could respond

3940985 im absolutely sick for a guy like dominique who is a senior and has really busted his tail
3940986 he put his heart soul and energy into the winter workouts the spring and the summer i know that hes really devastated but hes part of a big family right now and everybody is going to kind of put their arm around him were just going to have to wait and see where this thing goes after the surgery
3940987 i know we have lots of guys banged up right now and those do pile up as we get into two a days
3940988 fred hicks is slowly coming back from a nagging ankle injury but he has really been limited up to this point as to what he can do linval joseph has also really been limited in what he can do coming off his back surgery at this point we just dont know how much well have them early in the season
3940989 i am now recognising in both the one dayers and the tests i am one of the more senior players and that i need to go out and play like that
3940990 its an exciting thing for me to be seen as one of the senior players and to go out there and have a responsibility to deliver its a role im looking forward to having for a while to try to lead by example
3940991 its something i want to do as i have played enough test matches i have made a switch in the batting order from five to three and there is an opportunity to cement my place
3940992 if your verizon cell phone works at the location so will the usb720 modem
3940993 you cant believe it you cant conceive it and you cant touch me cause im untouchable
3940994 i swear to god bourdin looks exactly like francisco hernandez fernandez
3940995 when he talked in spanish he became a spaniard when he talked in english he was an englishman
3940996 an incredible illusionist whose perversity is matched only by his intelligence
3940997 in my twenty two years on the job ive never seen a case like it
3940998 usually people con for money his profit seems to have been purely emotional
3940999 it was as if he were trying to find a new character to inhabit
3941000 i dont want you to make me into somebody im not
3941001 i will tell you the truth behind all my lies
3941002 she liked to drink and dance and stay out at night she didnt want anything to do with that child
3941003 you are my son and they stole you from me at the age of two they did everything to separate us from each other and we have become two strangers
3941004 he had this way of making you connect to him
3941005 i dreamed they would send me to england where i always imagined life was more beautiful
3941006 we find ourselves confronted with a young runaway teen mute having broken with his former life
3941007 i would rather leave on my own than be taken away
3941008 id been in shelters and foster homes most of my life and suddenly i was told thats it
3941009 the mute adolescent who appeared out of nowhere has still not revealed his secret
3941010 it was fr d ric playing one of his cruel games
3941011 whats this boys name michael j rgen kevin or pedro whats his real age thirteen fourteen fifteen
3941012 actor of life and an apostle of a new philosophy of human identity
3941013 the one thing you better not forget is your name
3941014 i know i can be cruel but i dont want to become a monster
3941015 people always say to me why dont you become an actor
3941016 i think i would be a very good actor like arnold schwarzenegger or sylvester stallone but i dont want to play somebody i want to be somebody
3941017 a white t shirt purple pants black tennis shoes and carrying a pink backpack
3941018 i have some good news nicholas barclay is standing right beside me
3941019 she was maybe the most functioning drug addict we had nice things a nice place never went without food
3941020 my daughter has the best heart and is so easy to manipulate
3941021 he was just sitting by my mom talking to my son
3941022 i work nights and didnt think it was good to leave him alone
3941023 we didnt have no internet or stuff like that you can walk all the way to san antonio before you get any kind of communication
3941024 its really good to have my family and be home again
3941025 it was a psychological need today i wouldnt do it
3941026 zoom in on his ears get em as close as you can
3941027 the boy who came back claiming to be nicholas barclay is nicholas barclay
3941028 family is upset but maintains that they believe it is their son
3941029 i thought he was a terrorist i swear to god
3941030 id set up on the apartment and watch him come out
3941031 he would walk all the way to the bus stop wearing his walkman and doing his michael jackson moves
3941032 i was not used to being in someone elses family to live with them like im one of theirs
3941033 tired of the schemes the lies are disgusting somebody please have mercy cause i just cant take it
3941034 when you fight monsters be careful that in the process you do not become one
3941035 my days are phantom days each one the shadow of a hope my real life never was begun nor any of my real deeds done
3941036 jason worried that he would never meet somebody and he would always be alone
3941037 drinking and scream ing at him because her other son ran away
3941038 messed jason up pretty bad he went on a bad drug binge and was shooting cocaine for a long time
3941039 it was like he had to give it to me
3941040 it was clear that jason knew what had happened to nicholas
3941041 his hair was dark but bleached blond and the roots were quite obvious
3941042 beverly said how dare you say hes not my son
3941043 i go to her house to get a blood sample and she lies on the floor and says shes not going to get up
3941044 i know that god punished me by sending you to me i dont know who the hell you are why the fuck are you doing this
3941045 i raise my pants so he can see im not wearing a gun
3941046 im fr d ric bourdin and im wanted by interpol
3941047 he tells ninety nine lies and maybe the one hundredth is the truth but you dont know
3941048 i wanted to know what had happened to that little kid
3941049 i said mom do whatever they ask you to do go take the lie detector test you didnt kill nicholas so she did
3941050 i said heres your brother long gone kidnapped and arent you eager to see him
3941051 involved in nicholass disappearance or had information that could tell us what had happened
3941052 i dont think you meant to do it but you did
3941053 i dont know why i liked her but i did she had this thousand yard stare she looked like someone whose life had taken everything out of her
3941054 if i went with my gut i would have known right away
3941055 i worked my ass off to raise my kids why would i do something to my kids
3941056 im not a violent person they didnt talk to any of my friends or associates it was just a shot in the dark to see if id admit something
3941057 im the worlds worst liar i cant lie worth crap
3941058 totally wacko a completely different person and it was scary
3941059 we just kept making excuses that hes different because of all this ugly stuff that had happened
3941060 i couldnt bond with him i just didnt have that feeling my heart went out for him but not like a mothers would the kids a mess and its sad and i wouldnt wish that on anybody
3941061 his teeth were different his voice was different his ears were smaller
3941062 one thing a mother ought to know was the identity of her child
3941063 he has lied and lied and lied again and to this day he continues to lie he bears no remorse
3941064 i feel sorry for him you know we got to know him and this kid has been through hell he has a lot of nervous habits
3941065 he did a lot of things that took a lot of guts if you think about it
3941066 i apologize to all the people in my past for what i have done i wish i wish that you believe me but i know its impossible
3941067 i told him what interests me in his life wasnt the way he bent the truth but why he did that and the things that he looked for
3941068 youre not a dad for six days or six months it is not a character it is a reality
3941069 the prognosis seems more than worrying we are very pessimistic about modifying these personality traits
3941070 when confronted with his misconduct the psychopath has enough false sincerity and apparent remorse that he renews hope and trust among his accusers
3941071 ive seen him now for two years and he is not that person
3941072 it doesnt matter i dont need my child to be perfect all i want is that this child feels love
3941073 i was shocked a little bit shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby but im sure my boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3941074 i get mad if the maid does all the housework if she takes it all into her own hands well whats for me to do im a cleaning fanatic dusting is my favorite and windex ing
3941075 i do usually the maid and i will cook together sean and jayden love my spaghetti
3941076 id rather not but but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3941077 we hebben met de speler een akkoord bereikt over een verlengd verblijf voor de komende vijf seizoenen
3941078 we remain concerned that the personal information gathered through the 2011 census could be subject to the united states patriot act and therefore we ask the government to take clear legal advice and advice from the us state department and to publish it in response to this report
3941079 your destructive vehicle and scores of others across oxford has been disabled as part of a wider struggle to a vertaglobal emergency
3941080 as always he is holding his cards close and waiting for more information
3941081 now these men can get back to doing the work they love
3941082 our family today still feels that the ruling just proves again that the justice system here in new orleans is still flawed
3941083 the danziger case is yet another example of a police department in crisis and a criminal justice system unwilling to keep them in check
3941084 los m dicos est n viendo y hablan en principio de como m nimo 40 horas
3941085 se encontraron vainas de distintos calibres que nos hacen presumir hasta ahora la utilizaci n de dos armas de fuego
3941086 la descripci n que hizo el gobernador daniel scioli fue clara en torno a que tiene todas las caracter sticas de un crimen mafioso
3941087 they imposed a very physical game on us with man marking all over the pitch they did that with a lot of belief and spirit
3941088 in the first half they had some chances but in the second half we slowly took over
3941089 they have given so much in the first half they could not keep the same pace and tightness in their marking from then on we looked more comfortable
3941090 we were a very young team and we did not lose our nerve did not panic
3941091 in the end maybe our technical superiority allowed us to score two goals that is a massive advantage for the second leg but we will be on our toes
3941092 i think we should have scored in the first half
3941093 you dont get many chances and you have to take them we didnt do that we lost concentration on two occasions and got punished
3941094 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half
3941095 i still dont know we will have to see it on tv because its much easier to see the important thing is we got a result and we have to improve for the second leg
3941096 the housing market looks good for birmingham when you look at the national prices you are typically looking at areas such as new york and california those are the places seeing those types of hits
3941097 here we do not see those same kinds of drastic hits what we do see here is maybe a 2 to 3 percent difference in listing prices now versus listing prices in january
3941098 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy
3941099 ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3941100 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating
3941101 now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3941102 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3941103 i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3941104 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3941105 your task o roman is to rule and bring to men the arts of government to impose upon them the arts of peace to spare those who submit to subdue the arrogant
3941106 after a 10 month lull we have recorded avian influenza outbreaks in two northern states and laboratory analysis showed that the virus belongs to the sub type related to a different kind of bird flu that is found in europe
3941107 it is likely the new strain might have been introduced to the country by migratory birds
3941108 it is not easy to read as many books as i used to buy
3941109 zhang and colleagues interpret their finding the in framework of the nearly neutral theory
3941110 during the torch relay in tibet and in climbing mount everest if anyone should attempt to disrupt or undermine the torch relay then they will be dealt with severely according to the law
3941111 happy to see these protests going on and im particularly happy to see them happening in so many different nations
3941112 this is a big problem considering that half of the land mass of china and i think most of the resources are minority occupied
3941113 liberty lives first in our minds and when we casually accept its destruction for others we let that flame burn out so i hope the protests continue
3941114 as for tibet being a theocratcy look at butan there an election is being held to determine the fate of thier monarchy the unpopular king could but ousted not by the bullet but by the ballot
3941115 we knew it would be a tough task but we got more than we bargained for
3941116 with electrical surges hard drive crashes high seas vocal ailments and other rock boat shenanigans we all had doubts about whether or not wed be able to pull it off thankfully we didnt give up and the band played on
3941117 north dakota is a great choice for a student that wants a great college experience a great education and a great name behind that education every prospective employer ive ever talked to is impressed with the north dakota so going out into the world i not only feel like ive had a wonderful college experience but i know that the education i acquired will help me with the next step in my career
3941118 this is a highly spirited university we value creativity we value innovation and we have a very high spirit of entrepreneurship those traits pervade all of our academic programs all the way through our clubs and organizations our service programs and our highly competitive athletic teams
3941119 im most proud of the music program were a big music school the biggest in the united states but just because its big doesnt mean the professors are impersonal they basically have an open door policy where theyre always available to talk everyones just so friendly on campus you would think with a population of over 34 000 that you wouldnt get that but youd be surprised
3941120 the reasons to come here are many but they really come down to our emphasis on being a student centered environment we are a large university meaning were very comprehensive and theres something for everybody were close to a large metropolitan area but we are a small college town so students get the college experience and the old fashioned small town environment theres just an incredible array of academic programs for students but we really do pay a lot of attention to whats going on in their lives and what theyre going to do after college
3941121 youre not just a number at uni and you cant really get lost even though there are about 12 000 students here youre recognizable to somebody on campus whether its because you play on a sports team or you regularly eat in a certain dining hall its impossible to feel like nobody cares about you because you will very easily find your niche
3941122 the combination of the strong catholic presence the dominant reputation of athletics the friendly student body the loyal alumni support and the importance of academics all contribute to making notre dame a unique university as a student athlete i am honored to wear the notre dame uniform and represent the university to the best of my ability i will forever be proud to be a part of the notre dame family
3941123 you will find at notre dame just like at other prominent universities a superb undergraduate curriculum and growing strength in research and graduate studies but in addition our catholic character provides the framework of faith a sense of the moral purpose of education and a pervasive experience of community add to that the excitement of the most storied football program in the nation along with other nationally prominent athletic teams and you have a collegiate experience unlike any other
3941124 the best reason is our location were five miles from the beach being a marine biology major there are lots of opportunities for research
3941125 racist organizations right wing militias nra life members and above all those who hate paying taxes so much it should scare the hell out of you
3941126 whos got the ready cash in this country to be able to pay for a heart bypass or hip replacement out of pocket
3941127 regardless of what the media tell us most white americans are not going to believe that they are at fault for what blacks have done to cities across america
3941128 im not speaking for everyone but a lot of us consider the positions of that party to be fairly repulsive why would we vote for the standard bearer of those positions
3941129 with democrats and republicans both intent on increasing government intrusion into the lives of those whom government is supposed to serve rather than control
3941130 with microsoft and google both intent on increasing company intrusion into the lives of those whom company is supposed to serve rather than control
3941131 heres to the international communist capitalist conspiracy to which ive always wanted to belong
3941132 so please whoever you are dont renew my subscription to that awful magazine
3941133 i am going to be able to hire a lawyer and beat a company with an army of lawyers and billions to spend
3941134 the purpose of the universe is to make me rich
3941135 i have the liberty to get rich and you have the liberty to starve
3941136 pleased with their rise in the world and wonder why everyone beneath them are such lazy handout grubbing slackers
3941137 not initiating force or fraud against the life liberty or property of another human being
3941138 history shows that intellectuals philosophers scientists historians usually have more foresight on these matters than traditional politicians
3941139 pharyngula is supposed to be a science blog and yet comments on peer reviewed research usually number less than a dozen while any chance to bash libertarians easily draws gt 100 comments
3941140 and its not greedy to suggest that i should be able to decide what i want to do with my money its mine not yours if you want to save the world with your money thats just great but please keep your mitts off mine i have no sense of obligation to support people on welfare or the old guy next door that needs a hip replacement im not some sort of sociopath i know that some people that really need welfare do get off of it eventually a la bill clintons plan the others are just milking the system hey thats my milk money man hands off
3941141 scary as ron paul is his zealots are even scarier i am deeply suspicious of any candidate that provokes that level of mouth foaming fanaticism
3941142 whats the message here support hillary because shes a woman support barack because hes 50 african support john edwards because ok you got me there channeling fetuses
3941143 the issue with paper is that it allows the institution running the mint to inflate the supply at will and this is pauls issue with fiat currency
3941144 i agree with somalia except that is anarcho capitalist for a true libertarian society see the ivory coast
3941145 does anyone here believe that the kind of growth demographic and economic observed in the 20th century is at all sustainable in the 21st century
3941146 one of the main problem with libertarianism is that it needs growth more than any other system and growth there will not be much left whether we like it or not
3941147 people like mikko sandt believe in the sanctity of free markets and have stopped thinking about economics and politics 30 years ago
3941148 the same mossad that bravely got vengeance on the despicable mad arabs that kidnapped the israeli olympians
3941149 but go ahead keep patting each other on the back for mischaracterizing paul and libertarianism and how right you are for what a terrible person he is
3941150 the issue with paper is that it allows the institution running the mint to inflate the supply at will and this is pauls issue with fiat currency
3941151 it was unidentified flying object ok its like its unidentified i saw something
3941152 saying that we cannot continuously grow at the rate that we currently are is not a
3941153 hey things look okay to me now so they will obviously continue to be okay indefinitely
3941154 if the world were just so everybody would be happy
3941155 do you think concern trolling adds anything to the discussion
3941156 so then you will let the morons speak for you because you felt hurt by not being able to express yourself more clearly
3941157 you not only dont understand what a concern troll is you dont understand what an ad hominem argument is either
3941158 a concern troll is a pseudonym created by a user whose point of view is opposed to the one that the users sockpuppet claims to hold
3941159 im waiting for a shred of historical proof that a government created a free prosperous and fair society by taking more power and wealth from its people
3941160 do you not see how petty vindictive misdirected behavior like this could sink the whole libertarian ideal
3941161 i suppose its entirely possible that not every ron paul supporter is a lunatic but honestly i cant think of any lunatics who arent also ron paul supporters
3941162 thats what i thought balance of powers and all that its probably better to elect someone who does not agree with the judiciary and with congress all the time if all the decisions are made before the citizens get a chance to hear about them or say anything then what we have is the same as authoritarianism some commenters here actually want that i guess id rather not live in a country where some random lying cheating asshole gets in power and then assumes ive given him or her a power of attorney over myself sorry
3941163 so then you will let the morons speak for you because you felt hurt by not being able to express yourself more clearly
3941164 a concern troll is a pseudonym created by a user whose point of view is opposed to the one that the users sockpuppet claims to hold
3941165 a more subtle beast than your standard troll this species posts comments that appear to be sympathetic to the topic being discussed but who in reality wishes to sow doubt in the minds of readers
3941166 it would behoove you to understand why so many people associate such ideas with such characteristics
3941167 everytime i exude the slightest whiff of even a small l libertarian idea the only direct responses are
3941168 to claim that somehow only libertarians are able to check the growing power of the government is patently absurd
3941169 i cant find even one instance of someone calling someone else a whiner or childish because of a disagreement over a characterization
3941170 i cant find even one instance of someone calling someone else a whiner or childish because of a disagreement over a characterization
3941171 eighty one percent of israelis support the jewish national funds long held policy of selling land only to jews according to a poll released thursday only 10 oppose the policy while 9 are undecided or refused to answer
3941172 this poll shows that when it comes to the actual land of israel israelis are definitely not liberal
3941173 it doesnt work as well as it could work if we actually cared about its implementation so it must be destroyed 111eleventyone11
3941174 or do you think the united states of america cant do what other smaller countries have done well do you do you understand what a burden would be lifted off our randian supermen of production to have it
3941175 under a libertarian system there is nothing stopping someone from getting a monopoly on food then with holding the food from anyone they dont like this could be for whatever reasons be they racist sexist or religious a libertarian government would be obliged to protect the person with the food even if it means that millions would die and food would rot
3941176 your way of thinking is bizarre the health care systems of the european countries dont compete with each other and yes if any of them turns out to be best which as you note hasnt happened so far the eu should be lobbied to make all its members adopt it
3941177 greedy self centered poor hating stingy and lack ing compassion
3941178 the solution is not libertarianism but the control of money driven corruption in government
3941179 a it attracts those who are more likely to abuse power b you can never have enough internal policing to effectively combat money driven corruption c with the bureaucracy firmly entrenched it will become ever more resistant to those attempts at stamping out money driver corruption
3941180 ok fess up some of you know that i thoroughly detest jews that reactionary political movement that seeks to elevate greed and selfishness as a ruling principle and i suspect one of you got me a subscription to jewish world review magazine a few months ago just to taunt me if your goal was to persuade me to come over to the side of unbridled anti social self centeredness you failed the issue comes i glance through it find a few little bits and pieces i can agree with but because theyre all imbedded in this thick tarry fecal sludge of jewishness i end up throwing the whole thing away in disgust
3941181 thank you jim for a nearly perfect description of corporate culture
3941182 if you have capitalism you will have poor people thats not just a historical fact it is how the system is suppose to work
3941183 your way of thinking is bizarre the health care systems of the european countries dont compete with each other and yes if any of them turns out to be best which as you note hasnt happened so far the eu should be lobbied to make all its members adopt it
3941184 x is a genius so s he must be right
3941185 x is wrong and therefore shown to be a moron
3941186 greedy self centered poor hating stingy and lack ing compassion
3941187 this is a chickenshit dodge you say monopolies are creations of the state not of markets theres no reason for anyone to engage with anyone who makes such a ridiculous claim youve ruled yourself out as a good faith contributor
3941188 what isnt clear at all is why people without any significant property you know the majority of the world would want libertarian government you can talk all you want about rights and liberties but people want to have something to eat and somewhere to live and unless you do something to make those things happen then you have a bad political ideology
3941189 it seems we can look to other things perhaps people having enough to eat before we look to efficiency
3941190 you say monopolies are creations of the state not of markets theres no reason for anyone to engage with anyone who makes such a ridiculous claim youve ruled yourself out as a good faith contributor
3941191 i dont think rich people should be forced to give to poor because they worked hard to legally get rich the democrats dont agree with that
3941192 workers are not allowed to organize to sell their labor to their advantage in a
3941193 she did have very good points about how corporations swoop in after disasters and get billion dollar contracts and sweet deals without any public input
3941194 employers generally white men would be free to hire and fire people based on their race or sex with no ramifications
3941195 now that is obviously a good thing if you argue that having relations with them allows them to continue mistreating their population in perpetuity
3941196 i believe natural monopolies are very rare at best even in the most capital intensive industries with the highest entry costs on closer examination the state will be found to have subsidized the most capital intensive forms of production and other inducements to excessive firm size
3941197 and ron paul is actually more of a federalist than a libertarian to begin with
3941198 furthermore because of monopolies created by the junta many small and medium sized businesses went bust or were severely curtailed adding to the general economic malaise of the working class

3941207 on the other hand most consequentialist defenses of anarchy are purely speculative in forging responses to how a stateless society could cope with every conceivable contingency it might confront anarchists often offer imaginative conjecture in some cases bordering on science fiction

3941222 our increased profit after tax guidance is indicative of our ability to manage our business throughout the economic cycle in particular in times of slower consumer spending which we have experienced in the third quarter and particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 chief executive mark mcinnes said
3941223 all states showed a softening in sales growth in the second half with the fourth quarter being notable for its volatility mr mcinnes said
3941224 very challenging but trading picked up in july due to a combination of school holidays and cold weather
3941225 we were anticipating a slowdown and had started planning for it more than 18 months ago mr mcinnes said
3941226 as part of the planning process we ensured that each key component of our business was prepared for a soft retail environment
3941227 this means we are well placed to deliver our gross profit margins within our target range of 39 5 per cent to 40 per cent throughout fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2012 mr mcinnes said
3941228 utilised the month of july to clear out any remaining surplus winter stock mr mcinnes said
3941229 we are now in the position of our year end stock in 2008 being eight per cent lower than in fiscal 2007 which means we have a very clean inventory position entering into into fiscal 2009
3941230 as we had expected we experienced volatile retail conditions in the second half mr mcinnes said
3941231 we have a proven business model a strong cash position clean inventory levels an established cost efficiencies program and opportunities for growth
3941232 we believe our company has a bright future and that we are well positioned to continue our track record of delivering year on year growth in shareholder returns mr mcinnes said
3941233 i served with sen mccain and he and i were the only two to vote against the bush cheney tax cuts
3941234 during this campaign it is a different john mccain he is saying he would make the tax cuts permanent he is advocating more drilling whereas he voted against drilling in anwr it goes to his credibility and that is such an important issue for this country plus his foreign policy has been consistently with bush cheney and i know from my perspective that is a huge issue for the united states
3941235 his foreign policy has been consistently with bush cheney and i know from my perspective that is a huge issue for the united states
3941236 i think the little flare up we are witnessing in georgia is another illustration of the different approach these two men are taking
3941237 in my judgment theres a difference between realism and pseudo realism
3941238 the pseudo realists believe that we can operate in the world alone that expanding international law doesnt matter that things like arms control are false starts
3941239 you try to work with allies rather than without them
3941240 and that is the kind of realism that i think is common sense to the vast majority of the american people and thats what senator obama is reflecting in so many of his speeches
3941241 the portfolio of issues passed on to the next president is as daunting as any since wwii the case for inspiring new political leadership and the social ethic has seldom been more evident barack obamas platform is a call for change but the change that he is articulating is more renewal than departure it is rooted in very old american values that are very much part of the republican as well as the democratic tradition the national interest requires a new approach to our interaction with the world including the recognition that a long term occupation of iraq is likely dangerously destabilizing
3941242 its basically one under a vc its very significant and its long overdue
3941243 they went up the chain of command in vietnam but by the time they came out the other end they changed
3941244 what normally happens at the end of a conflict they have a thing called the end of war list an end of war review and you go back through what alterations were made to recommendations over the time of that conflict
3941245 these particular issues werent considered as part of that end of war review
3941246 i guess the important point and what we should focus on today is very much the fact that the gallantry of these men but also of d company as a whole and all those involved is being duly recognised finally

3941300 we have the leverage now that the company had in 2002 and in 2005

3941302 my ballclub battled back came back from behind got some clutch base hits and were in position to close it out in the ninth and gave up a tough hit
3941303 the manager said to me to be ready to go out as a pinch hitter
3941304 going to bat in that last inning weve got a good lineup from top to bottom
3941305 ive seen us hit for a week and a half two weeks and there was no doubt we were going to go out there and put some solid at bats together and put a push toward coming back and we did its just a sign of how good of a team we are its just too bad we had a couple miscues at the end but i feel like we played a pretty strong game
3941306 hell have a better chance to help us on the offensive line
3941307 its a win win for him and the team if he picks it up well enough to get into the playing rotation
3941308 theyre very talented they just have to get comfortable with their assignments and let their ability take over
3941309 its not a surprise really but its good to see him doing what we expected he would do
3941310 is close to the form he showed two years ago
3941311 hes a versatile athlete with his size 6 4 240 and agility he can split out wide and scare the dickens out of a cornerback and he can come inside and block hes not completely back to where he was before but hes closing in
3941312 the quarterbacks some things they do well one day and not so well the next weve got to get that smoothed out
3941313 that first one a lot of players come out too excited too wired up and dont execute like they can we didnt do a good job overall with good technique i expect that will be much better on saturday

3941328 can you name a right afforded to us by the constitution that has since been revoked
3941329 there are none so blind as those who will not see the most deluded people are those who choose to ignore what they already know

3941342 in todays forum citizens of the fifth district got a clear contrast of the two choices ahead of them in november more of congressman goodes same failed policies that have led to job loss higher gas prices and a less secure world or tom perriellos positive agenda and energetic vision for the future we certainly won over the room and we believe we can win over the fifth district
3941343 the issue of energy security is our number one national security threat our number one environmental threat and our number one economic opportunity we need a complete generational commitment to energy independence and we must be committed to making the 5th district this nations leader in alternative energy
3941344 goode has never voted for an energy plan that wouldnt make the gas companies more money he has 200 000 personally invested in oil and gas companies he has taken over 100 000 in contributions from big energy and big oil and every single one of his votes makes them more money
3941345 this is another area where i have not sat on the sidelines ive been working since 2006 to ask the right questions we need people who understand how to fix this war every single person in washington has failed on this issue i will stand up to any democrat or republican who continues to fail to push toward peace in iraq
3941346 i dont agree with the premise that the united states has a bad health care system i also contest 45 million uninsured people there are about 12 to 15 million persons in the country illegally and most of them dont have health insurance and we can reduce that figure significantly if they werent in the united states
3941347 anyone who thinks the healthcare system in america is working is probably on the kind of healthcare that members of congress get instead of the healthcare that the rest of us get
3941348 it is amazing how a creature so fragile can achieve such immeasurable superiority

3941350 he has a stinger which when you play that position its your middle name
3941351 its going to be a part of the job description unfortunately because he does a lot of blocking he has a stinger that were keeping an eye on to make sure everything is ok his head was ok we were concerned that he had a mild concussion but that wasnt the case
3941352 its a great example of why you have to practice he dropped two balls in critical situations and couldnt finish the long run a lot of that has to do with that he hasnt been out here

3941359 m y objection to what obama says is obama says well you know in college he it were he quit drugs my whole point of the book is self reporting from people they admit they use drugs is not reliable as to when they quit
3941360 this book is full of innuendos misstatements lies he says mr corsi says its 300 pages 600 footnotes and i stand by every statement in this book let me see if you stand by some of these statements doctor obama never revealed if or when he stopped using drugs thats a lie the truth is that he said in his own book dreams from my father that he stopped when he got into college
3941361 he fully admitted his drug use both marijuana and cocaine he says it continued through college
3941362 im still not convinced that he actually was born a natural born citizen
3941363 if oil demand continues to slow then opec should adjust its output accordingly
3941364 you cant increase supply when demand is falling the key figure is demand
3941365 when the trend is downwards investors stay away from high cost projects
3941366 the price is still high but has fallen 30 in a very short time
3941367 but sanctions stop development of oil production so it means consumers pay more if we develop our oil industry for whom are we doing it for consumers of course they insist on more supply so they should remove obstacles to it
3941368 were both fine and shias fine as well his hand is healing well

3941374 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3941375 we expect russia to honour its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance
3941376 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbours occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3941377 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions

3941388 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
3941389 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
3941390 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3941401 this is a terrible time to be trying to sell a newspaper
3941402 the sales value of newspapers has probably dropped in half in the last five years there are a lot of newspapers that are up for sale and there are no takers or no one willing to pay what the sellers want

3941407 these statements constitute clear interference in the internal affairs of an integral part of india
3941408 the government of pakistan condemns the excessive and unwarranted use of force against the people of indian occupied kashmir
3941409 such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
3941410 economic blockade imposed by hindu extremists against the muslims of jammu and the valley of kashmir
3941411 i am going to have to keep this under lock and key to avoid kidnapping
3941412 the omni fort worth has now changed our skyline forever

3941415 we cant comment on where the investigation might be leading us
3941416 he is still interested in this project hes been interested for more than a year now we are also as a backup got three other hotel developers that would build a somewhat different product without a conference center but still a very nice hotel that would locate next to bass
3941417 we could probably go 30 60 or 90 days before we have to make a commitment on the type of hotel but we would go ahead and restructure the incentives package with the city
3941418 in no way shape or form hinges on mr hammons hotel group being involved in the project and of course bass pro shops certainly does not hinge on his involvement
3941419 im very confident there will be a hotel at sweetwater next to bass pro shops it may not have a conference center initially but i do believe there will be a first class hotel there
3941420 there are two kinds of music good music and bad music i like good music

3941426 the police initially deployed water canon then mild lathi charge and teargas shells at last they had to resort to firing in the air to disperse the uncontrollable mob
3941427 the deep rooted politicisation of indias battle with terror can be understood by how the bharatiya janata party bjp the major right wing party has used political and religious tensions in jammu and kashmir during electoral battles over the past 20 years the manner in which the issue of illegal immigrants read bangladeshis muslims has been whipped up by them to polarise sentiments and win elections and now how the issue of recent terror attacks is likely to be used in future
3941428 it is these draconian laws that are causing terrorism in the country
3941429 if police officers kill innocent people in fake encounters and if this and other misuse happens on a large scale then the inevitable consequence of that is to turn ordinary people into terrorists
3941430 i dont think any law will have the slightest effect on curbing terrorism maja daruwala director of the commonwealth human rights initiative in india told ips
3941431 if the average policing is anything to go by the police depend mostly on tip offs they appear to have no other means at their disposal says daruwala
3941432 de politicised held to a professional standard and given internal management systems that are run on competent technology and skills not on patronage
3941433 the deeprooted politicisation of indias intelligence agencies in all blasts investigations has succeeded in investigations not leading to the guilty

3941455 more people are now demanding finishing options that save time current scoring perforating and cutting tools on the market simply do not produce the quality finishing results that companies require our device not only matches the results expected from the proven flatbed methods but it also performs faster users can also run two applications together in close proximity such as micro perforation and creasing or cutting and creasing everything is available in one box and is simple to use and operator friendly
3941456 set up takes only minutes with the menu driven touch screen interface which also ensures operator friendly easy editing of programmed jobs up to 20 jobs can be stored into memory an added advantage is the ability to carry out inverted and regular impact creasing of up to 10 scores per sheet in the same pass

3941470 there is a perception at present that banks are not offering mortgages in fact our latest study suggests that access to finance is not a major issue
3941471 instead many buyers are taking a wait and see attitude naturally some feel uncomfortable buying a home which may be worth less in six months time
3941472 almost one in four buyers think they might struggle to get a mortgage however just one in fifty has actually given up on their purchase due to failing to find a suitable loan
3941473 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart

3941484 the worst case scenario is that russia decides not to adhere to the peace plan which is still in very outlined form russia may even go as far as to surround or shell tbilisi itself

3941488 the key debate for those who teach a level students and undergraduates is whether the pressure on teachers and lecturers to spoon feed a level students through exams means students fail to develop the desire to continue learning and the skills to learn independently

3941561 ste es un club que promete que tiene un objetivo ambicioso
3941562 seg n me coment su presidente la meta ser luchar por los puestos altos de la tabla e incluso si es posible optar por el ascenso de categor a
3941563 el club cuenta con nuestro apoyo incondicional y estaremos al lado de la instituci n en su d a a d a

3941565 soy el primero que viene con una tremenda ilusi n de hacer un buen a o y de aportar cosas al equipo
3941566 hay que ir con mucha calma y tratar de hacer las cosas bien
3941567 los ciclos se acaban lleg un entrenador que no iba a contar mucho conmigo y le estoy agradecido al tenerife de darme esta oportunidad
3941568 todo lo que me lleg de este club son referencias positivas
3941569 un equipo serio donde se puede disfrutar del f tbol y un proyecto ilusionante
3941570 queremos igualdad que se busque financiaci n y si no se puede o no se quiere que se diga y que sea agache en una asamblea la que decida su futuro y diga en qu ayuntamiento quiere estar si ste no cambia de actitud con nuestros pueblo
3941571 porque es imposible seguir aguantando el c mulo de desprop sitos del ayuntamiento en esta y anteriores legislaturas
3941572 no figure en ning n plan de actuaci n del ayuntamiento
3941573 somos una comarca con problemas de electricidad ahora sin agua sin alcantarillado sin servicios m nimos con las entradas al pueblo llenas de peligros para cualquier persona carentes de cualquier infraestructura que permita al ciudadano de agache estar en las mismas condiciones de igualdad que el resto de los g imareros
3941574 especialmente porque el bosque de pinos canarios se ha regenerado parcialmente en tan s lo un a o
3941575 precisamente una de las especies que sobrevivi al incendio ha sido el pino m s alto de gran canaria con 47 metros de altura y m s de 300 a os
3941576 han pasado tantos a os que quiero que todo el mundo recuerde y disfrute los xitos que han hecho populares ellos mismos
3941577 est n cualquiera de los dos castros all va a ser dif cil que los cubanos sean libres
3941578 si ellos ven que con fidel fuera del poder tampoco hubiera habido ning n cambio creo que hubiera sido un problema muy grande
3941579 hay muchos cortes a nivel nacional para la educaci n y particularmente en florida y tengo que decir que mi madre era maestra muchas veces la vi sacar dinero de su bolsillo para mejorar la vida de sus estudiantes porque la educaci n es muy importante
3941580 tengo el privilegio de cantar y de hacer algo que amo en la vida y he recibido mucho de la gente por eso para m es muy importante poder devolver algo cada vez que tengo la oportunidad
3941581 el esfuerzo econ mico realizado es debido fundamentalmente al fuerte crecimiento poblacional experimentado en algunas islas del archipi lago
3941582 lograr una educaci n de calidad que por una parte permita formar a los ni os ni as y j venes que constituir n el canarias del ma ana
3941583 ya empezamos el a o pasado a colaborar con el tenerife en este campa a
3941584 pienso que es una iniciativa que merece la pena y no s lo por lo que supone el respaldo al tenerife que busca esa ansiado ascenso a primera que ojal pueda ser esta campa a
3941585 tambi n es una manera de potenciar el comercio de nuestro municipio
3941586 la venta de abonos va muy bien porque ya estamos pr ximos a los 4 500
3941587 el municipio de candelaria es pionero en este tipo de iniciativas de nuestro club a la hora de acercarnos a los ayuntamientos
3941588 y es un apoyo fundamental espero que cunda el ejemplo en el resto de municipios de la isla
3941589 esperamos continuar en esa l nea y lograr involucrar en este iniciativa alrededor de 20 ayuntamientos
3941590 animo a los aficionados a que se sumen a retirar sus abonos porque el ahorro es considerable
3941591 adem s se podr n ver de forma gratuita los amistosos contra el universidad la presentaci n frente al roda y el partido correspondiente a la copa del rey
3941592 agradecer la ayuda que presta cajacanarias al proporcionar el medio de transporte con la ventaja que eso supone a la hora del desplazamiento e incluso por la comodidad de no tener que buscar aparcamiento
3941593 los rivales tambi n se han reforzado pero nuestra idea es luchar desde el principio por los primeros puestos
3941594 al tercer o cuarto partido de la temporada se ver nuestro verdadero potencial
3941595 no podemos hacer nada muchos tenemos que coger la guagua igual
3941596 se den cuenta de que no pueden hacer lo que quieran aunque nos tengan cogidos por las mu ecas
3941597 el bono no me va a dar para mucho si sigo yendo al sur no me dura ni dos viajes
3941598 haber subido s lo el tranv a para que los ciudadanos opt ramos m s por la guagua porque yo no entiendo estas medidas y que no me digan que es por el carburante que no me lo creo es demasiada subida
3941599 tengo que ir igual y de un tiempo a esta parte todo sube lo veo normal
3941600 y luego no lo facilitan y nosotros no tenemos coche
3941601 si seguimos as ya uno no podr permitirse ni ir en la guagua
3941602 no es de recibo despu s de todo lo expuesto pedir responsabilidad a los sindicatos que llevan ocho meses siendo toreados por la direcci n de la empresa y por la administraci n que representa manuel ortega
3941603 de una vez por todas sea claro y respetuoso tanto con los usuarios como con la plantilla de titsa
3941604 la guagua es un servicio p blico no la joya de la corona como el tranv a en el cual se han volcado dejando de lado a los dem s transportes
3941605 nos parece injusto que tengamos que pagar 0 10 euros m s por billete ya que para nosotros los estudiantes el transporte p blico es algo imprescindible al no disponer de veh culo propio
3941606 con un brutal error de c lculo que ha generado problemas en cadena
3941607 distrayendo fondos de forma intencionada para engordar otros gastos superfluos
3941608 mientras se aumentaba en un abusivo 35 por ciento 75 millones de euros el gasto de actividades protocolarias del gobierno aut nomo
3941609 generado la gesti n econ mica del actual gobierno canario
3941610 la menor asignaci n econ mica a los cabildos y a las administraciones p blicas
3941611 en vez de reconocer los errores acuse a las instituciones de derrochar
3941612 paralizado el aumento de las asignaciones ahora auguran que se les recortar n
3941613 sin perjudicar las partidas a los cabildos y al resto de administraciones locales
3941614 vuelve a enga ar porque est por debajo del crecimiento general del presupuesto de gasto interanual
3941615 la recaudaci n canaria tiene muchas lagunas que hay que arreglar ahora con austeridad
3941616 falta de compromiso con la renovaci n de la planta tur stica obsoleta ya que todav a no han firmado el compromiso con el consorcio
3941617 ausencia de credibilidad en la gesti n y los errores presupuestarios que justifican echando la culpa a otros
3941618 este gobierno de coalici n desfondado tiene un desastroso balance de gesti n y tiene que timonearse
3941619 si soria quiere obtener 300 millones de euros por el extinto impuesto tr fico de empresas ite tiene que dialogar de forma seria con los socialistas y replantear los t rminos de la solicitud porque tal y como lo argumenta actualmente el estado no le conceder esa partida
3941620 lo cierto es que pedro solbes ministro de econom a confirma que el consejero no dice ni una sola palabra de ese tema ni se atreve porque sabe que no tienen ninguna raz n y que con ese planteamiento no va a ninguna parte
3941621 cree que hay un caso filesa en canarias que vaya a los tribunales
3941622 el desastre que el psoe ha montado con la econom a el estatuto de autonom a catal n la financiaci n catalana y las consecuencias de todo ello para la financiaci n
3941623 the absence of a commitment to excellence is the acceptance of mediocrity
3941624 motha fucker im packing your shit and i want you out
3941625 it was not only the army that rose in its defense but also regular citizens
3941626 the planes came in and they started to bomb the ground was covered with dead people and there was nowhere to go
3941627 the people that died they died from their houses falling in on them from the shrapnel and from concussions
3941628 well get an electrical box and a blank plate and make it look like former wiring
3941629 how to get customers for your landscaping and lawn care business all year long
3941630 to explain these priviledges under existing international rules we in effect authorize any person or group holding effective power in a country regardless of how they acquired or exercise it to sell the countrys resources and to dispose of the proceeds of such sales to borrow in the countrys name and thereby to impose debt service obligations upon it to sign treaties on the countrys behalf and thus to bind its present and future population and to use state revenues to buy the means of internal repression
3941631 they are making poisonous chemicals for foreigners that the foreigners dont dare produce in their own countries
3941632 it is better to die now forcing them out than to die of a slow suicide
3941633 the most remarkable dust storm image that i have ever seen
3941634 if corporations existed to make products then they would make the best product possible and places like mcdonalds would not exist
3941635 yes there would be trade offs for more production and prosperity yes it would poison the water and air
3941636 but thats the problem there are many other products that because they dont kill enough people are never reported on i mean thats the science of recall if a default in a product isnt pronounced enough for it to become less profitable then they dont bother recalling the product
3941637 you can get a pig after you get your own place
3941638 how you can get over your fear of dogs is get a boyfriend
3941639 is it because i can then get used to being jumped on and licked
3941640 tecora just because you forgive a person doesnt mean you have to be friends with them

3941651 dejen de ser unas fechas para que la gente se emborrache a las dos o tres de la ma ana
3941652 que la fiesta siga hasta la hora que la gente quiera
3941653 s lo hubo una denuncia que se pudo solucionar en el acto
3941654 la importancia y la historia intelectual que tiene el carnaval
3941655 una propuesta que a n no ha llegado a buen puerto
3941656 ya que no es s lo una semana de fiestas sino unos d as en los que se involucra todo el pueblo de tenerife
3941657 en la figura m s representativa del terror una figura que no es otra que frankenstein y vestirlo como va la gente de la calle en estos d as
3941658 espero que salga a la luz que ese cartel ganador es un plagio yo lo he visto casi calcado en un salon del comic
3941659 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
3941660 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
3941661 during the past year many of the top social networking sites have demonstrated rapid growth in their global user bases
3941662 facebooks recent ascension to become the top global social networking site has been spurred by its substantial growth across worldwide regions

3941664 it doesnt matter how many times you read it it still wont make you feel any better
3941665 if you think our girls are little because of looks then maybe you should think the europeans and americans are strong because of doping
3941666 if it was up to the athletes the k rolyis would have been banned from the sport a long time ago

3941677 desde antes de que nos lo propusieran guadalupe y yo ten amos la intenci n de hacer una especie de biograf a de lara pero empezamos a trabajar en 2002 tres a os m s tarde luego de discutir acerca de problemas de estilo nos sentamos frente a la computadora para redactar juntos el resultado de una investigaci n de cerca de siete a os
3941678 fue la primera que crey en l de las 400 y tantas canciones de su repertorio m s de la mitad son dedicadas a ella
3941679 agust n lara se construy un personaje muy interesante y para eso su paso por el cine le vino de maravilla hizo que pr cticamente todas las mujeres de m xico se enamoraran de l las palabras que ten a para enunciar el amor se volvieron las mismas de un pa s entero para expresar ese sentimiento era inseguro y extremo al mismo tiempo generoso y mezquino lo que verdaderamente le importaba era estar enamorado era un hombre que sabi ndose feo era vanidoso

3941692 after almost two weeks of suffering with unbearable back pain and unable to get any sleep he was so weak and looked horrible
3941693 he said i told the nursing department im in pain but they dont believe me

3941696 when you take 23 jobs out of the community ultimately itll be 26 jobs thats a lot for a small town to sustain
3941697 they know theyre paying a premium but theyre delighted to do it

3941700 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
3941701 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
3941702 the biggest issue on the mind is the high fuel prices and ive encountered most persons that are in favor of a pro drill policy in anwar
3941703 jobs and economic relief to working families and small business and i think everyone in washington has taken their eye off the ball
3941704 the national party for the first time ever has made this a priority swing race the fact is hes gotten out of touch with the district its not that hes a bad guy its just that hes gotten a little out of touch with the amount of money and time he spends up in washington
3941705 im in touch with the district i focus my time on being in the 5th district and washington ive done that over the years and i think thats crucial to go around a district find out whats on peoples mind
3941706 most profound ideological shift in the five decade long history of the cuban revolution redefin ing socialism and effectively declar ing the end of that system
3941707 socialism means social justice and equality but equality of rights of opportunities not of income
3941708 t his remarkable declaration represents an embrace of a postmodern version of socialism
3941709 signal s a dramatic ideological shift that actually heralds the end of socialism
3941710 castros indication that his government will eliminate some free services and excessive subsidies to consumer goods is further evidence that cuba is about to enter a postsocialist era
3941711 old tree master of beauty teacher of elegancy holder of the key to our divinity might you spare me some of your time for i am lost in this vivid reality
3941712 this is but a dream this is but the unreal gravity oh gravity suck me back to reality gravity oh gravity suck me back to veracity
3941713 do you feel pain lost one do you feel alive this is not a dream this is but the beginning of your thrive
3941714 this is not a dream this is not a dream
3941715 there time has been spared for you young one what do you seek
3941716 where am i and what are you if this is not a dream then please explain what i have felt and seen
3941717 what did you you only removed another piece from this puzzle of mine
3941718 you are now in an intersected universal world where only you and i human and plant could communicate
3941719 yes what happened to me and you in my world and mind me asking of your story this is the first time i have encountered a tree that has its roots scattered in the sky
3941720 even i dont know of my own body back in your and my world but what i do know is that when i return i feel that time was spent and also strangely rewinded as in times complex system reaches failure and it starts to put together different events that happened in the past and will happen in the future together in a new time sorry abraham for i do not know exactly about your body in your or my world
3941721 and yet oddly amusing so tell me about yourself now wise legna
3941722 i am a single tree from heaven i chose to watch and observe why god favoured humans from other creatures i have been here for thousands of years from the time of the first human appearance on earth and untill now i have grown old abraham and i have waited too long for one single human being to contact me and at last you showed up
3941723 god does not exist how could god exist while he is the creator of existence itself god is beyond his creatures words
3941724 believe me abraham your mind could not even handle this kind of knowledge for even i a heavens descendant cant handle it
3941725 conservative commentator a rare republican takes fight to former colleagues
3941726 he didnt want to compromise to come to an agreement he never called anyone to discuss an issue or talk it over he was more interested in making a statement
3941727 he had his own agenda and often abstained from voting that was his vote
3941728 sealed proposals will be received by the city until 2 00 p m august 15 2008 from qualified firms to provide a solution to the rat infestation problem on the downtown mall
3941729 thats something hes gone away to look at but i was encouraged by the fact that hed acknowledged that yes there is a very significant gap
3941730 i would expect like the reserve bank that any reduction of interest rates by the bank would be passed on by the banks but i can understand their ceos are being cautious about giving rolled gold guarantees about these things because theyve got other factors that theyve got to worry about as well
3941731 my feeling is that the worst is behind us there
3941732 i mean the write offs that banks are making in america and europe have actually lessened in recent times
3941733 the green policy seems to have changed entirely on the matter not that long ago the then deputy john gormley was staunchly opposing an incinerator in his own constituency
3941734 the department does not give any sort of blessing to any specific development because the department and the minister is absolutely precluded from involvement in the planning process
3941735 people cant help wondering and possibly there would be an element of people putting two and two together but the indications were given by representatives of his party that mr gormley is not in favour of the incinerator
3941736 we dont feel that incineration is the best method of disposing of waste
3941737 i think theres been some surveys about the safety of this building that i recall and steps were taken to secure the building
3941738 would be prejudicial to human and http www irishtimes com newspaper breaking 2008 0711 breaking54 htm
3941739 if we have to have dirty industry in this country then a better place needs to be found for it well away from human habitation and acutely environmentally sensitive activities
3941740 we know that soot pm2 5 particle pollution can cause significant harm especially to children and senior citizens at levels well below this standard
3941741 by choosing politics over science epa is jeopardizing the health of our communities
3941742 its disappointing that the epa usa has once again put industry before public health
3941743 this decision goes against the combined recommendations of over 2 000 peer reviewed studies medical and health groups and the epas own independent science advisers it was clearly based on political science not medical science
3941744 this week and ive been scouring the web for dishes that look promising a week of food

3941751 no se puede negar que hoy d a algunos ni os est n m s violentos que antes al tiempo que agreg que para combatir esto se requiere del compromiso de toda la sociedad no s lo del gobierno que est haciendo su trabajo no s lo los profesores directores sino principalmente el compromiso de la familia

3941765 this is the time of the olympics and were talking about air quality in china
3941766 its all well and good to criticize other countries but lets get our own house in order
3941767 approximately 70 per cent of acute premature deaths will come from these two provinces possibly reflecting their poorer air quality relative to other parts of canada
3941768 western canada with approximately 30 per cent of the population of canada accounts for one quarter of the acute premature deaths
3941769 air pollution can be dangerous at levels that are within the accepted air quality standards
3941770 one of the effects we hope this lawsuit will have is that it will cause all levels of government to now look carefully at having propane establishments in residential areas
3941771 the house basically imploded on itself all the ceilings are on the floor
3941772 the one thing about canadians is we love our sports be it hockey or football
3941773 despite me being in the nfl i was also a fan of the cfl so i understand that theyre loyal to their teams its ok if theyre going to be out there in protest but its all for a love of the game if you guys love football then support it
3941774 i know what its like because when i was coming up the browns left cleveland
3941775 we just have to play where its deemed for us to play but i certainly know the feeling
3941776 somebodys got to be north americas team right it might as well be us
3941777 im looking forward to getting toronto people to believe in the bills and make it like a home away from home
3941778 i think people understand we have always tried to regionalize our product
3941779 they see what weve done in rochester where the bills hold their training camp over the past decade
3941780 were looking to do everything we can to keep the franchise viable and having a market like toronto that is so vibrant wed be remiss if we didnt reach out into it
3941781 we will stay on a schedule in terms of this game in terms of people we want to play and when we want to see them
3941782 but wed like to win it with whos on the field and were not going to change our approach to the football game
3941783 they are very aware of whats going on within our organization and what were trying to do in order to keep our franchise healthy and viable
3941784 we know we have a loyal fan base here and back in western new york
3941785 wed like to expand our fan base here and were excited about the opportunity
3941786 its a tremendous place so much culture with a lot to do
3941787 pre season games have been played in canada before but to a regular nfl season game were excited to be part of that a new introduction of nfl football to the canadian market
3941788 transferring sultan kohails case to an adult court is very troubling given the possibility of him receiving the death penalty
3941789 we are working very hard with our lawyer but i dont know what will happen
3941790 usually after a sentence is done its done period but the implication in sultans case is that there is some pressure applied and it seems to come from the murdered mans family
3941791 this is what they are aiming for otherwise why change things
3941792 turkey has a similar situation where two men were convicted of blasphemy but the president and the prime minister called the king and it was done with

3941800 as a male its difficult to enforce to say your kilt is too short because then why am i looking there
3941801 are style conscious and want underwear that doesnt produce a visible panty line
3941802 for adult women that notion of being kind of girlie and innocent and sexually pure as well as very sexy has been in mens magazines forever
3941803 total girl to marketers means finding every inch of their body to adorn
3941804 expanding ones market means not just reaching down to the lower ages for products introduced to the older ages but finding new parts of their bodies to colonize or own the tiniest parts the forgotten parts such as nails which should be dirty after a day of play
3941805 girls of 6 wore low cut dresses and very fetching hairdos
3941806 you can see it in the paintings all meant to be sent off to louis xv or some such they dont have any breasts yet but never mind
3941807 you have an idea that children are a separate marvellous terribly fragile impressionable innocent kind of creature that needs freedom and liberty of all kinds there was the sense of nature infusing everything they get to play and have a wonderful time and move all of their parts
3941808 it was very very important that the girls wore short dresses and the ladies wore long dresses
3941809 girls wore their hair down in curls or braids and put their hair up at the time they got long dresses whenever they were supposed to be marriageable the idea was that children are innocent they dont have any sexuality so dont worry
3941810 were dressing little kids like adults and adults are dressing like little children there is no distinction once again a girl is a woman by the time shes 8 and a woman remains a girl until shes 80
3941811 they are in the middle of numerous commercially created battles with their children
3941812 battles about junk food violent media expensive brands and all sorts of things its hard if not impossible to say no all of the time
3941813 a tawdry tarty cartoonlike version of female sexuality has become so ubiquitous it no longer seems particular
3941814 what we once regarded as a kind of sexual expression we now view as sexuality
3941815 so pervasive and so mainstream that it has just about lost its ability to shock
3941816 this is some sort of response to the feminist movement
3941817 it meant throwing out the skirts and certainly girdles and dressing so that you couldnt tell the difference between a man and a woman except very small things
3941818 the masculine wardrobe was entirely co opted by women suits and shoulder pads denied curves breasts and behinds and hips were not in fashion
3941819 just because we are post doesnt mean we are feminists
3941820 there is a widespread assumption that simply because my generation of women has the good fortune to live in a world touched by the feminist movement that means everything we do is magically imbued with its agenda
3941821 the problem is that girls are acquiring the trappings of maturity
3941822 but theres no indication that their social or emotional development is keeping pace
3941823 will she be popular will she be invited somewhere with what group does she belong
3941824 before a girl has half a chance to reflect on issues of belonging and desirability she is being confronted with a market that tells her she should be concerned about this even when shes as young as 8
3941825 youd think shed be wearing the t she got at the summer camp she went to the music festival she attended or the humane society where she volunteers to walk the dogs but instead they express attitude rather than interests skills concerns and hobbies
3941826 says that its preferable to pose on the beach rather than surf to shop rather than play to decorate rather than invent
3941827 they are setting out to make a profit selling clothes to and for children and dont care what the consequences are
3941828 what they do comprehend is that they get a lot of attention by dressing in a particular way
3941829 now its really not about fantasy play its about adopting something thats out there for them its like practice for something very specific to be like jessica simpson
3941830 ratcheted up male fantasy of what women should look like big eyes big lips big breasts an anorexic waistline and very long legs
3941831 that kind of plastic sexuality seems to be normalized for younger and younger kids
3941832 twenty years ago we were talking about girls and loss of voice and self esteem and there were all these empowerment programs
3941833 now we have girls and women more likely to go to college getting better grades being really out there and claiming more power what women are doing is challenging the status quo and when that happens things tighten up its an anxiety a collective response
3941834 you can learn a whole lot of very serious narcissism by being brought up to be looked at constantly

3941896 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3941897 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3941898 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3941899 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3941900 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3941901 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3941902 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3941903 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3941904 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3941905 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3941906 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3941911 the key to those guys was being on the field
3941912 getting the speed of the game understanding exactly what we want to get done
3941913 the world has enough women who are tough we need women who are tender there are enough women who are coarse we need women who are kind there are enough women who are rude we need women who are refined we have enough women of fame and fortune we need more women of faith we have enough greed we need more goodness we have enough vanity we need more virtue we have enough popularity we need more purity

3941915 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3941920 one of the greatest misconceptions of our still relatively young digital age that windows based computers are pcs while macs are well something else
3941921 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3941922 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3941923 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3941924 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3941925 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3941926 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3941927 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3941928 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3941929 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3941930 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3941931 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3941932 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3941933 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3941934 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3941935 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3941936 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3941937 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3941938 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3941939 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3941940 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3941941 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3941942 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3941943 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3941944 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3941945 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3941946 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3941947 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3941948 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

3941952 i think its the competitiveness and the spirit those athletes have and the sportsmanship they show
3941953 on september 2 1944 bush and three other avenger pilots escorted by hellcat fighter planes were directed to attack a radio transmitter on chichi jima
3941954 learned that neither jack delaney nor ted white had survived one went down with the plane the other was seen jumping but his parachute failed to open
3941955 the plane was lifted forward and we were enveloped in flames
3941956 i saw the flames running along the wings where the fuel tanks were and where the wings fold i thought this is really bad its hard to remember the details but i looked at the instruments and couldnt see them for the smoke
3941957 you could have seen that smoke for a hundred miles
3941958 i pulled up to him then he lost power and i went sailing by him

3941990 ethnic conflicts in this part of the caucuses have lasted for centuries it is a very controversial and fragile issue everybody should handle it carefully
3941991 the most important goal for all of us here is to establish peace and stop the disaster
3941992 these are russian tanks outside of gori shooting at our military bases
3941993 we are absolutely outraged by this cowardly attack against humanitarian workers people who were in a marked humanitarian vehicle
3941994 they were unarmed obviously there was not a military convoy in sight and it is utterly reprehensible that they should be killed in this brutal inexplicable fashion
3941995 she was an expert in her field phd an internationally recognized authority on education education for women and girls especially in conflict settings
3941996 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3941997 they called and i didnt really quite believe it i was hoping i was still asleep and it was a dream but it was for real
3941998 shes made a huge difference in the world already but i think its just a tragedy a stupid waste that she should be brought to a halt so violently and so soon she had so much that she was offering people
3941999 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3942000 they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in the humanitarian community in afghanistan
3942001 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the dangers that everybody there faces not just military people but all those who are there trying to help rebuild this country
3942002 canada is recognized the world over for its compassion and generosity
3942003 both humanitarian aid workers shared these values and their convictions motivated them to contribute to afghanistans reconstruction efforts and to help maintain the hope for a better future that is so needed in a country that has been torn apart by years of hostility
3942004 she was utterly compassionate she was giving she was courageous and she was very very good at her work
3942005 she really was as good as it gets as a humanitarian worker and as an individual and we are heart broken and utterly grief stricken by her loss
3942006 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most

3942091 what i was hoping for with him and what i got is that he didnt use anything as an excuse
3942092 he put it all upon himself he didnt use the way the coach used him or injuries or being young when he came in the league none of that
3942093 he took responsibility for himself and really once he did that for me it was easy thats one of the biggest things to get athletes to hold themselves accountable whether he did that when he was 18 or 19 im pretty sure i was mature at 18 or 19 but i wouldnt have been ready to be thrown into a no 1 pick or right into the nba and handle that kind of responsibility whether he acknowledged responsibility at that time didnt really matter to me the fact that now he does is the only thing i want to judge him on

3942103 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3942104 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
3942105 i would expect like the reserve bank that any reduction of interest rates by the bank would be passed on by the banks but i can understand their ceos are being cautious about giving rolled gold guarantees about these things because theyve got other factors that theyve got to worry about as well

3942150 without question americas fire situation has changed its not going to go back
3942151 we cant afford not to fight fires homes and lives are at stake
3942152 these fires are only going to become more frequent and more intense
3942153 right now its looking to be under pretty good control
3942154 we wouldnt consider it 100 per cent contained but we have a pretty good grasp of the fire
3942155 theyve got a helicopter flying over top dropping water on it
3942156 but if it does get out of control theres some houses down less than an eighth of a mile lower than the hill that could be threatened by the fire
3942157 apparently the camp they are on is so large that it has its own fire department

3942163 we were taking a lot of pictures and we sent some pictures with them its just a warm fuzzy kind of feeling you know
3942164 this is not their job their job is still their other assignment they do this just in their spare time
3942165 the way i feel its just showing how the volunteer firefighters get together to help each other out
3942166 we didnt send any firefighters into the building it was pretty clear early on there was not only fire throughout the building but there was also some structural instability
3942167 most guys i talk to say theyve been to a couple of shows at comedy clubs and they thought it was a bit hacky and didnt really like it this is who im trying to convert

3942173 were hoping to recover some of the subsidy to the townships

3942199 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3942200 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3942201 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3942202 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3942203 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3942204 oh shame you got stuck your rides broken your gonna die ill pray for you
3942205 i like it i like it i la la la like it la la la like

3942209 ive been waiting my whole life just so i can come on here and do this gosh how grateful i am i sure am happy that some lovely person or people made this so that i can do this because i dont know what i would do with myself otherwise
3942210 oh how thankful we should all be that these habits to participate in are here for us like counting to seven backwards inside your head while screaming turquoise
3942211 and she knew this so in order to win he knew that she must attain the most extensive arsenal of woven plant matter firearms and face masks
3942212 candidate who signed petition to get anti gay marriage referendum on the ballot says he doesnt support it
3942213 i did sign the petition to get it on the ballot so it can be voted down
3942214 i didnt sign a petition supporting the amendment at all i signed a petition to put it on the ballot
3942215 qui dorme in pace il nobile marchese signore di rovigo e di belluno ardimentoso eroe di mille imprese morto l11 maggio del31

3942219 lurido porco come ti permetti paragonarti a me chebbi natali illustri nobilissimi e perfetti da fare invidia a principi reali
3942220 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment
3942221 do not lay hands upon anyone too hastily and thereby share responsibility for the sins of others
3942222 wrath to come matt 3 7 he witnessed the kingdom of god matt 3 2 john had the insight into the secrets of mens hearts matt 3 7 understand this about prophets they are aware of things that are hidden from other men
3942223 wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked rev 3 17
3942224 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3942225 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
3942226 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
3942227 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
3942228 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
3942229 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
3942230 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
3942231 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
3942232 how do you know you really want to marry this guy
3942233 two weeks isnt long enough to get to know someone
3942234 its impossible not to conclude that the words and pictures these journalists produced were considered unhelpful to the war effort and that their arrests would have served a broader strategy of information control
3942235 when you carefully consider foia requests and decide to withhold records in whole or in part you can be assured that the department of justice will defend your decisions unless they lack a sound legal basis or present an unwarranted risk of adverse impact on the ability of other agencies to protect other important records
3942236 when a matter of public policy poses a straight up choice between the publics rights of access to government and a government effort to infringe or even narrow those rights journalists cannot pretend to be disinterested observers
3942237 this is the moment to make it clear to all the presidential candidates how important reversal of the ashcroft directive is to us and to the people
3942238 we need to ask the candidates at every opportunity whether they are willing to appoint an attorney general willing to follow the spirit as well as the letter of the law that protects the peoples right to know what their government is doing
3942239 some people might believe that the federal government should both tax and spend at about 18 percent of gross domestic product gdp while others might believe it should tax and spend at about 30 percent of gdp no reasonable person however would argue that the government should tax at 18 percent and spend at 30 percent yet this is the future we will get if we try to fund the spending required by current law with todays level of taxation
3942240 beginning of the one world government is near where everyone is nothing but a slave existing only as a file within a supercomputer system
3942241 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3942242 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance
3942243 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3942244 its not the intention of the u s to take control of facilities
3942245 i strongly doubt that russian prime minister vladimir putin is going to be deterred by the prospect of a u s humanitarian effort
3942246 oh i was just telling everyone about a prank back in college
3942247 wait you pulled a prank youve got to be joking so what was this prank
3942248 well i found this ad in the back of a magazine claiming you could get ordained through the mail
3942249 saya mencuci dan menggosok semua bagian keyboard dengan sabun lalu membilasnya dengan air dan menjemurnya
3942250 semua sudah terpasang dengan baik tapi setiap kali saya tekan pedal kaki tidak terjadi apa apa
3942251 it is a common mistake to call those people insane
3942252 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3942253 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3942254 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3942255 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3942256 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
3942257 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
3942258 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited
3942259 i think you can ask the receivers he still has it
3942260 but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3942261 i said look i heard youre not talking to the media
3942262 he said its not that its not that i obviously was joking on that i said look im not here to take chads spot or replace him or whatever it is what it is
3942263 i said this the other day i dont think ive ever beaten chad
3942264 why crawl when you can just bring me my toys
3942265 mo has the ability to space the floor hes shown himself to be a good shooter
3942266 i like him hes a competitive player that can make big shots and that is capable of rising to important times and obviously we want to be playing in those times
3942267 all these guys are very excited they respect mo as a player and theyre looking forward to playing with him
3942268 i think this is a move to be able to get a talented young 25 year old point guard that can be part of the future
3942269 his most productive days in the nba were just a few short years ago when he had ray allen on one wing and on the other wing
3942270 here you say you have luke ridnour in the best possible position to be successful again as he has been in the past
3942271 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back
3942272 we understand that its a unique opportunity here specifically but weve got to do the best thing for our basketball team and we feel like the best thing for our basketball team is to add some toughness and some intangibles defensively for us at that position
3942273 hola familia aqu traigo a las dos mamis mami maria y mami lilli
3942274 acquiring mo strengthens our nucleus of players for both the short and long term
3942275 he is entering his prime nba years and will be part of the foundation of our future success
3942276 hay tanta negatividad en este momento en el mundo elegiria las historias grandes pero serian posiitivas
3942277 swift appears to suggest in his essay that the impoverished irish might ease their economic troubles by selling children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies
3942278 ia mesti menanti sampai besok diwaktu air pasang barulah ia lolos dari penderitaannya ini
3942279 mustahilkah besok di waktu air pasang ada orang yang datang membantu
3942280 kau bilang besok bakal ada orang datang membantu apakah artinya pembilanganmu itu
3942281 besok pada waktu begini batu yang menindih tubuh saudara auwyang bakal disingkirkan
3942282 kalau sebentar dia sudah bangun minta dia datang untuk menolongi orang
3942283 aku telah kasih dia minum arak yang wangi bernama mabok seratus hari di dalam tempo tiga bulan mungkin dia tak akan mendusin
3942284 kalau bukan sekarang kita goda dia kita hendak tunggu kapan lagi
3942285 benarkah sebentar diwaktu air pasang bakal datang orang membantui kita
3942286 diwaktu air pasang aku ada mempunyai daya untuk menolongi keponakannya itu
3942287 kalau mereka itu sudah tidak ada kita bertiga dapat berdiam dengan aman di sini tidakkah itu bagus
3942288 entah bagaimana dengan enci bok sekarang suhu telah menyuruh aku menjadi pangcu dari kay pang karena itu aku pun jadi memikirkan itu kawanan pengemis
3942289 maka itu aku pikir lebih baik kita pikirkan daya untuk berlalu dari sini
3942290 memang siapa yang sangat menginginkan itu kau tahu di belakang hari tentu bakal ada orang yang memanggil ibu kepadaku nah kau duduklah
3942291 aku juga tidak tahu pernah aku tanya ayah ayah bilang
3942292 urusan mendapat anak itu nanti juga kamu mendapat tahu sendiri sekarang air pasang mau naik pula
3942293 kau yang bilang diwaktu air pasang bakal ada orang datang membantu kita urusan ini mengenai jiwa manusia bukannya urusan main main
3942294 ayahku pandai ilmu meramalkan putrinya pasti mengerti juga ilmu itu tiga bagian
3942295 untuk urusan remeh ini kenapa aku mesti sampai mengganggu ayahku laginya jikalau ayah dapat melihatmu mana dia sudi mengasih ampun apakah yang kau buat girang
3942296 coba kau tolong mencari bongkot pohon semakin banyak semakin bagus pula pilihlah yang besar besar
3942297 dia pun hapal kiu im cin keng kalau dia terus dikasih tinggal hidup di belakang hari dia bakal menjadi bahaya untuk pihakku
3942298 sampai kapan aku dapat mencapai ilmu seperti ynag dipunyakan kau ini
3942299 aku hanya lagi memikirkan tiga soal yang aku merasakan kesulitannya
3942300 yang kedua dan yang ketiga memang sulit sekali sungguh itu dapat membuat orang tidak berdaya
3942301 yang pertama tama yaitu dengan cara bagaimana dia dapat mengobati lukaku di sini tak ada tabib tak ada obat aku si pengemis tua menyerah saja kepada takdir lihat saja aku bakal mati atau bisa hidup terus yang kedua itu ialah bagaimana caranya untuk melawan auwyang hong si licin dan berbisa itu dia suka berbalik pikir maka dia tak lah dapat dipercaya habis segala pembilangannya dia sangat lihay kamu berdua tidak nanti bisa menempur padanya yang ketiga ialah soal bagaimana kita bisa dapat pulang ke daratan benar bukan yong jie
3942302 inilah soal sangat penting untuk kita soal bagaikan bencana di depan mata aku memikir jalan untuk dapat mengendalikan si tua bangka berbisa itu walaupun tidak sempurna asal dia dapat dibikin tidak berani memandang sebelah mata kepada kita
3942303 melihat keadaan sekarang ini kita mesti melawan si bisa bangkotan itu dengan otak bukannya dengan tenaga
3942304 kamu semua keluar serahkan gua ini padaku untuk aku merawat keponakanku
3942305 sekalipun giok hong taytee yang tinggal disini dia juga mesti keluar
3942306 sebentar kamu membawakan barang makanan untuk kami berdua dan kau dua makhluk cilik jikalau kamu main gila dengan barang makanan itu hati hati jiwamu bertiga
3942307 kamu tunggu sebentar di sini akan aku mencari tempat yang baru
3942308 terang sudah di sini tak pernah ada manusia lihat binatang ini tidak takut orang
3942309 sudah engko ceng tak usah kau pergi mencari tempat lagi
3942310 untuk sementara kita berdiam di atas pohon ini bagaikan burung
3942311 biarlah mereka itu berdiam di dalam gua bagai binatang binatang berkaki empat
3942312 bilang yong jie kau hendak memberikan makanan atau tidak kepada mereka
3942313 sekarang ini kita belum mendapat jalan kita pun tidak dapat melawan pada si tua bangka berbisa itu
3942314 bahwa yang kosong itu berisi dan yang berisi ialah kosong si tua bangka berbisa itu pasti menduga kita menaruhkan racun di daging yang kita berikan padanya dia tak sudi kena diakali tetapi aku aku justru menghendaki dia terpedaya
3942315 umpama kata si tua bangka berbisa tidak menukar bukankah kita bakal makan daging yang kotor dan bau itu
3942316 anak anak yang tolol kalau benar dia tidak menukarnya apakah kamu tidak dapat makan daging bau pesing itu
3942317 malam ini kau mesti menyediakan untukku seratus potong balok yang besar
3942318 kalau kurang sepotong saja kakikmu sebelah akan kuhajar patah kalau kurang dua dua duanya kakimu patah semua
3942319 laginya malam gelap buta rata seperti ini cara bagaimana orang mencarinya dan mengerjakannya
3942320 budak cilik kau banyak bacot lekas kau rawati keponakanku ada apa hubungannya kau dengan urusan si bocah cilik ini pergi kau kalau kau main gila siksaan akan menjadi bagianmu
3942321 kakekku ayahku juga aku semasa kecilku kita menderita sangat dari bangsa kim kita menjadi budak maka itu apakah artinya kesengsaraan seperti ini
3942322 siapa sangka kemudian suhu menjadi stau ahli silat kenamaan dan ketua dari partai pengemis kalau sekarang aku bersabar boleh apakah
3942323 karena itu tentulah dia sangat membenci sekali padaku kalau malam ini aku bisa menyediakan seratus batang mungkin lain malam ia akan meminta seribu batang lagi
3942324 taruh kata tempat ini bukan pulau kosong siapa yang dapat menolongi kita
3942325 ah kiu im cin keng kepandaian dua tangan kiri dan kanan saling berkelahi sendiri
3942326 tetapi kiu im cin keng ada pelajaran istimewa seperti istimewanya cara berkelahi dengan dua tangan itu kenapa aku tidak hendak menyakinkan itu bersama yong jie menyakinkan terus bersama sama siang dan malam sampai tiba saatnya mengadu jiwa dengan si tua bangka berbisa itu
3942327 suhu kehilangan kepandaiannya tetapi tidak ingatannya ia dapat memberi petunjuk padaku
3942328 sekarang coba kau membaca perlaha lahan bunyinya kiu im cin keng
3942329 nanti aku lihat ada daya apa yang dapat mempercepat pernyakinanmu
3942330 orang tahu dengan duduk berdiam dia akan memperoleh kemajuan tetapi dia tahu untuk mencapai kemahiran dibutuhkan keinsyafan ketenangan dan kecerdasan tubuh dan pikiran harus bekerja berbareng kita harus bergerak seperti berdiam walaupun kita dibentur kita tetap tenang
3942331 kiranya si imam busuk gemar main gila untuk memperdayakan orang
3942332 kitab kiu im cin keng memuat ilmu yang lihay luar biasa tak dapat itu dipahamkan hanya semalam dan seharian
3942333 sekarang pergilah lekas kau membuatnya duapuluh batang pohon itu menjadi sebuah getek
3942334 daya yang paling utama untukmu ialah menyingkirkan diri aku akan berdiam bersama yong jie di sini aku akan melihat selatan
3942335 see tok jeri terhadap oey lao shia tidak nanti dia mencelakai yong jie
3942336 pukulan itu ada sedikit aneh coba kau mengulanginya sekali lagi
3942337 sebenarnya inilah pukulan kong beng kun yang terdiri dari tujuhpuluh dua jurus yang diajarkan oleh ciu toako
3942338 dia menganggur tiap hari lantas ia menciptakan ilmu pukulannya itu dia mengajarkan aku enambelas huruf yang menjadi rahasia tipu silatnya itu ialah berhasil besar seperti pecah kegunaannya tak buruk terlalu penuh seperti meletus kegunaannya tak habisnya baiklah kalau sekarang muridmu menjalankannya untuk suhu lihat
3942339 lagi pula inilah ilmu silat mahir tidak usah dijalankan lagi kau menuturkan saja untuk aku mendengarnya
3942340 sudah cukup tidak usah kau menuturkan terlebih jauh sekarang kita dapat menempur see tok
3942341 aku ketahui ini tetapi kita mesti mencari kehidupan di antara kematian kita harus mencoba menempur bahaya bukankah kau membawa pisau belati pengasihnya khu cie kee
3942342 sekarang kau pergi menebang pohon dengan memakai pisau ini dengan menggunakan ilmu silat kong beng kun itu
3942343 itulah ilmu silat pihak luar gwa kee kong beng kun sebaliknya ilmu silat pihak dalam lay kee maka kalau kau gunai kedua ilmu silat itu dengan dirangkap piasu ini tajam sehingga dapat memotong emas dan kumala apakah artinya baru pohon ingat asal diwaktu menggunai tenaga kau mengutamakan itu huruf rahasia kosong
3942344 kita tunggu saja besok biar yong jie yang memikirkannya anak ceng mendengar kau membaca kiu im cin keng aku ingat suatu apa setelah aku memikirkannya rasanya aku tidak memikir salah sekarang mari kau pegangi aku hendak aku turun untuk bersilat
3942345 tetapi kitab toh menyebutnya tubuh dan pikiran harus bergerak berbareng bergerak tapi seperti diam walaupun dibentur kita tetap tegar maka marilah kita turun
3942346 apa yang aku jalankan barusan cuma bagus dipandang gunanya tak ada
3942347 tidak tahunya sebenarnya semakin berlatih dan banyak bergerak semakin baik sekarang ini sudah terlambat walaupun jiwaku ketolongan kepandaianku tidak bakal pulih kembali
3942348 anak ceng sekarang aku dapat akal untu menggertak si tua bangka berbisa itu coba kau lihat akalku bakal berjalan atau tidak
3942349 he anak campur aduk lekas kau mengelinding keluar mana yang sepuluh pohon lagi
3942350 anak ceng luruskan napasmu untuk menjaga kau tidak sampai terluka di dalam
3942351 ilmu silat kiu im cin keng ini benar benar luar biasa aku tengah terluka parah tetapi pagi ini sekali saja berlatih aku berhasil
3942352 kelihatannya si pengemis bangkotan ini menjadi terlebih lihay daripada yang sudah sudah kalau mereka bergabung menjadi satu mana sanggup aku melawan mereka tidak boleh ayal lagi aku pun mesti lekas berlatih
3942353 aku si tua bangka bisa menggeraki pula tangan dan kakiku untuk berjalan ini pun sudah membuatnya aku beruntung sekarang ini aku tidak memikirkan itulah ilmu silat yang tulen atau yang palsu yong jie adakah kau berkhawatir kemudian see tok bakal mengetahui rahasia kita ini
3942354 see tok sangat bermata tajam dan cerdas memang tak selayaknya dia dapat diakali tapi segala apa sukar diduga duga maka sekarang ini tak usahlah kita berkhawatir aku sekarang ingat kwee ceng di situ ada bahagian pelajaran menukar urat menguatkan tulang itulah luar biasa aku pikir selagi kita luang tempo baik kita sama sama menyakinkannya
3942355 pelajaranmu babak pertama sudah selesai sekarang kamu mesti beristirahat jikalau tidak pernapasanmu bisa tertutup dan akan merusak kesehatanmu sekarang begini yong jie pergi kau memasak aku bersama ceng jie akan pergi membikin getek
3942356 jikalau begitu adanya terang sudah kiu im cin keng bukannya untuk main main saja
3942357 pula tidaklah penasaran itu beberapa orang kosen yang telah berkorban jiwa untuk kitab ini
3942358 apakah sekarang kita bisa menghajar si tua bangka berbisa itu
3942359 kau masih memerlukan tempo pernyakinan tiga sampai lima tahun lagi
3942360 kalau begitu percuma kita belajar lagi lima tahun kita toh tak dapat mengalahkan dia
3942361 ada kemungkinan yang isinya kitab ada jauh terlebih lihay daripada dugaanku
3942362 all evidence that was collected back in 85 back in 94 and evidence that has been recently collected by way of interviews and everything else will be examined with every modern technology we have available to us
3942363 it was like if you or i were to commit a murder and say oh my goodness what have we done
3942364 like someone had run round the house and picked up lots of different plastic bags
3942365 all evidence that was collected back in 85 back in 94 and evidence that has been recently collected by way of interviews and everything else will be examined with every modern technology we have available to us
3942366 it was like if you or i were to commit a murder and say oh my goodness what have we done
3942367 like someone had run round the house and picked up lots of different plastic bags
3942368 all of the places that might produce information turn out to be dead ends
3942369 detectives have decided theres too much information out there and they need to be circumspect at this time
3942370 el objetivo del gobierno es convertir al teatro en una sala de alquiler donde se realicen negocios privados
3942371 el objetivo del gobierno es convertir al teatro en una sala de alquiler donde se realicen negocios privados en detrimento de sus trabajadores y de su producci n propia
3942372 el proyecto de autarqu a tiene 2 pilares fundamentales en primer lugar crea un directorio para el teatro elegido a dedo por el jefe de gobierno que va a tener que armar en un m ximo de 3 meses la estructura de personal del teatro el objetivo del macrismo es ir por una reducci n dr stica del personal macri ya inici su gesti n con miles de despidos la ley ni siquiera menciona el traslado del personal contratado al nuevo ente ante este ataque los trabajadores nos encontramos de pie para evitar el desguace del patrimonio intangible y m s importante del teatro sus trabajadores
3942373 en segundo lugar la ley habilita a hacer manejos presupuestarios por fuera de las normativas vigentes en el gobierno de la ciudad es decir legalizar el manejo discrecional de fondos para que los directivos que coloque el ejecutivo puedan hacer todo tipo de negociados con organismos privados
3942374 ante este cuadro los trabajadores planteamos no a la privatizaci n de la cultura no a la ley de autarqu a reapertura ya del teatro con todos sus trabajadores talleres y salas de ensayo ning n despido ni jubilaci n compulsiva basta de precarizaci n laboral planta permanente para los contratados 82 por ciento m vil para los jubilados aumento salarial partiendo de un sueldo b sico m nimo de 3 200 canasta familiar abajo la ley de mecenazgo investigaci n independiente sobre el presupuesto del master plan y comisi n de trabajadores que supervise la administraci n del teatro
3942375 baiklah aku mencoba dulu untuk mengetahui dia dapat berjalan atau tidak
3942376 dia telah menggunakan seribu satu akal untuk mencelakai aku mana sudi aku menolongi dia pergi kau sendiri yang menolonginya
3942377 alangkah baiknya kalau aku dapat cari suatu tempat bersembunyi untuk aku berdiam bersama suhu sambil merawati suhu tentulah si bangsat tidak gampang gampang dapat mencari kita
3942378 coba dulu aku tidak terlalu gemar memain dan aku pelajari ilmu kie bun ngo heng sekarang tentulah dapat aku melayani bangsat itu
3942379 ah sayang ayah telah menyerahkan peta tho hoa to kepadanya jahanam itu sangat cerdas tentulah ia pun dapat memahamkan peta itu
3942380 yang maha kuasa hendak membinasakan jahanam itu maka juga telah diciptakan ini batu luar biasa
3942381 kau sombongkan kepandaianmu yang lihay sekarang kau roboh di tangan kongcumu kau takluk tidak baiklah karena aku berkasihan untuk usiamu yang sudah lanjut aku menyerah untuk kau menyerang dulu tiga kali bagaimana
3942382 kenapa kau datang ke mari eh kau juga auwyang peehu kenapa kau pun datang
3942383 ah kenapa pamanku bisa datang bersama sama oey lao shia
3942384 jangan ini pun main gilanya si budak cilik ia hendak menolongi pengemis bangkotan ini dia menipu aku supaya aku keluar tapi tak apa baik aku melihat dulu pengemis ini toh tak bakal lolos dari tanganku
3942385 jikalau kau memikir untuk menyeret pula aku ke laut marilah kita mencoba coba
3942386 kalau aku tidak keburu sampai di batu itu pasti dia bakal dapat menawan aku
3942387 jikalau kau tetap menyusul aku kau nanti diterkam dan digegares olehnya
3942388 kalau ada ikan cucut di sini mana bisa aku melawan seperti ciu pek thong
3942389 ketika itu ada aku yang menolongi dia tetapi sekarang siapa yang menolongi aku
3942390 jikalau aku tidak dapat menyiksa kamu berdua bangsat cilik hingga kau mati tidak hiudp juga tidak percuma aku disebut see tok
3942391 jikalau kau tidak keluar nanti aku yang masuk ke dalam
3942392 kamu membantui aku menolongi keponakanku nanti aku beri ampun jiwanya ini penegemis tua
3942393 thian yang menurunkan batu itu menindih dia kau melihatnya dengan matamu sendiri
3942394 siapa sanggup menolongi dia jikalau kau berbuat jahat nanti thian pun melemparkan batu besar itu untuk menindih padamu sampai mampus
3942395 sesudah kami membantu kau menolongi keponakanmu itu kita tinggal bersama sama di pulau ini
3942396 selama itu kau tidak boleh mengganggu pula kami guu dan murid bertiga
3942397 selama berada di pulau ini aku pasti tidak akan turun tangan terhadap kamu tetapi nanti di daratn itulah sukar untuk atau membilangnya
3942398 sampai itu waktu biarnya kau tidak turun tangan kami yang bakal turun tangan terhadapmu
3942399 sekarang yang kedua ayahku telah menjodohkan aku dengan dia kau melihatnya sendiri kau mendengarnya sendiri juga maka itu kalau di belakang hari keponakanmu itu menggerembengi pula padaku ia lah binatang yang tak mirip miripnya sekalipun dengan anjing babi
3942400 baiklah tetapi ini pun terbatas selama kita berada di pulau ini seberlalunya kita dari sini kita lihat saja nanti
3942401 kami akan membantu kau dengan sungguh sungguh akan tetapi umpama kata thian hendak mengantarkan jiwa keponakanmu itu pulang ke alam baka itulah bukannya tenaga manusia yang dapat mencegahnya maka itu kau tidak boleh menimbulkan lain urusan lagi
3942402 jikalau keponakanku sampai mati si pengemis tua jangan harap dapat hidup lebih lama
3942403 budak cilik jangan kau ngaco belo lebih lama lekas kau tolongi keponakanku itu
3942404 kalau sebentar see tok membantu mendorong batu besar itu kau gunai ketikamu untuk membokong dia untuk membikin habis jiwanya
3942405 tetapi kita telah mengeluarkan kata kata harus kita pegang itu
3942406 sekarang kita tolongi dulu keponakannya itu nanti di belakang hari kita mencari jalan untuk membuat pembalasan
3942407 jikalau kau hendak menolongi jiwa gurumu lekas kau tolongi keponakanku ini
3942408 ilmu luar dari guruku lihay sekali tenaganya besar luar biasa dengan kita berempat bekerja sama mestinya batu ini dapat digeser
3942409 jangan jangan lebih baik kau tolong aku dengan membunuh aku saja
3942410 percuma aku mendidik kau banyak tahun kenapa kau tidak mempunyai semangat laki laki
3942411 kalau kau kutungi kedua kakinya apakah itu bukan berari kau mengantarkan jiwanya aku ada mempunyai satu daya entah berhasil atau tidak mari kita coba dulu
3942412 kau sangat ingin menolongi keponakanmu sekarang kau tidak mencaci dan membentak bentak aku pula bahkan memanggil aku nona yang baik

3942439 o people worship god you have no other god but he for i fear the retribution of the great day may fall on you
3942440 but have been sent by my lord the creator of all the worlds
3942441 o you people worship god for you have no other god but he will you not take heed for yourselves
3942442 we find you full of folly and a liar to boot
3942443 but have been sent by the lord of all the worlds sound familiar its noah version 2 0 only this time his people think hes a stupid liar 68 i bring to you the messages of my lord i am your sincere friend 69 do you wonder that a warning has come to you from your lord through a man who is one of you and warns you remember he made you leaders after the people of noah and gave you a greater increase in your stature so think of the favours of god you may haply be blessed
3942444 have you come to say to us that we should worship only one god abandoning those our ancestors had worshipped if so bring on us what you threaten us with if what you say is true
3942445 you have already been beset with punishment and the wrath of god why dispute with me about names invented by you and your ancestors for which no sanction was sent down so wait for what is to come i am waiting with you
3942446 worship god for you have no other god but he clear proof has come to you already from your lord and this she camel of god is the token for you leave her free to graze upon gods earth and do not molest her lest a grievous punishment should befall you
3942447 ask your lord to make a she camel which must be 10 months pregnant tall and attractive issue from the rock for us

3942450 o my people i conveyed to you the message of my lord and warned you but you do not like those who wish you well

3942454 we shall drive you away from our land o shuaib and those who are with you unless you come back to your faith
3942455 even if we are disgusted with it 89 we shall only be guilty of blaspheming god if we accept your way after the people of noah and gave you a greater increase in your stature so think of the favours of god you may haply be blessed
3942456 if you follow shuaib and his way you will surely be ruined
3942457 o people i conveyed to you the message of my lord and warned you but you paid no heed how can i grieve for a people who do not believe

3942460 and we believe a strong movie deserves a strong playdate
3942461 there has to be some sort of correlation between the moratorium ending and these stocks being down
3942462 if the sec wanted to protect these companies artificially it served its purpose
3942463 eighty percent of the industry has good traceback 20 doesnt and they put all of us at risk
3942464 a faster system would allow us to exclude products faster and give you a source faster
3942465 it depends on how much it is and how they justify it
3942466 i know their costs have gone up but if the fee gets too bad they lose because people wont sign up and a lot of us may not do the volunteer work weve been doing for them in rec programs either
3942467 were hoping to recover some of the subsidy to the townships
3942468 i always had a sense that we were subsidizing the townships and the same thing is probably true in the fire department township residents are probably paying less than shakopee citizens are we definitely dont want to be subsidizing some other government
3942469 one of the biggest dissatisfiers to customers is when at the time they want to sell their vehicles if its lost a lot of value
3942470 i didnt really foresee when i leased the replacement vehicle that the market would tank like this
3942471 two of my friends and i went on a month long road trip beginning in monterey crossing the nation and entering canada at niagara then falling south to new orleans and finally taking route 66 back home we stopped along most of the major cities and a few of the more prominent national parks along the way
3942472 i hope you enjoyed it because youre not going to have an opportunity like that for a really long time
3942473 you wont have an opportunity like that again for a really long time
3942474 part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups hispanics in particular
3942475 those groups also tend to be more of the childbearing age non hispanic white people tend to be a little bit older
3942476 thus one in three u s residents would be hispanic
3942477 theyre in a higher mortality rate nonminority groups tend to be older and dying off faster

3942500 potential treasure trove of information on terrorist supporters sympathizers or sleepers in the united states and overseas
3942501 i have one eye looking very closely at developments back home i speak to people i have family there but im not going to rush anything
3942502 ive been here a long time i have a family here and its not just a case of upping and leaving and going back theres a lot to take into account i know a lot of zimbabwean professionals who are in a similar situation
3942503 i need to be able to go back and set myself up with a job that allows me to provide for my family both my immediate family and the extended family and that is not going to happen overnight
3942504 political stability is essential and other things will fall into place after that but it will take time
3942505 right now the risk takers are already taking up positions
3942506 even the regular man on the street in zimbabwe right now is very entrepreneurial he has to be or otherwise he wont make enough to survive i think that entrepreneurial spirit is going to be carried forward and so people will have to be sharp
3942507 a lot of colleagues and professionals living here in england have already developed their networks back home for me it wouldnt take me more than a few months to go back even if it might take five years for the situation to really turn around or even for the exchange rate to stabilise
3942508 there are many many people who would want to return and contribute to the rebuilding of zimbabwe but there is still uncertainty and a lack of clarity about what role the diaspora would play
3942509 there are people who have been tortured raped people whose families have been killed do they want to return right away without knowing if there will be justice
3942510 i think many people will wait to see how the situation develops to make sure that there is no longer violence that inflation has gone down perhaps it will be one or two years
3942511 i think you will see zimbabweans making new ties testing the water to go back but not leaving everything theyve got here because they cant afford to go back and lose everything
3942512 people with money to invest whether in property or small businesses or mineral processing they are ready but the time is not yet its still some time off

3942527 its amazing how they just freeze and you can catch them
3942528 were trying to work in the community to bring people back to the rivers both here in dayton and the broader river corridor from piqua to hamilton
3942529 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
3942530 we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3942531 as long as people believe in absurdities they will continue to commit atrocities

3942536 were building great facilities that are environmentally sound great for technology that get our students prepared for the world of work theyll face when they leave duval county public schools
3942537 well be more prepared this time well have our song choices in line before we get there and well be more confident
3942538 its opened a lot of doors for people in jacksonville who may not have had the opportunity to go out and travel to find the stardom it came to us so were happy for that
3942539 we cannot stay still the world has changed theres a jetset that travels all over the world because they are interested in the formula one races
3942540 why i dont know i find very little excitement in it they wheel around and around and its over and theres an accident so what but im told there is tremendous excitement in the way you get the cars the way you change wheels the way you drive and so on
3942541 we will not practice this afternoon we will meet this afternoon instead were well ahead on our repetitions and so we feel good about that it will also give the coaches the opportunity this afternoon which they have not had to work on green bay a little bit so we can get better prepared for that but we will meet this afternoon players will meet watch some film and get off their legs it will be good for us no decision on the quarterback ive got nothing to report as far as that goes as far as playing time or anything like that were meeting on that today thats about it
3942542 well hopefully this afternoon were meeting on several things but hopefully thats one of the topics
3942543 jason hill got back to practice today i would hope that things went well enough that when he goes in he checks ok i think so we hope to have him in the game obviously arnaz battle will be out for the game
3942544 the severity i dont know but hes not likely to play
3942545 i told the team that but otherwise im kind of wasting an opportunity to get an uplift but they did practice well i thought it did help telling them i did think before i was just going to wait until the end of practice to say heres what were going to do but it did uplift them they ran around so it was good
3942546 whatever you have to do to keep going there were no goalposts though
3942547 no although he kicked a pretty nice one the other day he drove that thing through after he kicked it joe came up to me i looked at joe and i said joe that was a nice kick and joe said coach his adrenaline right now is running so fast he said you cant imagine i said well i hope he kicks this one out he said well if adrenaline has anything to do with it hes going to put it pretty deep so that was nice i was pleased he hit it though
3942548 it would be at most a quarter but well see if its that much what well do is well say a number of plays or a quarter whichever one comes first so whatever that comes out to be
3942549 every situation is different for ever player for this reason they have the same system in everything that theyve been doing in san diego and hes ladainian tomlinson been healthy so if they dont play him as theyve done in the past ive noticed from time to time that fits with what theyve got going obviously franks last year was because he was injured in our case because of the offense and because of frank needing to get some plays obviously i want to get him some
3942550 well determine that tonight whatever it is it will be minimal if he gets some but i would hope he gets some because it is at home but its not necessarily critical that we do it so well wait and see what happens
3942551 i heard he found a job well youd always like for him to go to another team but thats ok i want brandon to do well hes a good guy a good person he deserves good things and thats probably a good situation for him
3942552 i dont know yet well talk about that tonight the reason i say that is if he was a real young player and we need to get him a lot of work thats one thing but he needs to get work because hes unfamiliar with the system but hes also played about 9 or 10 years whatever it is so ive got to gauge that so well see
3942553 weve always felt that way about tony but tony is getting better with the opportunity hes had
3942554 kind of yeah a lot of teams have those kinds of guys big tough no nonsense smart guys
3942555 as ive said before those two positions kind of go together so well have to see what our numbers are to have five guys at the two spots its a possibility if i put them all together in the past its typically been four but again the final roster as you well know is the whole thing when youre trying to get 53 everything affects it if two fullbacks makes us better than a sixth wide receiver or something like that then you take away from one and add to another
3942556 i really dont have a good answer for you just got to get back on the field and practice
3942557 he has enough that we consider it if he doesnt play at all but if he gets back out here say next week then hes got a couple weeks to do something
3942558 no tomorrow will be an in season thursday so tomorrow will be thursday
3942559 oh forgive me well its a 9 oclock start for the players on the field anyway were on the field at 11 30 a m
3942560 the message was not only about physical conditioning but the importance of mental conditioning and the mind game between players
3942561 if we were playing ping pong we would have a little mind game i would hope at least thats how i play ping pong set you up slam it a couple of times then i get you back up and get a little blooper im coming after you its contact ping pong thats all i can tell you
3942562 you mean where sometimes they help and sometimes they dont
3942563 yeah sometimes its not just how much they know its their personality introvert versus extrovert things like that
3942564 yeah i have a pretty good idea already we just have to make that happen thats all
3942565 how well we practice will determine if we practice this afternoon i want it up tempo all practice long
3942566 i think we were already fired up for practice but when he told us that i think it just added a bit more fuel to the fire
3942567 whenever you get the opportunity to make a play everybody wants to step up and make that play
3942568 i was in a zone drop and i was able to get back and set up in my zone and read the quarterback and make a good break
3942569 anytime you make plays its definitely on the coaches minds so it was a good thing that i was able to make that play
3942570 joe is consistent that is the least of our concerns
3942571 if joe is kicking to determine whether we practice or not thats pretty much automatic we knew we werent going to practice there was no stress right there
3942572 we have had a pretty good camp so far and weve come out each day and worked to get better and i think coach has seen that
3942573 a good deed never goes undone and i think thats what he was doing
3942574 you can run all you like but youve got to play football to be in football shape
3942575 so ive tried to get as many reps as i could but im not going to lie the afternoon off thats huge huge we go hard every day and give it our all so to get some rest is great my feet are very tired so ill be staying off of them and probably going to bed by 8 tonight
3942576 the quarterback can catch his own pass but hes got to run with it only
3942577 he cant throw another forward pass you only get one
3942578 michael is plain silly and hes always messing with coach so i think nolan just wanted to leave him out of the fun to get him back
3942579 you sat right there and watched him try to throw my man and didnt flag him
3942580 i used to do it in when i was coaching in san diego
3942581 i get two balls painted wet them down and it makes the guys focus on the ball more they know its slippery so theyre actually concentrating on trying to catch the heart of the ball
3942582 its better than always throwing them a ball or using the juggs machine it gets in their mind and they think about it they really focus on the ball and see if they can catch it
3942583 its one of the things as linebackers we try to improve on
3942584 when we are coming out of a break were trying to get our hands on the ball today we were playing in weather conditions because you never know when it could be raining and you might have to catch a wet ball or your hands could be sweaty there are all different kinds of conditions you have to catch a ball in
3942585 when the ball comes you have to make a play on the ball its all about being a play maker
3942586 you never know when an opportunity will present itself and that one opportunity can decide if you win or lose the game
3942587 im still a little bit sore i felt a little fresher than what i was it was good to get my legs back under me
3942588 i can afford to shortcut my time with the lord this morning
3942589 god has never once let me down and hes not goign to start now
3942590 gods will is exactly what we would choose if we knew what god knows when we stand in eternity looking back on this earthly existence we will know by sight what we can only see now by faith he has done all things well
3942591 being a mother has taught me more about the grace of god and my own shortcomings than any other experience in my life i see gods grace every morning as they wake up healthy and strong as they laugh and giggle as they run and play as their minds develop right before my eyes my biggest lesson learned is to cherish every moment with your children they grow too fast god never gives you more than you can handle and i am going to do all that i can for my little ones especially when they face challenges
3942592 true some of the lessons theyve taught me were not very fun as they were happening but the good moments mix up with the not so good moments in a wonderful curriculum ordained for me by god himself
3942593 i honestly can say that being a mother is the most powerful and important feeling in the world
3942594 god gave me strength when i couldnt go on life when my body was trying to shut down encouragement to my broken heart meals when the refrigerator was empty a place to live when ends did not meet peace in the midst of turmoil and a contentment that went beyond my circumstances sure life gets hard now and then my heart may still become anxious and my mind may begin to assume the worse but today i know that contentment comes from within i have learned to be content regardless of my circumstances because god is faithful to me i am so very blessed
3942595 this is the place i come to share my stories thoughts prayers battles struggles and victories as a christian mom
3942596 thanks to the help and prayers of everyone inside and outside the hospital and all over the world we once again have triumphed over this trial
3942597 really really good i went through a stage when i was in high school when it wasnt so good but now im at a stage where i really appreciate her a lot more
3942598 i think it is more urban im writing every day right here at the piano in this living room this is my best work ever
3942599 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit
3942600 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3942601 they had a great time together but they are just in different places in their lives right now

3942610 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3942611 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3942612 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3942613 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3942614 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3942615 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3942616 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3942617 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3942618 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3942619 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3942620 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3942621 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3942622 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3942649 he has energized a lot of people around the world and so i think he is worth listening to and seeing what he stands for
3942650 he likes and admires john mccain and that would be a factor in anything he does if he decides to get more involved
3942651 and likes him and is looking for a reason to vote for him he hasnt found it yet
3942652 i will ultimately vote for the person i believe brings to the american people the kind of vision the american people want to see for the next four years

3942658 accused russia on august 5 of violating the countrys airspace and firing a guided missile
3942659 israel has decided to halt all sales of military equipment to georgia because of russias objections to give israel leverage with moscow not to ship arms and equipment to iran
3942660 there has been no decision by israel to stop selling us weapons
3942661 israeli companies have been helping the georgian army prepare for war against russia through arms deals training of infantry and security advice

3942665 the most immediate us task is to make certain that no state or combination of states gains the capacity to expel the united states from eurasia or even to diminish significantly its decisive arbitration role
3942666 los europeos son muy individualistas y los asi ticos son muy colectivistas ellos toman las decisiones en grupo y no le dan tanta importancia al individuo
3942667 en cualquier caso lo importante es que este estudio revela que lo que pens bamos que era universal no lo es por lo que debemos tener cuidado a la hora de generalizar
3942668 no diferenciamos a los chinos porque al no convivir con ellos no estamos habituados a reconocer a gente con esos rasgos no estamos entrenados para ello
3942669 para ello deber an formar parte de nuestro entorno personal de nuestra vida deber amos conocerlos y esforzarnos por distinguir entre uno y otro pero como normalmente no tenemos esa necesidad de acercamiento los acabamos metiendo a todos en el mismo saco
3942670 no las reconocemos bien porque tendemos a clasificar a las personas como de nuestro grupo o de fuera de nuestro grupo seg n su clase social aficiones y otros par metros entre los que se encuentra la raza
3942671 con frecuencia las personas dividen el mundo entre nosotros y ellos es decir dividen en grupos sociales seg n su raza nacionalidad u ocupaci n
3942672 no estamos acostumbrados a mirar las diferencias entre chinos igual que no sabr amos diferenciar entre 12 tipos de nieve como hacen los esquimales
3942673 es un mecanismo muy com n al que recurrimos porque no podemos asimilar toda la informaci n al mismo nivel de espeficidad los asi ticos tambi n lo hacen porque ellos tambi n nos perciben iguales a nosotros y por eso nos engloban dentro del grupo de los occidentales
3942674 n s queremos os recursos naturais mas vamos dizer que por causa de armas de destrui o em massa

3942678 they went up the chain of command in vietnam but by the time they came out the other end they changed
3942679 what normally happens at the end of a conflict they have a thing called the end of war list an end of war review and you go back through what alterations were made to recommendations over the time of that conflict
3942680 these particular issues werent considered as part of that end of war review
3942681 i guess the important point and what we should focus on today is very much the fact that the gallantry of these men but also of d company as a whole and all those involved is being duly recognised finally
3942682 during a scuffle a shot was fired and he fell to the ground and received a single gunshot to the back of the head
3942683 he doesnt know who it is and he doesnt know why
3942684 all he knows is that he was kicked punched and shot in the back of the head
3942685 he is very lucky to be alive the bullet has gone behind his left ear and the fragments are still there
3942686 i dont know anything about what happened i dont know was he shot
3942687 if he was shot it is not unusual for this area

3942690 we were seeing 35 45 to 50 miles an hour traffic
3942691 we saw people just flying through here usually this is a race track during the day
3942692 we cant have residents unilaterally put their own speed bumps because that would create chaos for us across the city
3942693 these problems have been emerging for the last six to twelve years
3942694 we have a record of inaction by our predecessors what weve done is taken every possible measure available to us in the last six months to try and turn this disaster around
3942695 i mean weve got nick xenophon who has been in the riverland promising them the world and then goes down to the lower lakes and promises them the world in terms of water
3942696 i dont know what he says when he goes to the riverland and then says oh by the way that water that i promised you will be coming sailing past you you arent going to use it for your farms it will end up in the lower lakes where it will evaporate
3942697 we strongly encourage the committee to develop and evaluate a scenario that places tolls on both sr 520 and i 90 on 2010
3942698 im like every taxpayer everything sounds like too much to me that sounds expensive
3942699 theyve got to think usually you dont want to pay for something thats not already there let us pay for it after its built
3942700 you wont find anyone who will say gee golly i want to pay tolls
3942701 we want as many cooks as we can get in this kitchen
3942702 they just made her ms donnelly smile they were everything to her
3942703 shes trying to be strong for her little one who she has at the moment
3942704 it was like the whole square of the house was one big thick stack of smoke
3942705 i got about six foot in the front door and thats as far as i could go as there was a wall of smoke thick black smoke hitting me like a black jacket in the face
3942706 i came back and got a shirt and a torch and was right to go again but couldnt get any further
3942707 we put him through some things here the last couple of days and it looks like hes in pretty good shape i think hes handled the last few days very well

3942711 for those seeking a vacation home alternative in the bahamas the ritz carlton club provides a lifestyle like no other
3942712 it affords a carefree home ownership experience complete with a staff of dedicated ladies and gentlemen to assist members with their every need this island destination and specifically the abaco club is the ideal setting to expand our growing brand
3942713 the key ingredient to this new concept is member feedback
3942714 our members told us they are looking for enhanced flexibility when using their second homes as a result we designed a program as diverse as their travel plans
3942715 will john mccain turn tsar putins invasion of georgia into a drill drill drill issue he should it will throw democrats even more on the defensive especially sen obama whose weak response to putins neo soviet actions have already put him way behind the eight ball on russia
3942716 mccain is doing a live press conference on the russia georgia conflict
3942717 with the obama campaign saying mccains statements about georgia are aggressive and belligerent and very aggressive and very belligerent at that it might be time to remind ourselves of harry jaffas words written for barry goldwater once upon a time moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue i think it should be noted that nothing mccain has said is as aggressive as the actions of russia it strikes me odd right now to complain of aggressive words in the defense of democracy rather than condemning aggressive actions against a democracy
3942718 having overestimated the power of the soviet union in its last years we have consistently underestimated the ambitions of russia since already a great deal has been said about the implications of russias invasion for ukraine the baltic states and europe generally but few have noticed the direct strategic threat of moscows action to u s efforts in iraq and afghanistan the kremlin is not about to reignite the cold war for the love of a few thousand ossetians or even for its animosity toward five million georgians this is calculated strategic maneuvering
3942719 beyond this bush has presented a list of things he expects russia to do
3942720 the whiplash policy reversals that have marked bushs second term have already moved u s foreign policy into carter mode
3942721 its incredibly ironic that shes released from jail for his attempted murder and within five hours of her return home hes dead
3942722 cabinet will then look at what further measures will be possible to reduce the pressure on the system
3942723 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years

3942725 wherever i go i try to put out feelers for artifacts and stories from each town i visit
3942726 about every place i have gone i have been told many stories and people have said that they have artifacts to contribute
3942727 i think there will be a personal connection for people when they see artifacts from their own town
3942728 i did not know that the ufa had competition when starting up im glad that it did form and that they are still in business

3942753 mungkin kita hanya perlu bersahabat dengan keadaan supaya mereka juga mau bersahabat dengan kita bukankah bersahabat dengan diri sendiri itu membantu kita lebih mengerti ingin seperti apa kita ingin melayani dan dilayani

3943069 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires
3943070 i have said these things to you that in me you may have peace in the world you will have tribulation but take heart i have overcome the world
3943071 here is a word for word translation of this statement directly from the greek
3943072 verbs which end in o generally mean to bring out that which a person is or that which is desired they do not have reference to the mode in which the action takes place in the case of dikaio it means either to bring out the fact that a person is righteous or if he is not to make him righteous to justify someone therefore means to bring out the fact that he is just or to make him just without necessarily referring to how he is made just
3943073 do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also

3943080 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3943081 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3943082 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3943083 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3943084 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3943085 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3943086 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3943087 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3943088 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3943089 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3943090 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3943091 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3943092 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3943125 what we know is that if you see a very frail person next to somebody not so frail the very frail person is more likely to have alzheimers pathology in their brain when they die
3943126 this is important as we try to wrap our heads around the biology of aging
3943127 because it turns out that as you get older alzheimers pathology signs of its development are really ubiquitous even if that doesnt mean that you actually have dementia so this finding could alter the way most medical and non medical people conceptualize alzheimers as a disease simply of impaired memory and cognition while expanding our view of what it actually means to become frail
3943128 part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups hispanics in particular
3943129 those groups also tend to be more of the childbearing age non hispanic white people tend to be a little bit older
3943130 thus one in three u s residents would be hispanic
3943131 theyre in a higher mortality rate nonminority groups tend to be older and dying off faster

3943139 ive truly relished working with my longtime partner tom cruise to revitalize united artists and i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years reinvigorating the brand and developing such a strong slate of films
3943140 as much as ive enjoyed my time as an executive i have longed to return to my true love which is making movies so thats what ive decided to do

3943146 i had a phone internet account with rcn and they keep providing me shitty unreliable service i made the stupid mistake of getting cable with them a few weeks ago and the price they promised me was about half of what they are actually charging me i even asked the lady on the telephone what all their extra taxes and fees would amount to and she told me 3 or 4 well they are hitting me with a much higher price and i refuse to pay and i know they have me in a contract now where they are going to want to penalize me if i try to leave before a year so im just wondering i can fuck them off right they dont have direct access to my bank account theyll shut off service after a couple months big whoop then what happens

3943151 thats our philosophy for how to continue a parks system thats above average
3943152 the city and the economy are on a trajectory now where were going to have to make due with less financial resources
3943153 we need to bring community members into the park system
3943154 it is a huge problem that we have things that need to be maintained that are deteriorating
3943155 we kind of put money in the budget every year for whats the worst thing on the list
3943156 this appears to be the first time a government has prohibited a specific style of restaurant for health rather than aesthetic reasons
3943157 south los angeles used to know sic for liquor stores and churches but now its churches beauty supplies fast food restaurants we still have some liquor stores but not like it was before the riot in 1992 in the last 20 years four ralphs grocers stores have moved out that replaced the grocers with sub standard stores like superior grocers and fast food restaurants for example on the corner of vermont ave and slauson ave there are four fast food restaurants on that one corner there a kfc taco bell mc donalds and el pollo all on one corner obesity in south los angeles is up over 50 in the last 15 years they took out the grocers stores and put in fast food restaurants there need to put in first class grocers stores like ralphs vons and trade joe where people can have better choices
3943158 the crime in all of this is that people are sitting around meddling into the very minutiae of what people are putting in their mouths
3943159 its insulting and you could almost infer a racial insult out of the interference
3943160 poor people like children as less capable of free choice
3943161 no one is forced to go onto any restaurant and the fast food restaurants employ many people especially young people from right in the community the poor community right thee in the neighborhood and these restaurants are all built with private funds therefore the government has no business and no right to get involved its fascist
3943162 adult obesity accounts for over 12 of adult medicaid expenditures

3943196 para la pr xima d cada hay un horizonte internacional que promete precios m s altos que el promedio de esta y la anterior est n los biocombustibles ampliando el horizonte de negocios y mejorando las cuentas de la argentina con el mundo en suma existe un marco de razonable bonanza y previsibilidad que justifica intentar un acuerdo para incrementar fuertemente la producci n
3943197 pero hay que hacerlo con una agenda predefinida y consistente que implique incluso una mayor intervenci n del gobierno en el sector hay que tener muy presente que todos los pa ses que tuvieron un desarrollo agropecuario de relieve contaron con fuertes pol ticas de intervenci n en el sector como los estados unidos canad y la uni n europea
3943198 para disminuir el proceso de exclusi n en el sector de la peque a y mediana empresa se requiere financiamiento inversiones capacitaci n y la incorporaci n de tecnolog as adecuadas y adaptadas a sus condiciones de producci n gesti n y organizaci n
3943199 los ingredientes que har n posibles esa cifras son un aumento del 20 por ciento en el rea sembrada incrementos tecnol gicos de la productividad pautas de ordenamiento del territorio que aporten racionalidad a nuevas limitantes como son hoy la tierra el agua y el espacio integraci n vertical de producciones y procesos y fuertes inversiones para remover carencias de infraestructura

3943204 if she does go its nothing shes done in the house only what shes done in the diary room
3943205 youve got to think about that not everyone is what they seem
3943206 i dont agree with it but i will melt the chocolate
3943207 are you sure this is a good idea i dont think it is
3943208 i thought i could but im not down with it
3943209 mo has the ability to space the floor hes shown himself to be a good shooter
3943210 i like him hes a competitive player that can make big shots and one of those guys that is capable of rising to important times and obviously we want to be playing in those times
3943211 all these guys are very excited they respect mo as a player and theyre looking forward to playing with him
3943212 i think this is a move to be able to get a talented young 25 year old point guard that can be part of the future
3943213 his most productive days in the nba were just a few short years ago when he had ray allen on one wing and rashard lewis on the other wing
3943214 here you say you have michael redd on one wing and richard jefferson on another wing youre putting luke ridnour in the best possible position to be successful again as he has been in the past
3943215 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back
3943216 we understand that its a unique opportunity here specifically but weve got to do the best thing for our basketball team and we feel like the best thing for our basketball team is to add some toughness and some intangibles defensively for us at that position
3943217 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
3943218 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3943219 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
3943220 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3943221 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3943222 i am thinking about my doorbell when are you going to ring my doorbell
3943223 who the hell would watch people play cards on the tv
3943224 we stood up well because we were so young in the middle of the park
3943225 of course for a game of that level you could be worried but i have confidence in them and i must say i have been paid back very well
3943226 we expected a difficult game and we were not disappointed they man marked us all over the pitch and we needed to be patient and not make any mistakes at the back
3943227 we changed a bit tactically at half time but most important they dropped their level a bit to do what they did in the first half to tackle for every ball is of course very difficult and from then on we looked a bit more comfortable
3943228 its a massive mountain to climb its bigger than everest but we take heart from the performance
3943229 i said before that this game isnt just about now but also the future i like what i see of this team we showed we are a good team who can compete with the likes of
3943230 we go away thinking 2 0 is an unbelievable result because of the performance we put in
3943231 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half
3943232 we couldnt all be cowboys so some of us are clowns
3943233 i do not mind the idea of such a camp but i do think that the fundamental premise by which it is being constructed is false if they are to critically think about everything then the very assumptions by which the camps ideological premises are constructed should also be questioned
3943234 think of the library system as something akin to the open source movement
3943235 the first defendant and the second defendant were notified of the listing today
3943236 it would appear at this stage there is no appearance
3943237 it was a public road and the toll was put on it by the previous coalition government
3943238 we did commit in 1995 to remove the toll the contract prevented us from doing that without massive payment from the taxpayers so we introduced cashback
3943239 in 2010 the concession period ends and the toll is scheduled to come off
3943240 we still see the sirens as an important part of our pathway towards the tall ferns and hope this is not the end of the concept
3943241 while their fate is sealed this season we still intend moving the franchise to another city and establishing a new management structure that can sustain it on a long term basis
3943242 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
3943243 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3943244 in the next five to ten years i see more consolidation in every region of the world
3943245 we should expect to see chinese automakers exporting to north america soon as well as european manufacturers bringing their small cars here to manufacture and sell here as well as export back home to take advantage of the weak dollar
3943246 the rest of the regions its going to be more about working with other companies on say platforms or specific deals on buying products
3943247 were not going to be putting any name plate on it until we can be rest assured it meets all of our standards
3943248 that has been the biggest delay in that product program it did not meet our standards
3943249 no one is going to buy a car company like this in the market that its in and expect okay why dont we see if we can go sell it now after one year
3943250 it was ricky who helped make history in the house of pain
3943251 personally i think ricky has proved himself as south africas leading scrumhalf is it fouries world cup status that now elevates him above ricky
3943252 in my view fourie has done nothing to justify a place in the starting lineup
3943253 conrad jantjes is on present form the no 1 fullback it is worrying that people make decisions with their heart to give someone montgomery his 100th test cap
3943254 i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
3943255 we have also seen nothing of the new type of rugby that peter has spoken of
3943256 it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands
3943257 is the team that has been selected of such a nature that it will ensure the support of most south africans
3943258 we cannot repeat the cycle of the white era we must build for 2011
3943259 it is easy to fall into a comfort zone peter should be reminded of his mandate its not all about transformation but it is an important part of it not one black player has let south africa down this year
3943260 mulai tadi malam kami sudah memantau beberapa gunung api yang biasa dipakai upacara

3943263 it just seems to me that edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
3943264 my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk
3943265 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
3943266 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future

3943283 k raine will have told you of my doubts on such a treatment of the painful subject of food in these times but i am glad that you agree with me that it would be unfortunate and unwise to publish it for the continental reader
3943284 its been a long long journey so long that a whole book was written about a part of it its obvious to anyone who is familiar with the story and the history that it is one of the project that to make an understatement did not turn out the way it was originally planned
3943285 if you view it from the point of view as something that would replace outlook and exchange it has completely and utterly failed
3943286 last january i reached the conclusion that i was really ready and needing to go on to other things and the team on the project had a really strong desire to see it through to competition the team shrank in size pretty dramatically then i put a little more money into it in order to enable this transition to happen in 2008 part of which was they were going to ship 1 0
3943287 you asked if chandler has lived up to the dream i had six years ago and i think the fair answer to that is in part yes and in part no what has actually been delivered delivers on part of what the original dream was theres a cross platform fully open source innovative personal information manager with a very strong calendar those were among the original goals obviously its taken dramatically longer than i thought it would which i would attribute to not good judgment about how long it would take or the complexity of the project
3943288 its more of a conventional open source project in the sense that its momentum hereon is going to depend on the extent there is a community of volunteers who find it valuable enough to contribute to it and move it forward
3943289 the short answer is i dont know but there are promising signs the numbers of people involved while modest are non trivial and growing if you view it from the point of view as something that would replace outlook and exchange it has completely and utterly failed but from the point of view of having built something that tens of thousands of people are happily using and were using before there was a 1 0 by those metrics its pretty promising
3943290 well yeah actually its easy when youve been successful to lose calibration about what you can accomplish about how hard it can be about how long it will take theres lots of people on the second time around that have dug themselves into one or another kind of hole part of what allowed chandler to get traction and to get to 1 0 was when people on the project myself included where able to have more modest objectives to have more realistic planning and to get into a more agile cycle of development on the principle it is far better to deliver something than it is to have huge dreams and deliver nothing that would be my advice
3943291 how can they convict me if they dont have any evidence

3943399 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
3943400 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle

3943446 a nightmare is much more intense than a bad dream it can arouse feelings of fear horror and distress it replicates our deepest fears and can reflect the different types of stresses we face in our waking world
3943447 nightmarish thoughts such as losing your job being homeless falling and being chased are a manifestation of how much the credit crunch is affecting our daily lives and causing distressed sleep patterns
3943448 for example dreaming about being chased or falling is a reaction to the stresses we face in life the attacker or falling in the dream represents the emotion of fear and anxiety

3943481 we should expect to see chinese automakers exporting to north america soon as well as european manufacturers bringing their small cars here to manufacture and sell here as well as export back home to take advantage of the weak dollar

3943492 it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands

3943494 we cannot repeat the cycle of the white era we must build for 2011

3943535 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3943536 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3943537 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3943538 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3943539 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3943554 unlike past immigrant groups mexicans and other latinos have not assimilated into mainstream u s culture forming instead their own political and linguistic enclaves from los angeles to miami and rejecting the anglo protestant values that built the american dream the united states ignores this challenge at its peril
3943555 every self respecting postmodern leftist intellectual has as violent a reaction as joseph goebbels had to culture to reach for a gun hurling accusations of proto fascist eurocentrist cultural imperialism

3943559 an official document of 1607 prepared for the use of the lords of the realm set out the problem of change in one powerful phrase the poor man shall be satisfied in his end habitation and the gentleman not hindered in his desires improvement this formula appears to take for granted the essence of purely economic progress which is to achieve improvement at the price of social dislocation but it also hints at the tragic necessity by which the poor man clings to his hovel doomed by the rich mans desire for a public improvement which profits him privately polanyi 1944 37

3943601 the real surprise for me was the way liverpool played the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal this game was far more difficult than we expected and jose reina was the man of the match

3943690 a review of evans closing remarks as well as his conduct throughout the trial demonstrates improper behavior which is not acceptable in this commonwealth
3943691 as evidenced by the record such conduct included racial pandering misstatements of the law circumvention of the rulings of the court attempts to unfairly portray the defendants actions as racially motivated improper attempts to personalize the case and other unprofessional conduct
3943692 i will be much more careful about making sure that i dont even go near the line im im im listen i i ive got the scar here

3943697 and i feel duty bound to advise the court that those are the facts and circumstances that i observed and i think the record ought to so reflect
3943698 they had four major and respected law firms advising them as well as lazard
3943699 and all of them all of them were advising the board that there was zero value in a bankruptcy for shareholders as well as losses to creditors
3943700 and had they not been in a position where jpmorgan was in effect in control they could have said to jpmorgan we like that first agreement we know the price is inadequate but we expect that someone is going to come along another bank and there were other banks out there that given sufficient time could have come in and acquired them for closer to fair value
3943701 t his court is bound by the case law of this state
3943702 cannot apply the standards of the federal courts unless and until the new york rule is changed to make sealing more widely available either through legislative action or through judicial review of the current standards
3943703 many users of the state court system feel that a party seeking to seal commercial information faces an undue burden
3943704 obtain an appropriate order from the court pursuant to section 216 1 a of the uniform rules for the new york state trial courts finding good cause to seal the court records in which the confidential matter appears
3943705 owned or controlled spanish language television stations in puerto rico
3943706 publics interest in access to these court proceedings is substantial
3943707 first department rejects wholesale sealing of motion papers even when both sides to the litigation request sealing
3943708 is required to make its own inquiry to determine whether sealing is warranted
3943709 with respect to each specific document which it seeks to have sealed
3943710 the confidentiality designations are based in large part on their efforts to protect the interests of third parties unrelated to this litigation
3943711 many litigants have referred to the standard applied in the federal courts which appear to allow sealing more freely than in the new york courts
3943712 make sealing more widely available either through legislative action or through judicial review of the current standards
3943713 even assuming arguendo that the claim had been accepted defendants clearly reserved all rights under the policy in the first letter
3943714 their three subsequent letters dispel any possible inducement or justifiable reliance
3943715 cordisco bradway committed negligent misrepresentation and would have been liable regardless of any conduct by defendants
3943716 it was interesting that plaintiffs conceded there wasnt a coverage dispute in this matter
3943717 for the court to judicially create this apportionment where none had been before really caught the attention of a lot of people
3943718 we saw this as more than a slippery slope this was a runaway train
3943719 that requires us to fill a gap in our statutes
3943720 has enacted a new rule of law based on the novel and undefined term concurrently developing disease process in contravention of the workers compensation act
3943721 i think what the court has done is refresh everyone on what the rules are in adding on a nonoccupational permanent partial disability
3943722 the employer is responsible for the effects of a compensable injury even if that injurys toll on a particular plaintiff is unexpectedly severe because of the way it collaborates with other health problems
3943723 employers should not have to bear the costs of their employees smoking habits
3943724 i think the court appreciated the difference between taking someone as you find them and taking someone as they become this is a case where a pre existing condition was not found
3943725 the nexus between such misconduct and plaintiffs civil and or constitutional rights
3943726 have framed the relevant inquiry as a balancing test that weighs the plaintiffs need for anonymity against countervailing interests in full disclosure
3943727 a party may preserve his or her anonymity in judicial proceedings in special circumstances when the partys need for anonymity outweighs 1 prejudice to the opposing party and 2 the publics interest in knowing the partys identity
3943728 and did not balance plaintiffs interest in proceeding anonymously against the interests of defendants and the public
3943729 in light of the nature of plaintiffs claims including physical and sexual assault the district court should have afforded plaintiff wider latitude in pressing her claims
3943730 likewise it was error for the district court to issue specific instructions mandating the content and format of the putative amended complaint
3943731 how do i escape the impression that the government is welshing on this agreement
3943732 well i always like to do things that are not contemplated by the government
3943733 i dont mind climbing out on a limb but i need you to provide me with a limb to climb out on
3943734 while teen use of illegal drugs has gone down in recent years the one category that has gone up is teen abuse of prescription drugs
3943735 americans are in denial about how widespread this problem is
3943736 we know from our research that parental engagement being involved in your kids lives monitoring what theyre up to is a very key component in teen substance risk
3943737 we know how to change behavior and attitudes that is what we do
3943738 we know what messages will work and what will not
3943739 people know outside is going to feel much better for them but underpredict how happy theyre going to feel after being outside in nature even 15 minutes
3943740 the people inside overestimate their happiness about being inside its this error in judgment people have about how happy they are in a different environment that may explain why people dont spend more time in nature
3943741 rather than changing their ways to protect the environment the results of this study suggest that these people may give up on their efforts to protect the environment
3943742 i think most people recognize we face a severe environmental crisis but its hard to deal with that head on because most people feel helpless to do anything about it
3943743 if we look at the nature of the problem it is so big its hard to know what any individual can do in their own life to make a difference
3943744 the tendency when people are confronted with an overwhelming problem is to run away from it so psychologists are very experienced in dealing with that
3943745 one of the first things you think of is turning off lights when you leave a room or changing the thermostat settings in the house they dont think first of caulking windows or upgrading your furnace
3943746 more insulation in the attic and tight windows make more difference than changing the thermostat setting having a more fuel efficient car makes more difference than any amount youre likely to decrease driving
3943747 people showed strong approval for other students who recycled you would hope to see people disapprove of people who dont recycle but they didnt disapprove
3943748 we are recognizing that environmental problems have a tremendous impact on many aspects of our lives but we need a lot more work
3943749 we cant afford to let this increased environmental concern become just another fashionable trend
3943750 that we are building muscle and getting stronger for our sport that we like to play
3943751 gives me something fun to do at night and gets me in great shape
3943752 i like you lift weights and exercise to get strong
3943753 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3943754 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3943755 if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional urban developments of unmentionable awfulness
3943756 show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war
3943757 numbers racket why the economy is worse than we know
3943758 i think i lost it when i applied for my passport because i cant find the other documents i sent with them either
3943759 we are also concerned about this not full stadium issue
3943760 for competitions like beach volleyball and basketball spectators have one ticket for the whole afternoon morning evening
3943761 they may choose to go to one of them but not all them
3943762 if they find that there are not enough people or if they find that there are too many empty seats they organise some cheerleaders
3943763 board on the nest so i lurked on there for ideas and it seemed like such a nice board so i stayed and started posting ive been there since
3943764 girls i dont care if your butts may be in danger by playing chess in nalchik suck it up were all going to have a good time pretending nothing absolutely nothing is wrong
3943765 the signals and the pathways are strengthening as each action gets repeated
3943766 a sudden and drastic reduction in the availability of credit
3943767 a situation in which the provision of services such as medical treatment or education rather than being uniform everywhere varies in quality according to where people live
3943768 a small scale environmentally friendly settlement designed for sustainable living
3943769 a wife or girlfriend of a professional sportsman esp one of group accompanying a travelling team
3943770 the temporary failure of an item of clothing to do its job in covering a part of the body that it would be advisable to keep covered
3943771 these new words reflect the way our lives are changing
3943772 explores how islam is influencing and adapting the modern world
3943773 the subjects these and other extreme metal bands deal with death without meaning the futility of violence the corruption of power correspond well to the issues confronting hundreds of millions of young muslims today the majority of whom live under authoritarian governments in societies torn by inequality underdevelopment and various types of violent conflict
3943774 contraception is not abortion the bush administrations proposal to change the definition of abortion and reduce womens access to birth control must be stopped

3943777 its just the opposite of what its not if that makes any sentence
3943778 we thought that the earth was the centre of the world
3943779 when its my time of the month i ask myself why
3943780 its because life as we know it is a function of the world in which its in
3943781 im fed up because ive had a row or failed an exam or lost my job
3943782 you can depend on me because im in this for keeps
3943783 was leaving her mangy mutt of a dog at her house
3943784 seat belt on the passenger side was not working so legally she could not transport the dog
3943785 what should you have said or wished you had said today
3943786 the folks that weve arrested today were using these kinds of weapons to shoot up cars and weapons and shoot at people and intimidate people in the drug world
3943787 why are 10 clients reporting this issue and we never saw it in our own lab
3943788 we have discovered an undefended georgian army depot containing a significant amount of military hardware and weapons near the town of gori the military hardware is in full working order and combat ready
3943789 any claims that russian troops are advancing inside georgia are untrue
3943790 if georgian president mikheil saakashvilis absurd demand that the peacekeeping operation be halted in abkhazia is implemented the region will risk being plunged deeper into crisis by the unhealthy ambitions of the incumbent georgian authorities
3943791 considering this we think it impossible to resolve the fate of the peacekeeping operation without taking into account the opinion of the abkhazian side
3943792 a nd its very difficult to find someone who can speak for the whole country
3943793 the operation was halted not because president george bush had made a request but because the goals set by the russian president had been attained
3943794 this role cannot be doubted it has been and will be played scrupulously
3943795 he seems to be still worrying that the principles coordinated with the french president contain nothing of the kind instead russias role as a peacekeeper is affirmed there
3943796 on the whole the world has the correct perception of what is going on
3943797 ambassadors working in moscow mostly provide their countries with unbiased reports about the developments
3943798 mr putin responded by leveling a blow at americas caucasus darling
3943799 quid pro quo in the caucasus or where we are is a new era in international relations
3943800 obviously the conflict between georgia and russia has affected the whole geopolitical structure
3943801 and many analysts and many observers many investors have wondered what is going to happen to the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline and to the baku tbilisi erzurum gas pipeline and to the european and american plans to enhance the role of the southern caucasus region for conveying strategic hydrocarbons toward the west
3943802 the alternative export route which is to take by rail or older pipelines oil from azerbaijan across to georgian ports that route has now been blocked by the destruction of those ports and blocking of those ports by russia
3943803 oil can be to a certain extent rerouted gas in terms of expanding gas production youd really have to have a dedicated energy transit route and were thinking about nabucco which is of course europes plan for bringing additional gas from turkmenistan into europe
3943804 it would pass through basically the same route as the bte pipeline
3943805 due to the recent blast on the pipeline in turkey 20 000 tons of oil were lost and then there were the alleged attacks on the pipeline in georgia
3943806 all these prove that the risks are still there and they have increased after the latest conflict this prompts the three countries on the pipeline route to reconsider the security system and take new measures greater security also serves the interests of companies and governments
3943807 if things move in positive directions politically if things seem more stable it may be that some of these things like shipping oil through the georgian ports or expanding the btc pipeline do become possible again so its a bit speculative at this point
3943808 we all sat on the floor there was one wounded person with us and we were asked to pick up another person with injuries along the way before that we spent four days in a cellar with no gas or electricity all the cables had been ripped out and were lying on the ground
3943809 the situation is truly catastrophic here there are several hundred refugees in this village efforts are made to somehow transfer them to vladikavkaz but huge traffic jams block the roads
3943810 people are trying to leave in cars and new wounded people keep pouring into the village an aid post has been set up outside surgery takes place in the open air
3943811 yesterday at dusk villages located northwest and northeast from gori toward the direction of tskhinvali became a looting scene for various groupings and formations
3943812 people were calling governmental agencies the media asking for help the looters took everything money groceries cattle chicken everything
3943813 it was not completely finished yet but every i spent every single penny i had collected to built this house now i am homeless i dont know whats going to happen and what the government will do for poor people i hope they will think about us
3943814 i heard shots from jet fighters flying over our village my mom is in georgia she stayed with my dad i asked her to come but she said she was staying because my dad is in the war hes fighting
3943815 we are deep in the realm of disinformation which comes from both sides of the conflict and of propaganda from the media
3943816 the figures they give for the dead the injured about the civilian population and the displaced people are absolutely groundless
3943817 our teams have been trying since friday august 8 to get to south ossetia from tbilisi but its been very difficult to get there for security reasons
3943818 so we dont have any firsthand information yet on what the actual humanitarian situation is on the ground but from what were hearing it sounds very very serious and we are very much worried for the population
3943819 we came to fight because a northern neighbor wants to suppress a small country we want to tell it no
3943820 this country thinks that old times will come back but those times are over everyone knows that ukraine then poland could be next
3943821 if they put under question democracy and independence in georgia then they can undermine democracy and independence in other states
3943822 always be united and we latvians lithuanians estonians poles and ukrainians will always be with you
3943823 nato we should realize nato has no military mandate in the south caucasus
3943824 so if youre saying nato cant resolve this question militarily then youre right we cant and that is not natos ambition and thats not in natos mandate
3943825 as i speak the russian tanks are attacking the town of gori and are rampaging through the town
3943826 this is not a text that will change the face of the world the face of the world has been changed by texts which have changed nothing for 14 years in that part of the world there have been the resolutions and decisions of the osce the united nations and then there was the war now we are trying to get involved in georgia in a very intense fashion this is the role of the eus french presidency this is the role of the entire eu to involve europe to involve the eu in the practical resolution of the conflict
3943827 unilateral accusations i think the eu must ask itself which role it wants to play in the future
3943828 we have to decide on either a strong statement with a unilateral accusation or if we look to the future we should take a real role in order to further the stabilization that also means keeping open all channels to moscow and tbilisi and i am confident we will take a decision in that sense
3943829 you need first people to observe that the cease fire is maintained
3943830 then you have to have observers monitors as you know that do the role that you know very well they have to do eventually they have to do something else and that will require as bernard kouchner has said a un security council resolution that will define the modalities and all that
3943831 today when the occupier is on our soil they think that tbilisi will be broken subdued and will surrender to their tanks as it had happened several times in the past in other european countries
3943832 it will not happen now and you are standing here with us and supporting us
3943833 i also understand the disappointment that many of our citizens feel at the lack of tangible support from the west that includes military support i know that many georgians expected the west would intervene
3943834 i think we should take this into consideration from now on any policy decision we make must be carefully thought through with a cool head only then will we be able to really achieve the georgian governments goals
3943835 we should never raise the expectations of the georgian people or our own expectations too high by thinking that the west is going to intervene militarily to resolve this conflict
3943836 i dont have a particularly good opinion about some high ranking individuals in the government and i doubt they really had envisaged things that were to come it seems like saakashvili at that moment was under others influence unfortunately
3943837 we in fact responded to south ossetia leader eduard kokoitys provocation whether kokoity was driven by stupidity or deviousness the fact remains that they attacked our positions and we responded
3943838 we were not able to contain ourselves and began the attack on tskhinvali which was a mistake of course
3943839 he had to put a non use of force pledge on the table
3943840 right up until the hours before georgia launched its attack late last week in south ossetia washingtons top envoy for the region assistant secretary of state daniel fried and other administration officials were warning the georgians not to allow the conflict to escalate
3943841 he calls for immediate follow through in implementing the agreed principles including the full end to hostilities and the withdrawal of forces to previous positions
3943842 the secretary general reiterates his support for a solution based on the full respect of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia he is prepared to use his good offices toward the restoration of peace and security in the region
3943843 to provide full and safe access for humanitarian organizations to the regions affected by the conflicts
3943844 the number of people in need of food assistance continues to escalate
3943845 point no 1 is an immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities i e a cease fire
3943846 point no 2 is access for the provisions of humanitarian relief point no 3 is the commitment not to use forces and to refrain from inflammatory rhetoric point no 4 is the withdrawal of all armed personnel to positions prevailing before the start of the current hostilities
3943847 there are details that need to be clarified specifically with regard to the role of the international community in seeking to resolve the conflict
3943848 if there are little pockets of opposition and other aggressive manifestations we will make a decision to liquidate them
3943849 although there should be a temporary arrangement for now later it should be replaced by an international process with the participation of the eu and the un
3943850 what we have clearly obtained at this stage is a cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of the occupying forces we have a temporary arrangement with the russian peacekeepers fine but then there should be internationalization of the process and we have the commitment of all sides
3943851 of course this is a political document but general principles are there we need legal details we need a security council resolution and we need more international observers on the ground and more internationalization of the entire process
3943852 and while sovereignty is based on the will of the people and the constitution territorial integrity as a rule represents the real state of affairs
3943853 can the ossetians and the abkhaz and do they want to be a part of georgia
3943854 this question should be put to them and they will give their own unambiguous answer it is not russia or any other country that should answer this question this should be done in strict compliance with international law although in recent years international law too has abounded with examples of self determination of peoples and the emergence of new states on the map lets recall the example of kosovo so it is a question that needs to be answered by the ossetians and the abkhaz taking into consideration history and what has happened in recent days
3943855 the question of the future status of abkhazia and south ossetia reflects a clear understanding that the status quo is untenable
3943856 georgia will never now get south ossetia and abkhazia back
3943857 we had one where we had to dig into someone and pull a tooth out
3943858 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
3943859 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected russia has stated that changing the government of georgia is not its goal the united states and the world expect russia to honor that commitment
3943860 underscore the strong support of the united states for the georgian people and their democratically elected government
3943861 of course we understand and they write about it openly that the current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states worries about the fate of this project but obviously one day they will have to choose between the notion of prestige with respect to this virtual project and a real partnership on issues that indeed require collective actions
3943862 georgia is a democratic government in the caucuses that has elected its leaders
3943863 to call it a project of anybody perhaps belies more about the way russia thinks about its neighbors than the way it thinks about u s policy
3943864 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3943865 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and agreed to a provisional cease fire
3943866 unfortunately were receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements were concerned about reports that russian units have taken up positions on the east side of the city of gori which allows them to block the east west highway divide the country and threaten the capital of tbilisi
3943867 no cease fires are in action now so what is the trust we can put in the russian side
3943868 they still bomb gori they still loot the whole villages in and around the conflict zone where the georgians are living we have credible information en masse that men are taken from the houses and they are executed
3943869 european monitors have to be on the ground europe has to get engaged physically on the ground and europe has to stop the attacks from happening
3943870 we are part of europe and part of europe is being attacked now in a very aggressive manner by armed forces with large scale military operations from the russian side this cannot be happening in the modern world
3943871 the georgian authorities have given orders that led to genocide war crimes and ethnic cleansing this must be answered
3943872 as i have already said hundreds of our citizens who suffered in south ossetia are preparing complaints that will be filed in international courts and the russian state will actively support this so that justice is done
3943873 what we are seeing in the areas is classical balkan type and world war ii type ethnic cleansing and purification campaigns
3943874 and the world seems to talk about peace talks cease fires agreements modalities while the worst kinds of atrocities are being committed right now in my country against my people of all ethnic groups
3943875 the cease fire on the georgian side was always enforced but as you saw the russian side the russian occupational force didnt respect any cease fire
3943876 they came into and as i said they went through our towns they are rampaging and they are also shooting
3943877 south ossetians supported by russians of committing horrible massacres in georgian villages
3943878 we of course trust in international justice and are confident that our cause is strong
3943879 this is why we filed the lawsuit we are asking the international court of justice as the judicial organ of the united nations to recognize and protect the rights of georgia as its member
3943880 heyyy heyyyy baaaabyyyy i want to know oh oh if youll be my girllllll
3943881 hey i didnt find any kurdish forces that were surrounding the iraqi security forces up here

3943884 for scholars of race barack obama presents a new american dilemma on the one hand his election as president would be a breathtaking symbol of racial progress on the other an obama victory could prove illusory doing little to dismantle racism while crippling their ability to call attention to it
3943885 i think it was an attempt to scare the protestors but its okay now the foreign minister was very kind and welcomed me to his country

3943925 there was also what i would call a marsupial ground sloth that weighed several hundred kilograms at least and perhaps in excess of 1 000 pounds 500 kilogram
3943926 and then a thing that you might want to call a marsupial hippopotamus or a marsupial tapir which would have weighed about 1 000 pounds 500 kilograms

3943954 fee revenue growth was strong up 20 per cent on the prior year underpinned by package fee income and strong volume growth
3943955 we now have a higher proportion of borrowers on loan packages who get a discount on the standard variable rate

3943968 ive heard all hosts of recent olympic games failed to clinch the first gold so why should you be the exception
3943969 dont cry my hero no athlete has kept the title in consecutive games you have many opportunities in the future
3943970 we need to develop the confidence rationality openness and tolerance appropriate to citizens of a fast growing emerging nation
3943971 being a good host is both more meaningful and gratifying than merely notching up gold medals
3943972 what is important is to show china and to show beijing to the whole world
3943973 several months ago everyone was talking about tibet but foreigners need to know the truth about china and we believe that through the olympic games the world will know the truth
3943974 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3943975 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3943976 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3943977 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3943978 what is important is to show china and to show beijing to the whole world
3943979 several months ago everyone was talking about tibet but foreigners need to know the truth about china and we believe that through the olympic games the world will know the truth
3943980 to be the most decorated olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3943981 when my friends at school heard the news of me going to the olympics they thought i was playing a joke on them
3943982 it was the heavens the earth and the people all working in my favor
3943983 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3943984 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3943985 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3943986 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3943987 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3943988 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3943989 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3943990 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3943991 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3943992 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3943993 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3943994 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3943995 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3943996 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3943997 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3943998 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3943999 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3944000 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3944001 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3944002 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

3944020 and further by these my son be admonished of making of many blogs there is no end and of much reading of blogs is a weariness of the flesh
3944021 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3944022 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3944023 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3944024 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3944025 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3944026 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3944027 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3944028 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3944029 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3944030 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3944031 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3944032 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3944033 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3944034 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3944035 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3944036 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3944037 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3944038 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3944039 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3944040 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3944041 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3944042 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3944043 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3944044 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3944045 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3944046 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3944047 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3944048 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3944049 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3944050 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3944051 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3944052 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3944053 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3944054 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3944055 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3944056 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3944057 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3944058 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3944059 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3944060 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3944061 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3944062 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3944063 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3944064 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3944065 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3944066 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3944067 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3944068 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3944069 putting aside how those undecided voters feel about issues or anything else just that fact alone would suggest that at this point it would probably break toward mccain
3944070 i have seen the question posed on this series of clips on youtube
3944071 a true liberal democrat who would bring her reckless agenda to washington
3944072 congressman heller has failed our veterans and repeatedly voted against measures that lower our gas prices
3944073 chomsky is one of the thinkers and writers that helped me wake up from the nightmare of the reality
3944074 the fact is ladies and gentlemen of south dakota senators need to be able to get out on the floor and debate
3944075 if i were to get too strong or to get personal which i wouldnt do anyway i think there would be a backlash
3944076 i present myself and allow the voters to draw their own conclusions
3944077 my illness has given me a unique view on life
3944078 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3944079 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3944080 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3944081 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3944082 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3944083 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3944084 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3944085 who are open to doing something on the production side
3944086 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3944087 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3944088 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3944089 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3944090 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3944091 in another recent conversation i was challenged on my assertion that the whole
3944092 every eye shall see him 1 thessalonians 4 16 says that his coming will be heralded with
3944093 tribulation was associated with the fall of jerusalem in a
3944094 all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth
3944095 a person should not be elected because of his faith nor should he be rejected because of his faith let me assure you that no authorities of my church or of any other church for that matter will ever
3944096 you can no more have a christian nation than you can have a christian bicycle
3944097 each religion has its own unique doctrines and history these are not bases for criticism but rather a test of our tolerance religious tolerance would be a shallow principle indeed if it were reserved only for faiths with which we agree
3944098 there are some who would have a presidential candidate describe and explain his churchs distinctive doctrines to do so would enable the very religious test the founders prohibited in the constitution
3944099 when i place my hand on the bible and take the oath of office that oath becomes my highest promise to god if i am fortunate to become your president i will serve no one religion no one group no one cause and no one interest a president must serve only the common cause of the people of the united states
3944100 a president must serve only the common cause of the people of the united states
3944101 we separate church and state affairs in this country and for good reason no religion should dictate to the state nor should the state interfere with the free practice of religion but in recent years the notion of the separation of church and state has been taken by some well beyond its original meaning they seek to remove from the public domain any acknowledgment of god religion is seen as merely a private affair with no place in public life it is as if they are intent on establishing a new religion in america the religion of secularism they are wrong
3944102 when i place my hand on the bible and take the oath of office that oath becomes my highest promise to god if i am fortunate to become your president i will serve no one religion no one group no one cause and no one interest a president must serve only the common cause of the people of the united states
3944103 ahhh yes the mormons they are quite a colorful cult
3944104 is it not possible he was simply trying to assert that the leaders of his church would not dictate his presidential decisions that does leave some scope for allowing his personal faith assuming he really has one to influence his decisions i would be interested in knowing your reaction if he had indicated that his mormon elders would take a guiding role in his presidency
3944105 the end times doctrine or eschatology of many mormons holds the belief that in the
3944106 sleeper awake rise from the dead and christ will shine on you
3944107 i think its safe to say that a real disciple of christ is not very well suited to the compromises of governing anything larger than a small community clan tribe or village
3944108 the end times doctrine or eschatology of many mormons holds the belief that in the
3944109 i question why he would bother putting his hand on the bible make an oath or promise anything to god at all
3944110 a president must serve only the common cause of the people of the united states
3944111 some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them
3944112 this may seem an extraordinary claim but it merely enunciates an ordinary fact about the world in which we live certain beliefs place their adherents beyond the reach of every peaceful means of persuasion while inspiring them to commit acts of extraordinary violence against others there is in fact no talking to some people if they cannot be captured and they often cannot otherwise tolerant people may be justified in killing them in self defense this is what the united states attempted in afghanistan and it is what we and other western powers are bound to attempt at an even greater cost to ourselves and to innocents abroad elsewhere in the muslim world we will continue to spill blood in what is at bottom a war of ideas
3944113 some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them
3944114 as also some of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring
3944115 i have become all things to all men that i might by all means save some
3944116 screw the caribou and polar bears lets start drilling now
3944117 the calving grounds are on lands in alaska but it is our children who will be affected by what happens there
3944118 if the oil companies go into the calving grounds it would be like drilling in a hospital nursery thats how we feel about it we will do everything that we can everything in our power to prevent that because it means our life
3944119 our right to continue to live our traditions and to depend on the caribou like we do is our constitutional right as americans it is our inherent right as indigenous people and our essential human right to our own means of subsistence
3944120 what gives scott starr the right to judge others why is it un christian to have a belief that is opposite of yours
3944121 including the people that live near these areas that do not seem to be a part of public debate or consciousness on this topic at all i believe that by any standard of spirituality or ethics this is wrong especially if one wears the name christian
3944122 will give to each person according to what he has done
3944123 all men are like grass and all their glory is like the flowers of the field the grass withers and the flowers fall 25 but the word of the lord stands forever
3944124 it does not reflect our obligations to protect the environment and human health nor is it economically prudent
3944125 drilling in the anwr only delays the day when we must reduce our use of oil and it would unnecessarily harm a unique ecosystem and already threatened species
3944126 oil and coal companies do not need assistance from u
3944127 every eye shall see him 1 thessalonians 4 16 says that his coming will be heralded with
3944128 tribulation was associated with the fall of jerusalem in a
3944129 all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth
3944130 i dont mean to be rude but i think its a mean insult when you say something dumb like morality can be replicated in a test tube
3944131 but i have a hard time imagining that morality can be replicated in a laboratory or a test tube
3944132 also for the sake of clarity what would you define morality as what are the boundaries of it and what are the absolutes
3944133 the god gene how faith is hardwired into our genes
3944134 the god gene how faith is hardwired into our genes
3944135 i cant understand how it makes sense therefore its junk
3944136 i cant understand how it makes sense therefore its junk
3944137 the other side choses to allow themselves to believe the industry of science and that this branch of humanity is incapable of error or deceit
3944138 is incapable of error or deceit but only with respect to the existence of an engineer for the cosmos
3944139 the other side choses to allow themselves to believe the industry of science and that this branch of humanity is incapable of error or deceit
3944140 is incapable of error or deceit but only with respect to the existence of an engineer for the cosmos
3944141 however from an atheist perspective these errors can never be so great as to jeopardize the underlying belief of a non intelligent creative force
3944142 conditional acceptance not belief theres a difference i guess as i mentioned earlier science doesnt allow belief
3944143 however from an atheist perspective these errors can never be so great as to jeopardize the underlying belief of a non intelligent creative force
3944144 conditional acceptance not belief theres a difference i guess as i mentioned earlier science doesnt allow belief what is the difference can a presumptive belief in a hypothesis have any relation to acceptance of the result following scientific tests well if results dont conform to your hypothesis and one insists on accepting the hypothesis after repeating the results then my buddy youve got yourself a real belief a presumptive belief is conditional acceptance if one is skeptical of it and only accepts if the results consistently conform to the hypothesis and even then it remains conditional as future uncovering of more facts can change the interpretation and render the hypothesis false if this really was passionate committed belief then wed be having scientists crying their eyes out after every single experiment they perform d also can a presumptive belief affect the nature of the scientific testing it definitely can but any modification has to be noted cause if one purposely manipulates the results to fit with their beliefs to the point that it does not honestly become the conclusion as described per the treatments then one would definitely get into trouble since as noted earlier everythign is either repeated built upon or used for application i dont understand how science prohibits belief there are no mechanisms in science that can can provide this control sorry i didnt mean belief in a higher intelligence i meant with respect to hypotheses and testing i e conditional acceptance thanks for the discussions hey thank you too its sure a nice change from the usual stuff i get on youtube my youtube id is ccwman21 mine is richardaj230 2 13 pm scott starr said doh i am getting left behind in this conversation i pretty much am in agreement with the general thesis of d s martin on this i need to re read the thread before i insert comments i had meant to respond to the junk dna comment by richard my first thoughts were
3944145 the christian is quite free to believe that there is a considerable amount of settled order and inevitable development in the universe but the materialist is not allowed to admit into his spotless machine the slightest speck of spiritualism or miracle
3944146 when you believe it thats when youll see it or comprehend it
3944147 religious worldview contains nothing valid in fact i would submit that such a belief is as arrogant as it is unfounded and absurd
3944148 even a blind squirrel can find a nut now and then
3944149 the universe does not meet the definition of a closed thermodynamic system and therefore entropy could not be applied to the universe
3944150 i could but i wont cite one example of a specific error in scientific knowledge which remains and is generally believed and taught
3944151 whats with all the junk dna why are genes arbitrarily separated by thousands upon thousands of base pairs why could this code potentially recombine during gametogenesis to create zygotes that are destined to have cancer when they grow up and why is it that parts of this code have to become useless to become useful pretty paradoxical like when different combinations of working genes and mutated useless genes coding for different color pigments produce the different eye colors skin colors etc because as i said many parts of this supposed code are useless if any engineer could create such a twistable malleable changeable and in many cases lethally or neutral for the organism causes it to waste so much space by having useless parts of it and i mean the rest of the dna sequences that are not known or at least not yet to be copies of other useful ones around etc hed be fired pretty quickly
3944152 its like trying to read and understand a very complicated chinese novel
3944153 the take home message is oh my gosh this is really complicated
3944154 we are increasingly being forced to pay attention to our non gene dna sequences
3944155 i think of them as gate crashers at a party
3944156 they appeared by chance over evolutionary time neither to the organisms benefit nor to its hindrance that is quite an interesting shift in perspective for many biologists
3944157 defining the functional elements helps us zoom in to look for differences in sequence that might relate to disease
3944158 one of the most extraordinary discoveries of the twentieth century
3944159 was that dna actually stores information the detailed instructions for assembling proteins in the form of a four character digital code
3944160 there would still be enough room left for all the information in every book ever written
3944161 have exactly the same relevant properties as a computer code or language
3944162 dna is like a software program only much more complex than anything weve ever devised
3944163 the gene is a package of information not an object the pattern of base pairs in a dna molecule specifies the gene but the dna molecule is the medium its not the message
3944164 the data at the core of life is not disorganized its not simply orderly like salt crystals but its complex and specific information that can accomplish a bewildering task the building of biological machines that far outstrip human technological capabilities
3944165 an honest man armed with all the knowledge available to us now could only state that in some sense the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle so many are the conditions which would have had to have been satisfied to get it going
3944166 a reasonable person weighing the purely scientific evidence on the issue would likely have come down on the side of skepticism regarding a creator that is no longer the case
3944167 today the concrete data point strongly in the direction of the god hypothesis it is the simplest and most obvious solution
3944168 artificial languages and their decoding systems memory banks for information storage and retrieval elegant control systems regulating the automated assembly of parts and components error fail safe and proof reading devices utilized for quality control assembly processes involving the principle of prefabrication and modular construction and a capacity not equalled in any of our most advanced machines for it would be capable of replicating its entire structure within a matter of a few hours
3944169 the six feet of dna coiled inside every one of our bodys one hundred trillion cells contains a four letter chemical alphabet that spells out precise assembly instructions for all the proteins from which our bodies are made no hypothesis has come close to explaining how information got into biological matter by naturalistic means
3944170 the basic flaw of all evolutionary views is the origin of the information in living beings
3944171 the coding system used for living beings is optimal from an engineering standpoint this fact strengthens the argument that it was a case of purposeful design rather that a lucky chance
3944172 that the basis of life would be exceedingly simple that expectation has been smashed vision motion and other biological functions have proven to be no less sophisticated than television cameras and automobiles science has made enormous progress in understanding how the chemistry of life works but the elegance and complexity of biological systems at the molecular level have paralyzed sciences attempt to explain their origins
3944173 evolutionists are still trying to apply darwins nineteenth century thinking to a twenty first century reality and its not working i think the information revolution taking place in biology is sounding the death knell for darwinism and chemical evolutionary theories
3944174 i believe that the testimony of science supports theism while there will always be points of tension or unresolved conflict the major developments in science in the past five decades have been running in a strongly theistic direction
3944175 this new realm of molecular genetics is where we see the most compelling evidence of design on the earth
3944176 what i think the dna material has done is show that intelligence must have been involved in getting these extraordinary diverse elements together
3944177 for you formed my inward parts you covered me in my mothers womb i will praise you for i am fearfully and wonderfully made my frame was not hidden from you when i was made in secret and skillfully wrought
3944178 ultimately the darwinian theory of evolution is no more nor less than the great cosmogenic myth of the twentieth century
3944179 every history of the twentieth century lists three thinkers as preeminent in influence darwin marx and freud all three were regarded as scientific and hence far more reliable than anything religious in their heyday
3944180 yet marx and freud have fallen and even their dwindling bands of followers no longer claim that their insights were based on any methodology remotely comparable to that of experimental science i am convinced that darwin is next on the block his fall will be by far the mightiest of the three
3944181 give the appearance of having been designed for a purpose
3944182 dna is like a computer program but far far more advanced than any software weve ever created
3944183 not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good
3944184 servant an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer
3944185 one that avenges wrongs when a nation or state has to be punished for refusing to make amends for the wrongs inflicted by its subjects or to restore what it has seized unjustly
3944186 belligerents should have a rightful intention so that they intend the advancement of good or the avoidance of evil
3944187 true religion looks upon as peaceful those wars that are waged not for motives of aggrandizement or cruelty but with the object of securing peace of punishing evil doers and of uplifting the good
3944188 all christians agree that we are to live at peace with the state as long as the state allows us to live by our religious convictions for hundreds of years however there have been at least three interpretations of how we are to do this 1 some christians believe that the state is so corrupt that christians should have as little to do with it as possible although they should be good citizens as long as they can do so without compromising their beliefs they should not work for the government vote in elections or serve in the military 2 others believe that god has given the state authority in certain areas and the church authority in others christians can be loyal to both and can work for either they should not however confuse the two in this view church and state are concerned with two totally different spheres the spiritual and the physical and thus complement each other but do not work together 3 still others believe that christians have a responsibility to make the state better they can do this politically by electing christian or other high principled leaders they can also do this morally by serving as an influence for good in society in this view church and state ideally work together for the good of all none of these views advocate rebelling against or refusing to obey the governments laws or regulations unless those laws clearly require you to violate the moral standards revealed by god wherever we find ourselves we must be responsible citizens as well as responsible christians
3944189 for a religion to serve as the basis of a culture it must seek to preserve peace but also be willing to use force all major religions tend toward this mean
3944190 a central purpose of americas political arrangements is the subordination of religion to the political order meaning the primacy of democracy
3944191 tame and domesticate the religious passions of the sort that convulsed europe how might such a goal be accomplished by refusing to establish religion of course an instead establishing a commercial republic a capitalism they aimed to submerge peoples turbulent energies in self interested pursuit of material comforts
3944192 we have seen the roots of islamic violence in the life and teachings of mohammed we have seen that world events have conspired to place islam and christianity in a conflict of civilizations that has stretched from the sixth to the twenty first century
3944193 liberal america hating blasphemy and pie in the sky touchy feely lovey dovey denial of realities
3944194 do not give dogs what is sacred do not throw your pearls to pigs if you do they may trample them under their feet and then turn and tear you to pieces
3944195 whoever would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from deceitful speech 11 he must turn from evil and do good he must seek peace and pursue it 12 for the eyes of the lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer but the face of the lord is against those who do evil
3944196 do not fear what they fear b do not be frightened
3944197 the principles of a just war originated with classical greek and roman philosophers like plato and cicero proposed by s
3944198 god demands that governments provide protection and justice for its citizens from evil doers
3944199 you clearly are denying that governments can legitimately provide justice and protection to their citizens
3944200 to my amazement the newspapers of the following morning reported that the government had decided to ignore the potsdam declaration
3944201 the first atomic bomb was dropped on hiroshima a military base that was because we wished in the first instance to avoid in so far as possible the killing of civilians
3944202 said declaration does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of his majesty as sovereign ruler
3944203 was it the atomic bomb or russian participation in the war that was responsible for the surrender
3944204 the atomic bomb merely hastened a process already reaching an inevitable conclusion
3944205 the source of the large numbers used after the war by truman stimson and churchill to justify the use of the atomic bomb has yet to be discovered
3944206 if anyone strikes you on the right cheek turn the other also
3944207 if he struck him with the back of his hand he must pay him 400 zuz
3944208 try again your first blow failed to achieve its intended effect i deny you the power to humiliate me i am a human being just like you your status does not alter that fact you cannot demean me
3944209 they are strangers in the world as i am in other words
3944210 love your neighbor and hate your enemy matt 5 43 nkjv see also lev

3944212 go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation whoever believes and is baptized will be saved but whoever does not believe should be shot dead dead dead
3944213 why dont you love me jenny im not a smart man but i know what love is
3944214 therefore this is by no means a proof that god wants his church to take part in killing our fellow humans on the contrary killing our fellow humans is insult to the great commission
3944215 go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation whoever believes and is baptized will be saved but whoever does not believe should be shot dead dead dead
3944216 my house shall be a house of prayer for all nations goy
3944217 i recently did an internet search and happened upon a theology blog called
3944218 i prefer to stay with the new testament the apostles and with the actual history of the church
3944219 this blog is dedicated to exploring christianity and religion in a reasonable and courteous way i like to exchange ideas and insights while avoiding the name calling i hope to set an atmosphere of gentleness and respect
3944220 i remind you that there were hundreds and hundreds of soldiers who were held up as model christians soldiers and martyrs in the ancient and early church well before constantine christian pacifists conveniently ignore all of these men as if they never existed
3944221 held up as model christians by who canonized by who but other men
3944222 even if a world free of strife utopia is not possible shouldnt we be trying to get as close as possible
3944223 operation iraqi freedom and shock and awe bandwagon at the start and ask hard questions and put all the carnage in perspective
3944224 if all were to do the same as you there would be nothing to prevent the emperor being left in utter solitude and desertion and the affairs of the earth would fall into the hands of the wildest and most lawless barbarians and then there would no longer remain among men any of the glory of your religion or of the true wisdom
3944225 and some peopled just as soon kill you as look at you
3944226 roots in sin that is common to all the players in the conflict at least as far back as the constantine when
3944227 the constantinian viewing of the world through the unscriptural and ill advised blending of church and empire
3944228 thomisticguy feel free to keep quoting people like thomas aquinas and referring to other
3944229 faith because becoming a christian would naturally mean that he was jeopardizing his livelihood forfeiting his standing and reputation and possibly even putting his life at risk he stood to lose everythingbecause of his choice to follow jesus
3944230 also i consider you my brother in christ and i think it would be wise for you to re consider your viewpoint especially if you are teaching others the same
3944231 wish to call yourself a christian you cannot do so realistically and also be someone who primarily espouses the values of the world
3944232 relic of the dark ages or of the superstitious past
3944233 i think it can be established that god utilizes governments to establish justice and they have been established and modeled after a plan that he authored however just as with all human endeavor that model and plan is often abandoned by humankind through freewill and the source of all strife and warfare is sin
3944234 authority except that which god has established the authorities that exist have been established by god
3944235 is gods servant to do you good but if you do wrong be afraid for he does not bear the sword for nothing he is gods servant an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer
3944236 wish to call yourself a christian you cannot do so realistically and also be someone who primarily espouses the values of the world
3944237 if you wish to call yourself a christian you cannot do so realistically and also be someone who primarily espouses the values of the world you cannot serve two masters you can respect civil authority and abide by the laws of the land so long as they do not contradict gods laws
3944238 in fact you seem to be more interested in wrath and justice than love and forgiveness and holiness
3944239 by two or three witnesses let all things be confirmed
3944240 because of this rarity i believe christians should be very careful about their participation in warfare on behalf of nation states and certainly not be bandwagon people without marked scrutiny and discernment i will offer the present elective war in iraq as a prime example of a situation where america has made all the wrong moves all the way back to the enabling of saddam back in the reagan administration days i know you have not made any allusions to the war in iraq necessarily but i am curious to ask for anyone to explainif this is gods will that we are fighting in iraq why is it going so poorly for us
3944241 if one wishes to call yourself a christian you cannot do so realistically and also be someone who primarily espouses the values of the world you cannot serve two masters you can respect civil authority and abide by the laws of the land so long as they do not contradict gods laws
3944242 my thoughts are that when one assumes that a nation state has god on its side without a very christ like discernment which is just about impossible in the world of propaganda and politics it would seem that they are putting their faith in an expression of the world as much as anything
3944243 can we always assume that because a government decides that country x is
3944244 do you think its evil to be a communist in an of itself
3944245 are we to assume that one nation has the god given right and authority to dub another nation evil
3944246 i have laid down some pretty strong indictments of the
3944247 what if my country the u s decides to take make war against american indians based upon capatilist ideology as was done in the past
3944248 further lets say that i am an american indian and a christian whose side would i be on as a good christian citizen of both communities
3944249 if one side achieves a military victory is that how we decide whose side god was on
3944250 i agree that we are not quite ready to discuss iraq yet without some of these preliminary issues cleared up but what if things never improve there and we lose there what lesson can we take from that do we just declare victory and go home
3944251 what do you make of these verses and how would you define world
3944252 western civilization is by its very history and nature a product of judeo christian culture
3944253 this is an odd question most native american reservations are sovereign territory and have their own police governing authorities and laws the native americans in our area are fabulously wealthy do to the gaming casinos that they own they have their own sovereign reservations and jet set all over the world one tribe just purchased the major baseball stadium in our city
3944254 power domination and extermination of evildoers will stop the spiral prevent the violence from feeding on itself extinguish resentment allow us to dominate benevolently
3944255 and you know what i would say about violence being inherently evil being a logical fallacy but i will leave that alone
3944256 let every soul be subject to the governing authorities for there is no authority except from god and the authorities that exist are appointed by god
3944257 render unto caesar the things that are caesars and unto god the things that are gods
3944258 righteous father though the world does not know you i know you and they know that you have sent me
3944259 my kingdom is not of this world if it were my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the jews but now my kingdom is from another place
3944260 romans 13 serves as a warning against the state exceeding its limits
3944261 the creation was subjected to frustration but the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage
3944262 the whole world is under the control of the evil one
3944263 and just to highlight my basic point about systems and morals
3944264 the system of morals i am referring to of course is the divine law given by god himself
3944265 john himself in 1 john 2 defines what he means by the world as that which gives rise to the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life
3944266 the lust of the flesh the lust of eyes and the pride of life
3944267 again when i refer to trans cultural i am simply saying the definition of the word
3944268 still retains a primal imagination in which a higher being is interwoven into his life and existence
3944269 and i see that the two definitions youve offered from scripture of
3944270 there are actually no evil things per se only the misuse of good things gnostics believe that there are evil things again it is my judgment that the christian pacifist position borders on gnostic dualism
3944271 do you think its evil to be a communist in and of itself
3944272 gnostics espouse a radical irreconcilable dualism composed of immateriality seen as divine and wholly good and of matter considered wholly evil for gnostics the predicament is that pieces or sparks of immateriality have fallen into matter human souls are trapped in bodies in tripartite rather than dualistic varieties of gnosticism the immaterial spirit lies trapped in the soul as well as the body because the spark is not merely trapped but hidden liberation requires the revelation of ones divinity salvation for the individual means the extrication of the spark from the body and its return to its immaterial home salvation for the cosmos means the return of all sparks the aim is to terminate any connection between immateriality and matter
3944273 communism is obviously an evil system of government it is responsible for the systematic death of over 100 000 000 people within their own countries in the 20th century communist countries carried out the most horrendous persecutions of christians in church history just a side note the scholarly total for deaths due to the spanish inquisition over a 200 year period now stands at 2 500 communism not only carries out massive destruction of human life it also destroys economies and puts people into poverty however a communist is not an evil person per se on the other hand stalin and pol pot were two of the most vicious dictators in human history
3944274 western civilization is by its very history and nature a product of judeo christian culture
3944275 what i am not getting is how gnostic dualism is being extrapolated from pacifism and or a discussion of government or even the biblical definition of
3944276 if god institutes and ordains governments and no leader assumes power without the endorsement of god then how can the communist form of government be evil unto itself
3944277 the aspect of gods wrath in biblical theology cannot be denied
3944278 my understanding of the romans 13 the role of government and the definition of
3944279 my problem is not with classic christian pacifism in general
3944280 it is atheistic and does not recognize that men have inalienable rights that are endowed by ones creator
3944281 because my system is orthodox christianity and jesus said i am the way the truth and the life
3944282 there is only one idea of how christians are to act as individuals in relationship to their enemies they are to love them
3944283 but im not here saying that system is the same as world only that systems belong to the word in a way and are related to it in that both are in a sense human artifices in a way that earth or
3944284 and if you are a christian then why are you concerned with
3944285 also again im not here making any implications on your character only on your system
3944286 that there is only one idea regarding the institution of government in scripture is simply not true
3944287 without having to go into a lengthy apology for western civilization which is beyond the scope of this post please allow me to note a few things in its defense
3944288 where is the alleged power of judeo christian particularly christian thought to transform hearts and minds positively aid in the formation of culture and ethics and spiritually liberate and elevate mankind
3944289 25 anyone who loves his life loses it but anyone who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal whoever has no love for no concern for no regard for his life here on earth but despises it preserves his life forever and ever
3944290 in a sense what western civilization has done is what christianity has done
3944291 where is the alleged power of judeo christian particularly christian thought to transform hearts and minds positively aid in the formation of culture and ethics and spiritually liberate and elevate mankind
3944292 the power of god unto salvation first to the jew and then the gentile
3944293 but in indigenous culture the spiritual freedom quality and attained wisdom of a life is of far more importance than the quantity of life as expressed in things like life expectancy i would submit that christian values are supposed to be of that same priority indigenous culture is generally more interested in harmony balance and the aquisition of maturity than euro western culture
3944294 i do not believe that it is wrong for christians to participate in government or the protection of citizenry
3944295 in a sense what western civilization has done is what christianity has done
3944296 western civilization is by its very history and nature a product of judeo christian culture i e their laws art literature language and culture have all been formed and molded by christianity
3944297 in a sense what western civilization has done is what christianity has done
3944298 intrinsic to your position is a devaluation of gods divine monarchy that was even a greater denigration than that stated by the ancient israelites to samuel
3944299 any evils that can be associated with christianity are actually a result from mans sinfulness and the churchs failure to live up to the christian imperative
3944300 please note that those who consider a commitment to non violence as living up to a christian imperative do not deserve disrespect or ridicule
3944301 we have backed israel unfailingly even when they have also been outside of gods plan for mankind

3944307 we are in a rut and cant get out of it ive met victims whove lost loved ones over 30 35 years and theyre still the same
3944308 i was brought up to believe democracy and justice was the road to go if somebody offended or hurt you where is the rule of justice
3944309 you have nobody been put in jail for the murder of 31 innocent people one of the 29 victims was pregnant with twins call it political murder but murder is murder no matter what way you look at it
3944310 it was premeditated murder they plotted and created a situation where innocent people were going to lose their lives
3944311 the system doesnt work for victims of terrorism nobody wants to catch these people and any in jail on the good friday agreement have been let out on the whim of getting terrorists into government
3944312 oh you thought i was serious about taking you to the dance im sorry
3944313 i wasnt so happy about him going because he was only eight
3944314 i watched him until he went out of sight over the hill
3944315 four local boys and one of the spanish students five of them going down the road and that was it the last i saw him alive
3944316 i just knew they were there to tell me something about the trip i just knew
3944317 he was up at the leisure centre and said every now and again people were called to come up that there was a list of missing people and gradually it was getting smaller as people were getting found but there was still no word about oran and sean
3944318 mickey just said dont worry ill bring the wee man home ill find him
3944319 at 7am i saw people hugging each other at the mcloughlins house
3944320 someone came up and said wee seans dead at that exact minute the phone rang it was mickey he said have you heard the news i said yes wee seans dead and he said yes and orans dead too
3944321 he been down to the shop with his mum and hed just popped in
3944322 and the last memory i have of alan is him coming and putting two packets of sweets on the hall table
3944323 he was lovely like that im just so proud of him
3944324 i just thought thats not my brother what have they done to him
3944325 it wasnt until i went to the inquest i realised how much damage theyd done
3944326 but even in the coffin you couldnt stop the flow of blood from his chest they had to put plasters on him because of a gash through his eye and across his face
3944327 my brother alan was just a boy just a boy and they just cut him down in his prime

3944334 as a council we have tried to do our best to mark the anniversary the wording issue as far as we are concerned is resolved the support group wanted certain wording at the garden and that has been included
3944335 im horrified that the pps has decided against any prosecution in this case and demand to know why
3944336 why in this day and age of dna testing and other specialist forensic techniques does the pps believe there is not enough evidence to bring any charges against people who murdered an innocent child
3944337 i would also like to know why if witnesses felt scared to testify in open court they were not offered protection
3944338 we have put our faith in the justice system but it has failed us to date one man has been charged in relation to the attack on thomas and his friends but this is a very light charge we expressed no confidence in the pps in the early stages of the investigation and nothing has changed our opinion the police have worked hard on the investigation and we know they are also unhappy with the pps direction

3944347 i saw a girl under the remains of a burning car i think it was a front axle the girl was trapped and was conscious she was screaming

3944402 the government has 100 control in wardak and the taleban are in a very poor condition in this province they do not have the support of the people
3944403 some of the incidents that took place on the highways are because we did not have enough afghan national police and there is misinformation against us
3944404 now the karzai government is building roads and bringing development unfortunately they cannot bring security
3944405 in my view this government is better than the taleban as there was no education economy or development
3944406 now the economy is good and children and going to school even girls the taleban were brutal and took power by force not democracy

3944559 i dont suffer from mental instability i enjoy every minute of it
3944560 in the next five to ten years i see more consolidation in every region of the world
3944561 we should expect to see chinese automakers exporting to north america soon as well as european manufacturers bringing their small cars here to manufacture and sell here as well as export back home to take advantage of the weak dollar
3944562 the rest of the regions its going to be more about working with other companies on say platforms or specific deals on buying products
3944563 were not going to be putting any name plate on it until we can be rest assured it meets all of our standards
3944564 that has been the biggest delay in that product program it did not meet our standards

3944572 we are talking about combat troops maybe in 2010 11 there could be drawdowns

3944574 you want to go over a waterfall in a barrel mom i dont think thats a very good idea
3944575 i block that out of my mind i dont worry about that
3944576 hes just an incredible athlete and i wish him the best
3944577 we actually hung out a little bit this offseason at some different events
3944578 were fine we talk like normal people we dont worry about the comparisons
3944579 hes going to be great in this league all the best to him
3944580 i know im far from it i know theres a lot of hard work focus determination and patience involved you have to go out there and continue to work your way through it
3944581 i dont because when i look back on it there were a lot of things that were left on the field that could have been better and that could have helped me out and could have helped the team out
3944582 i used to get to the top of my last step and sit and bounce now im sliding moving around keeping my feet live
3944583 im trying to keep my foundation keep my feet right when im throwing the ball downfield keeping my feet more active
3944584 his rookie year he relied a lot on his athletic ability and that a lot of teams didnt know what to expect of him
3944585 last year i think the defenses caught up with him playing spy techniques with linebackers and protecting the perimeters to keep him from rolling out i think he had to become a better student of the game and with heimderdinger he has
3944586 ive got to believe the same thing is going to happen
3944587 one thing that i thought stood out was that his feet were never underneath him when he threw and i think you need to have your feet underneath you in any sport you play so thats what we worked on to make him more accurate and he has become more accurate
3944588 hes such a good athlete that sometimes you say just go make a play and dont worry about it but in this league you have to be able to slide and find a window
3944589 i try to let the game come to me not take the game into my own hands
3944590 i know his first year he didnt scramble to throw the ball he was scrambling to run
3944591 now hes looking to see if he can find a receiver open hes showing a lot more accuracy hes hitting receivers in the numbers and thats what a quarterback should do

3944670 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3944671 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3944672 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3944673 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3944674 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3944675 it provides an important set of capabilities and will accelerate our product applications enabling us to offer a broader portfolio of solutions to our customers and to enhance shareholder value
3944676 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
3944677 weve seen this in the past before in motorolas razr line it was a very big seller but the first version of that phone had rf radio frequency problems they had to recall it fix it and put it back out there
3944678 it could end up drawing more power because now the phone thinks its getting a worse signal than it actually is when it goes to talk to the network it speaks louder than it needs to
3944679 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3944781 perusahaan publik harus hati hati dalam mengeluarkan pernyataan yang bersifat forward looking statement
3944782 the epas decision to deny this waiver proves that the ethanol industry plays a vital role in relieving our nations independence on foreign oil and it should be viewed as nothing but positive for our economy
3944783 with diesel prices up 40 since february the cost to process package and transport food is the primary culprit of increased prices also investment speculators in the commodities markets are driving up grain prices beyond the increases generated by global supply and demand issues
3944784 numerous studies have shown consumers would be paying up to 15 percent more if ethanol were not part of the fuel equation
3944785 a matter of scheduling and timing and is an amicable decision i wish the musuem all the best with their upcoming exhibitions

3944797 its frustrating because we go so slow teachers are distracted by students who are not really trying to do anything they get more attention than the people who are trying to learn
3944798 its frustrating when you know that other schools are doing more and learning more

3944801 el derecho a la salud debe tener ruedas para que vaya y venga donde se requiera tenemos que ampliar la cobertura en servicios de salud y estoy de acuerdo en que debe haber transparencia y rendici n de cuentas
3944802 aqu lo importante y coincido con el diputado mayans no es si un enfermo pertence al imss al issste o cualquier otra instituci n de salud p blica aqu lo que tenemos que ver es darles y proporcionarles los servicios de salud porque muchas veces no se trata de a que sistema pertenezco sino que se trata de que tan cerca me queda el hospital o centro de salud y ah es donde tenemos que trabajar para impulsar este sistema nico de salud
3944803 i think that russia is right first of all we did not start this war the world respects america because its strong we should be strong too if we want to gain respect thats why i think my government is right
3944804 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
3944805 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
3944806 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
3944807 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
3944808 the u s food and drug administration and other health organizations around the world have concluded that msg is safe
3944809 these low cost amplifying devices can look tempting to individuals with hearing impairment because of the significant cost differences
3944810 but our research found that the low cost aids generally dont meet the fitting requirements to help a hearing impaired person and could potentially damage a persons hearing
3944811 aside from being of extremely poor quality very low cost hearing aids those under 100 have the potential to damage your hearing because they send very loud sounds into the ear the studys mid range hearing aids 100 500 were of higher quality and were not considered a safety hazard
3944812 based on the research the best advice for consumers is to talk to an audiologist because hearing aids have complex technical features they need to be fitted and customized to the individual
3944813 currently more than 32 million people have a hearing impairment yet only about 25 percent of those use hearing aids
3944814 meanwhile the aging population is growing and hearing loss becomes more common as we become older
3944815 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference
3944816 because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings
3944817 if you move your hand backward as you catch the egg and increase the time of contact over which the impact occurs the impact will be less forceful and the egg will not break it is the same phenomenon experienced in catching a baseball
3944818 our studies with carbon nanotubes have been ongoing for quite some time
3944819 each step along the way has led to the next breakthrough and each time weve learned more about how they grow and what their applications could be we believe that carbon nanotubes have tremendous potential for the lives of each one of us
3944820 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
3944821 he has a goon squad to muscle people with ak 47s
3944822 hit suffers from especially poor and corrupt leadership at the top which has been a significant impediment to our efforts

3944824 without doubt as iraq emerges from the ashes of the past it will very soon be able to compete for summer games
3944825 the iraqi people and government are extremely proud of you you have our blessings and best wishes for success in your competition
3944826 let the whole world know that iraq is back as a functioning democracy and member of the international community
3944827 the iraqi government is very pleased that the olympic committee agreed to allow our athletes compete with their challengers from the rest of the world
3944828 this new democratic iraqi government will give top priority and support to competitive sports without any bias or favouritism
3944829 in the new iraq all capable athletes will be given a chance and supported in their competitions in iraq the region and the world
3944830 keep your eyes open and you will see a rebirth of iraqi sports with a much more robust team in 2012
3944831 this years team endured sacrifice and difficulties the 2012 team will have much more time and support to develop their skills and be in the running for medals in all their sports
3944832 i think in the long run probably the death penalty is going to disappear in asia as it seems to be doing in many parts of the rest of the world
3944833 the frame that regards the death penalty as a human rights issue has become more conspicuous and salient in asia than it was in the past
3944834 and when you frame the death penalty as a human rights issue instead of a crime issue you invite anxiety and concern and resistance to the death penalty because after all its a state killing
3944835 the most dramatic execution decreases occurred in the rapidly developing democracies of south korea and taiwan but declines have also occurred in nations such as india and malaysia
3944836 when development and plural democracy take root in asia the decline of the death penalty usually comes sooner rather than later
3944837 you dont have to have anything important to say you just have to look good saying it
3944838 aku bisa ungkapin banyak hal jadi fans bisa tahu tentang aku yang sebenarnya
3944839 its a very awkward circumstance i dont have ambition to seek public life or public position i truly am enjoying teaching so ive made a decision as a citizen and as a citizen

3944842 unbalanced lift that causes the helicopter to tip and move laterally
3944843 its a nice trade for everybody the criminals get a little protection the russian government gets to have something happen without having their fingerprints on it thats the assumption
3944844 like estonia we dont have links to the russian government but its not a fluke where we magically have this happen when a shooting war starts
3944845 this looks to me like more than just some grassroots hacktivist inspired attacks
3944846 but at the same time theres no way to link it to a state sponsored type of attack its somewhere in the middle it certainly has criminal elements
3944847 this was really targeted at preventing georgia from presenting its message to the world through its communications platform and the web
3944848 obviously the georgians can talk to reporters but as more and more communications move to the internet with distributed blogs and all that all the attacks that have happened were targeted at preventing georgia from quickly and easily presenting the facts or their spin on whats going on
3944849 anywhere you have organized crime they leap in to take advantage of the news of the day
3944850 if theres an armed conflict between two nations and there are criminals in both nations they would leap to take advantage of that dont you think
3944851 customers are wanting new features and functionality to support their growing business requirements they cant or else they might move to say oracle or ibm microsoft with sql server 2008 is back on track with a 36 month release cycle which is essential not only to retain customers but to attract new customers and compete against other players
3944852 top features can now be added in sub releases without affecting the overall major release
3944853 after the massive delays sql server 2005 had microsoft and especially ted kummert corporate vice president of microsofts data and storage platform division were pretty vocal that it wouldnt happen again kummert had said that future releases would ship on a 24 to 36 month cycle and end of summer is basically the outside limit of that window im pretty sure he didnt want to be made a liar in the first major release on his watch
3944854 an interesting question that well learn the answer to over the next few months is whether microsoft compromised quality to get the product out the door
3944855 the sql server team has traditionally been willing to take as long as they needed to make sure releases were solid at this point i dont think there is any particular reason to think microsoft cut corners but they definitely changed the development and test process and that always carries risks
3944856 interesting features for developers and administrators and some things that could help sql server continue its march up market
3944857 in line with what customers are wanting support for stronger security higher performance integration availability and manageability
3944858 the new policy based management is critical especially when dealing with thousands of sql server instances it provides better control and improves the dbas productivity also as enterprises scale their database the need to optimise performance is critical sql server 2008 delivers intelligent troubleshooting capabilities
3944859 una cosa es que tengamos derechos dijo y otra es que se cumplan y esta sentencia ayudar a velar por los derechos de los trabajadores tanto en el plano laboral como en el personal como ha sido mi caso porque yo laboralmente no ten a problemas
3944860 es evidente que una empresa propiedad de la conferencia episcopal no es demasiado proclive ni al ascenso de las mujeres ni al reconocimiento de los derechos que tengan que ver con el mundo homosexual eso no cabe discutirlo

3944888 well just work some vaseline into those callouses the casting medium sticks to dry skin
3944889 your feet have the exact same bone structure as my wifes do she even has the little callouses
3944890 lets hope we never have another name on that wall
3944891 our mantra is to promote a students success enabling students to achieve whatever personal or professional goals they have
3944892 at the top of juniatas best traits are the unique amazing people you meet although i have been a student only at juniata the fascinating and highly motivated people i have encountered and come to know and love at this school are exactly the reason why going to college just anywhere doesnt count since becoming a juniata student i have seen the sun set from the tucson mountains in arizona learned wisdom from monks and cloistered nuns in boston and have traveled to seville spain and morocco from my experience juniata stands as the place where the best come together
3944893 we believe it is important to challenge students students grow and learn when they are asked to do more than they are used to doing and perhaps occasionally asked to do more than they believe they are capable of doing at the same time students need support we encourage students to take some risks it is easier to take a few risks when you feel that it wont be the end of the world if you fail we offer students a great mix of challenge and support
3944894 the best reason for a prospective student to choose kansas state would be the people here i feel like i am part of a family were at a big school but we get that small town feel
3944895 we are a big 12 school we have nationally ranked academic programs and a philosophy of putting students first
3944896 a lot of people say the best reason to come to k is our study abroad program but i believe thats only part of it my favorite thing about k is how much effort everyone puts in to building an education that is right for you specifically and not students in general its the personal attention thats why i love it here
3944897 the problem of human trafficking is rampant in eastern and central regions where many children are taken to the border and smuggled easily into neighbouring kenya for forced labour and prostitution
3944898 uganda has no specific law on human trafficking though culprits may be charged under offenses on morality like rape indecent assault
3944899 uganda is a source transit and destination country for men women and children trafficked for forced labour and sex
3944900 sexual exploitation is one big reason for child trafficking in uganda
3944901 most immigration officers are not skilled enough to understand or even detect how child trafficking rings operate
3944902 there is a local joke that it is difficult to pass illegal drugs through ugandan immigration but easy to pass humans
3944903 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3944904 were working with groups like ebay and craigslist to prevent any fraudulent activity
3944905 wanted 4 tix to obama speech top dollar paid 1000
3944906 i was willing to do anything to get a ticket no matter what
3944907 i mean certainly you dont want a situation where the highest bidder gets to participate in the process
3944908 wed be willing to bet that the vast majority of tickets obtained from scalpers would be snapped up by obama supporters anyway
3944909 youd think the campaign might embrace those folks not harass them
3944910 we want to make sure that each and every person thats in invesco field that night deserves to be there
3944911 and made sure they do have a plan for how theyre going to get here
3944912 im sure that in 1 or 2 percent there might have been information given out that wasnt quite as clear as it needed to be
3944913 i came back last year and played 28 games and scored 10 goals i made an impact and ill do the same again this year whether it means ill play less games or more well see
3944914 the first thing gary did when he came in was have a meeting with me he wanted to see if i was okay and was everything fine and it was
3944915 there were no problems between me and sammy lee other than our opinions
3944916 it was just the confidence that gary brought that helped me i think he gave confidence to the whole squad
3944917 you always say its a test of character when you go through tough times
3944918 when you look over the 38 games i think i had a half decent season i was delighted with how it ended
3944919 johan is more of a link up man than nic
3944920 he is good in the air and has a good eye for goal in and out of the box
3944921 we are not putting pressure on him to come in and take over from nic we are putting pressure on him to go out there and do what he does best
3944922 i think we will get a lot of benefit from johan this season and he will score quite a few goals for us
3944923 if we start how we ended last season we wont have any problems
3944924 we have the same team plus one or two good additions and we are looking forward to the season getting up and running
3944925 to put the world in order we must first put the nation in order to put the nation in order we must put the family in order to put the family in order we must cultivate our personal life and to cultivate our personal life we must first set our hearts right

3944929 ago is doing very well it was just a little niggle so he should pull up fine
3944930 he has come through a reasonably tough pre season and with the opening game of the season on sunday he could definitely play a part
3944931 its fantastic for ago to be part of the group again and we look forward to him having a solid game on sunday
3944932 understanding the setbacks that hes had it will be beneficial to paul and the club that he gets through the game without any problems
3944933 increased international trade a robust economy and a strong real are the biggest drivers for the growing business aviation market in brazil
3944934 we have three to four years worth of production on our order books
3944935 there was a minor bug in one of my companys applications
3944936 for whatever reason it just hung after the are you sure prompt
3944937 in an attempt to try and track down the problem i popped my head into our userinput class to ensure that the code was correctly validating the input thats when i came across this
3944938 its crucial that i spend the coming season without any injury its most important that i show all i can on the pitch
3944939 many chances will come along during the coming year whats important is how i grab those chances
3944940 um what is a minister supposed to do if the ceiling collapses
3944941 oh no what will they think when their minister arrives missing teeth
3944942 please tell me there is more surely there is more there has to be more than this
3944943 im not going the kids are annoying the teachers hate me give me three reasons i should go
3944944 first the kids are not that annoying second the teachers dont hate you and third you are the principal and it is your job to go
3944945 reverend ive been coming to church every sunday for over sixty years and to tell you the truth i cant remember more than two or three of the sermons ive heard in all these years tell me why should i bother to come
3944946 ive eaten meals for my entire life i cant remember more than two or three menus but i still continue to eat
3944947 can help us move into greater involvement and presence outside our church boundaries someone who take us out of ourselves and into the community we need to get the message out
3944948 yet stupid obstacles keep us from perusing who we actually are attracted to
3944949 many people ventured to snoqulamie middle school on saturday february 9th we were all there for the same reasons it was time to caucus there were twenty six of us in the north bend 05 5585 precinct all different all unique considering this is a reading journal and i dont have anything to write about this week as i am focusing on the midterm i will tell you about some of them there was a computer lab technician a lady who worked at fall city elementary she was on the fence about candidates not really sure which way to go this was her first caucus in years she was a gentle seeming woman who cared about education and teachers considering she was basically one herself there was lady with amazing glasses they were thick rimmed colorful and down right gorgeous she was a hillary fan she was jokingly threatening her husband who was undecided to vote for hillary there was an older man concerned about economics he was for hillary clinton too he thought she would fix the economy he was trained in how to caucus and ended up being our clinton delegate a young girl with her mother contributed her own thoughts to our obama clinton debate despite only being thirteen and not allowed to vote she was still active and into things one of my punk looking neighbors a street down attended as well he was for obama he actually looked quite fine in his vintage coat i suppose the caucus was an important enough reason for him not to be smoking pot twenty six people six for hillary clinton twenty for barrack obama we were all different but all there for the same reason to help elect a candidate who is actually competent enough to be president
3944950 we were not surprised by the fine performance of the liege side we had seen enough of them to know they were a good aggressive side
3944951 the real surprise for me was the way liverpool played the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
3944952 we will have to be a lot better in the second leg at anfield much better
3944953 we have been playing well in pre season looking confident and passing the ball well
3944954 but we did not do any of those things i did not want to bring
3944955 we waited until well into the second half before using him but we were not controlling the game and i had to bring him on
3944956 this game was far more difficult than we expected and jose reina was the man of the match
3944957 we know we can always rely on pepe to stop penalties but we have been told that the other effort may have been behind the line but these things happen
3944958 liverpool maybe came here asleep and not expecting this sort of game
3944959 maybe though we have woken them up for the second leg which will me much harder for us
3944960 we felt that if we did not lose this first leg we would still be in with a chance
3944961 yeah hes you know ryan just he goes a little bit crazy on tour sometimes
3944962 renewed worries about credit markets and economies aretaking a toll on investor sentiment and buying appetite remainsweak
3944963 also more volatility is expected towards afternoon tradingas options expiry is due today
3944964 you have to make the best out of what you have
3944965 the people who see me who watch me fight they tell me they like what they see but i just have to fight my fight and i have to stick with the plan
3944966 when you dont have that one knockout punch you have to mentally prepare yourself that you cant afford to make one mistake in those 12 rounds
3944967 some guys can cover up a mistake because they can hurt you bad with one shot but i cant do that guys arent worried about me hurting them i just have to keep my focus 100 percent the whole night

3945162 i hope twente win tonight and also hope steve mcclarens a success in holland
3945163 most people sniggered when he took the job but i say hats of to him maybe it would be an idea if other mediocre english managers could head abroad for a time and find out how football should actually be played and coached hes learning something new and showing its not all about the money for him
3945164 did you get to choose which of the games you did a mbm on tonight and if so why did you choose us rather than the scousers
3945165 i honestly cant figure out why twente would want mcclaren
3945166 by now several of the dutch footballing class of 1988 are still available and the players from the wc 1998 team that reached the semi finals de boers bergkamp etc are becoming available why not take the risk with one of them in his book football against the enemy simon kuper quotes stan valckx as saying the only thing he learnt from bobby robson was english do the twente players need to learn english i thought all the dutch learnt it from kindergarten onwards now
3945167 i cant help but wonder if bendtner will take the hint
3945168 nine injuries and hes still on the bench perhaps he should see if he can secure a move to hull before the transfer window closes
3945169 the home fans are chanting steve mcclarens name and in english too which is impressive
3945170 is that tall fellow from togo playing or is he aggressively moving his money around in preparation of his impending retirement
3945171 i recall him at boro and the last world cup

3945173 could wilkshire perhaps rile eboue to the point where he quits football and takes up a new hobby
3945174 i just want to say that i am mildly enjoying your commentary
3945175 he will now wait until twente go 3 0 down before throwing on seven strikers and winning 4 3
3945176 i just want to say that as gooner i petrified with fear ahead of the new season arsene is almost pointedly trying not to ensure success on the pitch
3945177 i had hoped that your slagging of walcott and adebayor back in the 72nd minute would encourage them to link up and score a goal and it worked
3945178 what we need is stuff installed and what we need is people to make sure its going to work and what we need is for the umpires to understand the protocol

3945180 during these meetings our volunteers presented open source applications answered questions and cleared up doubts they often also helped in installing the software on the pcs in school computer labs and on school servers
3945181 we combined our visit to the city with the free software day which attracted local open source developers and we even managed to interest university teachers and several local police officers
3945182 some school staff told us they are still considering a switch others would use the summer vacation to for instance install openoffice and a few schools said they would switch to open source when they renew their computer labs

3945389 so if we ever come in contact with an et race we could well be interacting with a post biological entity a sentient machine of mind boggling complexity or something even beyond that looking far far into the future could post biological entities have no form but exist only as pure forms of energy
3945390 the maintenance improvement and perpetuation of knowledge and intelligence is the central driving force of cultural evolution and that to the extent intelligence can be improved it will be improved applying this principle to life in the universe extraterrestrials will have sought the best way to improve their intelligence and may have long ago advanced beyond flesh and blood to artificial intelligence constituting a post biological universe
3945391 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
3945392 its been a long long journey so long that a whole book was written about a part of it its obvious to anyone who is familiar with the story and the history that it is one of the project that to make an understatement did not turn out the way it was originally planned
3945393 if you view it from the point of view as something that would replace outlook and exchange it has completely and utterly failed
3945394 last january i reached the conclusion that i was really ready and needing to go on to other things and the team on the project had a really strong desire to see it through to competition the team shrank in size pretty dramatically then i put a little more money into it in order to enable this transition to happen in 2008 part of which was they were going to ship 1 0
3945395 you asked if chandler has lived up to the dream i had six years ago and i think the fair answer to that is in part yes and in part no what has actually been delivered delivers on part of what the original dream was theres a cross platform fully open source innovative personal information manager with a very strong calendar those were among the original goals obviously its taken dramatically longer than i thought it would which i would attribute to not good judgment about how long it would take or the complexity of the project
3945396 its more of a conventional open source project in the sense that its momentum hereon is going to depend on the extent there is a community of volunteers who find it valuable enough to contribute to it and move it forward
3945397 the short answer is i dont know but there are promising signs the numbers of people involved while modest are non trivial and growing if you view it from the point of view as something that would replace outlook and exchange it has completely and utterly failed but from the point of view of having built something that tens of thousands of people are happily using and were using before there was a 1 0 by those metrics its pretty promising
3945398 well yeah actually its easy when youve been successful to lose calibration about what you can accomplish about how hard it can be about how long it will take theres lots of people on the second time around that have dug themselves into one or another kind of hole part of what allowed chandler to get traction and to get to 1 0 was when people on the project myself included where able to have more modest objectives to have more realistic planning and to get into a more agile cycle of development on the principle it is far better to deliver something than it is to have huge dreams and deliver nothing that would be my advice
3945399 it was great to see baj have a chance to really show what hes capable of on some of these big european climbs
3945400 he was amazing on the big climbs through the pyrenees and our whole squad rode incredibly strong to support him
3945401 this was a great experience for us to come to europe and race so competitively
3945402 weve made it clear our program is built to race well domestically in the united states and compete increasingly on the international level its a natural team progression for us and the best way for our athletes to grow and develop it also gives us phenomenal momentum as we head into the uspro criterium uspro road race and the uspro time trial
3945403 it is certainly the most demanding american stage race and i expect it to be one of the most competitive
3945404 but i think it is the type of race that really suits team type 1
3945405 this may be the biggest mountain event hes done with the team this year but he is so on top of his diabetes management that im sure he is going to play a big part in our attack
3945406 with moises and glen both making their olympic team selection and in beijing we are going to be at a bit of a disadvantage
3945407 glen arrived early tuesday morning after a brutally long trip
3945408 moises really would have been a dangerous gc general classification rider here and we will certainly miss him but chadwick and valeriy kobzarenko are both very good on this terrain and they both time trial well
3945409 using a web camera or a cell phone video camera people record themselves doing anything watching a football game at a bar telling jokes buying new shoes playing with their child and can upload it immediately to the web where others who subscribe to their videos get the update
3945410 i think video as a medium is significantly more engaging than text

3945419 de eso hemos hablado y pr ximamente tendremos concreciones al respecto noticias que realmente creo que son buenas para la regi n y en especial para unasur
3945420 esto es el fruto del trabajo en consenso que se viene realizando con todas las provincias del pa s y tambi n es una muestra que estamos en buen camino para alcanzar la pr rroga de la ley
3945421 empresarios productores profesionales y funcionarios provinciales y nacionales se encolumnaron bajo un solo objetivo resignando incluso algunas posturas en pos de alcanzar la continuidad del sistema y alcanzar los objetivos propuestos incrementar la masa forestal de argentina
3945422 que supo entender la necesidad del sector de avanzar en el proyecto tambi n la insistencia de la provincia de misiones de modificar el articulo 4 por parte de la provincia de misiones y la comprensi n del resto de las provincias sobre esta necesidad que se presentaba en aquellas trabajan con especies nativas con esta modificaci n se podr forestar con especies nativas en lugares donde fueron desmontados
3945423 a n es materia pendiente conocer los reales beneficios sociales econ micos y ambientales de la actividad y su impacto en las econom as regionales
3945424 cuesta crear conciencia forestal y esta es una responsabilidad compartida misiones est cubierta de verde a diferencia de brasil y paraguay que pr cticamente perdieron lo que ten an de selva paranaense por la expansi n agr cola en la provincia a n queda un 35 del recurso natural y por otra parte cuenta con la mayor cantidad de hect reas de bosques cultivados en el pa s posicionando a la foresto industria como la principal actividad econ mica de la provincia
3945425 no se puede planificar el desarrollo forestal argentino si no existen f bricas de pasta celulosica stas forman parte de toda la cadena de producci n
3945426 se est violando la ley con tal de apoyar proyectos que son contaminantes no hay respeto hacia la gente
3945427 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
3945428 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
3945429 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
3945430 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
3945431 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
3945432 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
3945433 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades

3945453 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
3945454 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
3945455 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio
3945456 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
3945457 nosotros protegemos adoramos amamos e invocamos a la madre naturaleza y no permitiremos que sigan adelante con estos destrozos esto es un atropello del gobierno y esperamos que se presenten a darnos una explicaci n en el lugar afectado
3945458 lo que proponemos como alternativa es que la carretera pueda pasar por otra v a
3945459 nosotros no estamos en contra del camino porque es necesario pero queremos que se respeten los lugares sagrados
3945460 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
3945461 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
3945462 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3945463 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3945464 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3945465 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3945466 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3945467 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3945468 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3945469 bueno mira vamos a alambrar esto porque ac vamos a tener los animales a medias
3945470 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo

3945475 yang terpenting sekarang adalah bagaimana kita bisa melaksanakan semua janji
3945476 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3945477 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3945478 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3945479 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3945480 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3945481 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3945482 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3945483 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3945484 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3945485 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3945486 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3945487 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3945488 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3945489 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3945490 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3945491 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3945492 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3945493 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3945494 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3945495 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3945496 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3945497 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3945498 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3945499 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3945500 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3945501 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3945502 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3945503 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3945504 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3945505 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3945506 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3945507 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3945508 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3945509 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3945510 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3945511 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3945512 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3945513 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3945514 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3945515 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3945516 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3945517 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3945518 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3945519 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3945520 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3945521 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3945522 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3945523 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3945524 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3945525 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3945526 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3945527 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3945528 were surprised by the remarks of racism spain is not a racist country quite the opposite
3945529 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3945530 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3945531 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3945532 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3945533 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3945534 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3945535 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3945536 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3945537 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3945538 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3945539 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3945540 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3945541 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3945542 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3945543 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3945544 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3945545 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3945546 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3945547 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3945548 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3945549 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3945550 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3945551 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3945552 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3945553 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3945554 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
3945555 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
3945556 and we are aware that the u s is uptight about this project
3945557 but a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts
3945558 we are spending more and more time with our communications devices but spending less on them
3945559 we may not yet have felt the full impact of the economic downturn on consumer and advertiser spend
3945560 while television advertiser revenue has remained relatively steady in nominal terms future stability cannot be taken for granted
3945561 in the next five to ten years i see more consolidation in every region of the world
3945562 we should expect to see chinese automakers exporting to north america soon as well as european manufacturers bringing their small cars here to manufacture and sell here as well as export back home to take advantage of the weak dollar
3945563 the rest of the regions its going to be more about working with other companies on say platforms or specific deals on buying products
3945564 were not going to be putting any name plate on it until we can be rest assured it meets all of our standards
3945565 that has been the biggest delay in that product program it did not meet our standards
3945566 no one is going to buy a car company like this in the market that its in and expect okay why dont we see if we can go sell it now after one year
3945567 even though i wasnt born here this is the only country i have known all my life i grew up here
3945568 normally when people get hold of money for a shopping spree they go all out to satisfy their desire for anything they want be it food or other items like clothing
3945569 but when i was allowed to spend rm800 provided by nst to buy food items especially groceries i realised that food is expensive now
3945570 after about two weeks into the project i began to spend according to my familys needs
3945571 before the project my family would dine out more than twice a month sometimes we would even have lunch outside
3945572 but now with the increasing price of groceries we are opting for home cooked meals which are better prepared and nutritious
3945573 almost all the children in the streets are children of immigrants
3945574 thats probably why so many of them end up in the streets
3945575 both locals and officials are concerned about the uncontrolled entry of immigrants especially illegal immigrants
3945576 the abu sayyaf still pose a threat they are both terrorists and bandits and have staged kidnappings in sabah in the past
3945577 the challenge is to reduce the dependence on migrant workers
3945578 as long as were stuck in this low wage sector economy we will remain dependent on foreign labour you can reduce dependence on foreign labour by using less labour intensive technology to do that you have to invest more in human capital and technology
3945579 if we had an efficient information system we would have known who they are where they are or whether their status has changed
3945580 when you have an efficient monitoring system you would then be in a better position to estimate the number of illegal immigrants
3945581 sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium totam rem aperiam eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo
3945582 id like to see you write a follow up on who should take advantage of this credit
3945583 being that its a loan it obviously isnt going to be economical for everyone
3945584 i am not in any way struggling to pay my mortgage and i dont have credit card debt
3945585 sure i need a lawn mower and i wouldnt mind the boost in my savings since my down payment wiped me out but is this tax credit really economical if i dont really need the money for anything except immediate gratification
3945586 they feel like they have enough capital but nobody really knows
3945587 are a relatively unknown portion of the mortgage market but could be another wrinkle for mortgage lending
3945588 so thats today what happens a year from now that is the concern out there that these companies will face more problems ahead
3945589 in terms of the scope and international dimension of this attack its a landmark
3945590 international laws are very poorly developed so it really crosses a line into murky territory is an information blockade an act of war
3945591 seems like the kind of thing that a sophisticated military would want to experiment with
3945592 imagine how devastating it would be to a military commander to lose access to a server that tells him where his troops are stationed and where he has resources
3945593 this is the first time weve had such strong evidence of cyberwarfare
3945594 its an ongoing battle in documenting where its coming from and helping people get around it
3945595 when a subject becomes totally obsolete we make it a required course
3945596 were concerned about how thats going to be utilized by people who will be potentially disruptive
3945597 sorry i cant loosen them i dont have the tools to do that
3945598 give them no choices make them act in accordance with my fathers laws
3945599 beat the blacks i e people from the caucasus region and central asia
3945600 if he decides to talk to you then hell tell you his own story
3945601 we decided to patrol the area around the prospekt bolshevikov metro station there was a dorm for foreign students there and these students were often attacked wed do three hour beats like idiots and we froze to death but we didnt spot a single nazi one day we decided to ask the guys in the dorm where the nazis usually hang out we sent one of our guys in the students got scared they pointed out to the window to where the rest of us were standing there they are they couldnt tell the difference between normal skinheads that is us and boneheads
3945602 i dont consider every wino in a bomber jacket and suspenders a fascist
3945603 here in petersburg we have a few hundred serious enemies of course there are morons like the mad crowd this nazi gang that stabs kids in stairwells but i think they do harm to their own cause the murder of a child is not something you can justify in any way and youre not going to earn praise that way in the main the boneys are so so fighters who are backed up by a so so organization its just that there are lots of them more than us and there are more of them all the time and their training just gets better all the same theyre mostly cowards they prefer to run as soon as theyre attacked they fear us more than we fear them because we really know who were dealing with
3945604 well what can she think she says shes against violence but im also against it hitler himself said that if the communists had stopped the fascists on the streets before it was too late then wwii wouldnt have happened
3945605 when i found out at the age of seventeen that there are such people
3945606 i made up my mind that was it that id had enough
3945607 well id get beaten up and abused i had long hair piercings and a skateboard and it wasnt yobs that were doing this but real nazis theyd say you live in russia respect russian culture respect russian culture what does that mean to walk around in felt boots and play the balalaika on the contrary subcultures are signs of a developed society in third world countries there are no punks and no skaters are there subculturalists in zimbabwe
3945608 they just stole everything from us the way we look the way we dress so now everyone thinks that a shaven head means youre a fascist do you know who the real skinheads were they were regular white guys who worked in factories in england with workers from jamaica and none of them worried about ethnicity it was a workers movement a class movement they were just anarchists absolute internationalists
3945609 even nowadays it happens that a bonehead begins to see that real skinheads are a whole different crowd and goes antifa
3945610 come on do you know anyone like that who has changed sides
3945611 i wanted to make something of myself to feel that i was strong i thought that nazis were cool but we didnt do anything all that bad we beat up punks but it wasnt serious we didnt use knives and then i realized that this ideology was total crap
3945612 well it was gradual and then i saw a news report about timur kacharava and i came to my senses i thought what is going on i never wanted to kill anyone im generally a peaceful guy an anarchist
3945613 i dont think itll be my main profession ill probably be redefining and searching for myself my whole life i reject all forms of politics i just want to grow up have a family raise kids and not be a drag on anyone
3945614 you know the anarchists have this motto everyone is different but equal
3945615 what difference does it make that we have different political views when we get together we dont talk about politics
3945616 then what is the goal of antifa what is your and homers common goal to defeat fascism
3945617 the goal is to stop racist violence on the streets and were successful at this whereas before the nazis felt safe in this city and walked around in full battle gear this isnt the case anymore
3945618 and the subculturalists simply got fed up thats why they made the move to reciprocal violence
3945619 and so now the nazis are afraid to advertise their views
3945620 partly theyre afraid of the police lately the cops havent been so tender with them but theyre also afraid of us
3945621 well yeah we had this tolerance training and there i realized i had to oppose fascism somehow first i read all the sites in the internet then i wrote on a forum that i wanted to join antifa i asked to be introduced to someone and so i was introduced
3945622 hes a lot of trouble his parents naturally have no clue what hes up to i shouldnt stay quiet but i also dont have the right to tell his parents
3945623 they divide up approximately fifty fifty moreover it might just be the case that recently the attitude to gays has become more tolerant and in any case half the students stay on the fascist side
3945624 i try to affect them through experiences including my own im from estonia myself and so i tell them about how people in estonia related to the fact that i was russian or i talk about the fact that i panic when i see gypsies but that i nevertheless realized that the problem is with me not with the gypsies it is me who is afraid of them this isnt their fault such training sessions are dangerous if you dont know what youre doing then youll probably end up with the opposite result that is why no top down tolerance programs work all the more so when neither the state nor schools are tolerant a teacher who doesnt respect her own students cannot teach them to be tolerant towards others
3945625 what do you think of street violence including the violence perpetrated by antifascists
3945626 but those of us who advocate nonviolent forms of resistance realize that we are beginning to lose out to supporters of violent methods because people join antifa not only because they want to do good and be useful but also for the drive and buzz that you can get only on the streets this is particularly apparent nowadays when all the youth movements including fascists and antifascists have suddenly gotten younger after all when a person grows older he acquires some values whereas it used to be that the average age of all subculturalists was twenty today all seniors know the score
3945627 why is it wrong to fight the fascists with their own methods
3945628 because you cannot defeat violence with violence you cant make the world more tolerant with your fists most important the people who are involved in this dont notice how they become more and more aggressive themselves first youre an antifascist then youre a football hooligan then youre just fighting not for a just cause but simply because you like to fight
3945629 pyotr im afraid that more and more lately he just likes fighting for its own sake
3945630 i was charged either with jaywalking or defaming the governor
3945631 they didnt want to draw attention to the people we came out against
3945632 my parents are siege survivors i understand you so well
3945633 there are fascists everywhere but its especially unpleasant to see them in this city of course
3945634 so its hard to say how many antifascists prepared for direct action there are in the city
3945635 there around a hundred people who regularly participate in actions
3945636 there are things you dont need to be tolerant about i myself hate fascism with a wild animal like hatred im an intolerant person
3945637 to put it cynically while the boneys are distracted with us they kill fewer tadjiks and uzbeks
3945638 its not enough but its important so you cannot say that the violence our people commit is wholly unjustified
3945639 the moscow bonehead movement is evolving along these same lines the only difference is that the boneys who do the killing are younger if there are people who have these proclivities and society justifies such behavior they quite quickly become addicted to violence
3945640 the day before there was an antifascist concert at a club someone said that the nazis were having a rally the following day lets go and kick the shit out of them we agreed on a time to meet and went there
3945641 they turned out to be real morons what absurd things they said during the trial the judge asks them how they came to be at the scene of the incident they had so much time to come up with something they all had lawyers moreover they even gave their testimony with their lawyers present but they had these spiels like i just happened to be walking by when a bottle hit me in the head i honestly thought they were smarter and more dangerous but they simply repeat from the podium what people say during conversations at home with friends and family about blacks taking over and all the rest but theyre not organized at all
3945642 i have an acquaintance who got an honors degree in sociology he works as a parking attendant
3945643 neither i nor my daughter ever talked to him about such things
3945644 we would like to dedicate our next song to the memory of our grandfathers who fought against fascism
3945645 they fought against fascism they marched forward and didnt know that there would be new deaths in a new fascist war
3945646 all the money we raise will go to our comrades in the petersburg branch of the anarchist black cross
3945647 you can look at it that youre donating fifty rubles to this organization and getting our album as a gift
3945648 the next piece is called hell on earth its about ecology which we think is really important including for our leningrad region just recently as you probably heard there was a leak of harmful substances at the atomic plant near petersburg although the authorities and the greenpeacers assure us that in fact nothing happened we know the truth
3945649 i call on all of you to become vegetarians theyve filled your heads with this crap that you cant do bodybuilding if you dont eat meat but in fact the protein in dairy products is more nutritious its also fucked up to wear fur and leather
3945650 what were trying to say is that antifascists cant limit themselves to banging the crap out of boneys fascism is not only on the in our kitchens in parliament we have to change public consciousness when people stop saying at home that the blacks have moved in the boneys will just automatically disappear from the streets
3945651 but we try to explain that the task is not to kill fascists but let them know that theyre not safe that what they do is bad and theyll be punished especially when were not talking about murderers but kids who out of sheer stupidity put on bomber jackets and go out hunting for blacks what i fear most of all is that our guys will began killing such kids but so that they dont fight like madmen i always tell our guys always think before attacking figure out whom youre up against our task is not to smack one more bonehead in the mug but to put a stop to their violence
3945652 my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness
3945653 extensive real time blogosphere coverage using nms proprietary combination of software and trained human analysts feel free to
3945654 has been a source of recent controversy as protesters picketed a theater in response to the productions insensitive treatment of the
3945655 rosales has been here longer has probably pitched a little bit better and buckner is a guy that needs to get stretched out for longer stints potentially in september
3945656 you never want to promise anybody anything and well see how it all plays out at the end
3945657 but he has pitched well enough for us to consider bringing him back here
3945658 however they need me to contribute i want them to trust the fact that i can
3945659 hopefully i did that i tried to do everything the right way and approach the game the right way hopefully they saw it that way
3945660 losing the last few years wasnt the deciding factor although it didnt help
3945661 i have 10 grandchildren now i had one four years ago id like to spend some more time with them i have a beautiful home up in napa calif it got so that i wanted to spend more time up there than at the ballpark and that wasnt a good thing for the fans
3945662 our new television contract with comcast is terrific and it puts us in a good position
3945663 our minor league teams have had the second best record in baseball over the last two seasons only the yankees have done better so there are good players coming our attendance at at amp t park is down a little but were still going to draw 2 8 million
3945664 that will break our record of 3 million every year for eight years in a row since the ballpark opened in 2000 but we expected that it was built in we knew this wouldnt be like 2007 we didnt have the all star game we didnt have a home series against the yankees we didnt have the home run chase we didnt have barry bonds
3945665 he said nice things about me he said nice things about everybody
3945666 he was very gracious i sat with him for a few innings and we had a nice talk
3945667 we dont think it was a mistake we needed to get through that and move on
3945668 just a matter of being close to 100 percent i want to be able to make that throw in the hole make a double play ben zobrist has done a great job if im not going to be able to perform like i can im going to try and get better so i can
3945669 i want to be out there but i want to be able to make a routine throw to first
3945670 the balls sailing a lot trying to get that feeling back it just seems like i throw one and it will hurt and after that i favor it and it sails i guess its just a matter of figuring out a way to throw and getting out there hopefully tomorrow ill feel a lot better and go from there
3945671 im not there yet well see how he feels when he comes in tomorrow morning if he feels great and hes adament that hes fine i would consider it
3945672 when they said it wasnt broken i figured once the swelling went down id be all right
3945673 but you never want to change the way you throw my shoulder might get messed up if i do that you want to keep it as normal as possible but if i have to go with that middle finger then so be it
3945674 i want to be known as a whole season guy
3945675 second half guys dont get a chance to get to the second half if they dont have a good first half
3945676 early on he struggled trying to find his swing and all that but us as players we knew hed do what he was going to do
3945677 garrets been around a long time and with that swing you cant struggle for too long
3945678 its strange with what weve seen from garret the last couple years
3945679 its been a second half surge hed been so consistent over the course of his career that youve never notice these huge upswings or downswings its a trend you have to look at but its tough to put your finger on one thing
3945680 ive maintained that my whole career that i need to play every day to keep that familiarity
3945681 i dont work too well when i have days off at least thats what i feel the results may be different they might be positive but i know mentally i feel a lot better when i play every day

3945692 we know what we can do its not about lining up in formation and running a play now its about getting into a better play than the one we called in the huddle and running the one we like the best
3945693 from day one weve been way ahead of last year
3945694 we are working on timing of plays that we are running a lot of which we didnt run against baltimore
3945695 all those things were kind of on the hit parade and we will continue to work on those things about 20 per cent of the time and the other 80 per cent will be geared towards things that tampa bay does
3945696 i have a zero threshold for insignificant facts i will cut people off if they dont answer my question
3945697 being a state senator where i have a forum to criticize him

3945702 to millions of women it has been the great liberator over the past four decades allowing them the freedom to control their fertility and their relationships
3945703 a study by british scientists suggests that taking the pill can change a womans taste in men to those who are genetically less compatible
3945704 the pill is thought to disrupt an instinctive mechanism that brings together people with complementary genes and immune systems such a couple by passing on a wide ranging set of immune system genes increase their chances of having a healthy child that is not vulnerable to infection
3945705 couples with different genes are also less likely to experience fertility problems or miscarriages experts believe that women are naturally attracted to men with immune system genes different to their own because of their smell
3945706 commenting on the latest study the researchers said that it could indicate that
3945707 they said that this might not only impact on fertility and miscarriage risk but could even contribute to the end of relationships as women who stop or start taking the pill no longer find their boyfriend or husband so attractive
3945708 im confident that his or her identity will be maintained in this instance
3945709 the eu must be ready to engage including on the ground to support all efforts including those of the united nations and the osce for a lasting and peaceful settlement of the conflicts in georgia

3945719 they are readying to move to other places the government is cheating us and cheating the international community they are going to destroy all the places to control them
3945720 on march 29 the first round of the presidential election which he won you voted for change you have been clear we will not betray you

3945722 i jumped out of my car and saw bodies in the streets
3945723 wherever i saw a body moving i helped carry them to a car to drive them to the hospital
3945724 there is no religion in the world that accepts such acts
3945725 against the hands that try to disrupt its security and stability
3945726 lebanon and the lebanese will not kneel or submit to the criminals and the terrorists

3945729 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
3945730 its crucial that i spend the coming season without any injury its most important that i show all i can on the pitch
3945731 many chances will come along during the coming year whats important is how i grab those chances
3945732 i dont know why somebody does this its not explainable
3945733 phillips knew that his actions would result in the death of chandler grafner
3945734 i dont know why somebody does this its not explainable
3945735 we had direct conflicting medical testimony from people on both sides they really took a lot of the same evidence and told us very different things
3945736 ive got nieces and nephews everyone on the jury has nieces or nephews or sons and daughters you cant imagine this happening to a child
3945737 i prepare the same way and at the end of it all i will be holding the belt again

3945745 this is a great example of dna coming through even in property crimes
3945746 its just an fbi utility vehicle it was an older van with not markings on the outside
3945747 i dont even know if the guy knew he had taken things from the fbi
3945748 an offense report was not written on this situation and an arrest was not made

3945750 the document is presumed open to the public unless sealed by court order
3945751 bagels eggs bacon sausage and fresh fruit plus unlimited draft beers several to choose from and bloody marys
3945752 this is an important potential cure it is possible one injection could switch off the abnormal immune response
3945753 if it works it could reverse the disease and stop further episodes
3945754 based on previous laboratory research we would expect that this will specifically suppress or down regulate the auto immune response
3945755 keep on sending those text i appreciate them extremely many thanks for cheering me up always
3945756 we will now need to review the full range of our relations
3945757 has been very clear for a long time ive been very concerned about russian behavior in a broad variety of areas
3945758 address the future of the alliances relationship with russia and with our g7 partners we should discuss whether it makes sense for russia to continue its participation in the g8
3945759 we also need to review russias aspiration for membership in the world trade organization
3945760 i dont think were going to re ignite the cold war here with russia i dont see this is a return to nuclear standoffs
3945761 as the russians move into georgia as aggressors and if you read the statements from the beginning from senator mccain and senator obama one had a kind of moral neutrality to it that comes i think from inexperience
3945762 basta ang initial info po sa amin ay legal operation po ito pero hindi pa namin alam ang nature ng operation the initial info we got was that it was a legal operation but we didnt know the nature of the operation
3945763 to show that the numbers on those questioned certificates of canvass match their corresponding statements of votes and election returns
3945764 produce at least 10 000 new election returns duly accompanied by the appropriate comelec envelopes officially numbered envelope seals and the official comelec inks for thumb marking
3945765 he roque said the money for this special operation will be provided by pgma arroyos initials as a matter of fact a few days thereafter i was told by attorney bello that commissioner garcillano met with pgma at her la vista home to receive the money
3945766 depending on the severity of the case well put them on a suicide watch until we can get them hooked up or get them with the jail psychiatrist
3945767 he was doing what every other teenager would be doing
3945768 deliverance from sin and penalty realized in a future state
3945769 a new report has found that the vast majority of indian mobile phone users have received adverts on their handsets
3945770 but i never even illegally downloaded anything because you told me i couldnt
3945771 its probably that hunter guy the owners told us would be calling
3945772 dont you want to know what it was all about
3945773 he was doing a background check on a guy who used to live next door a few years ago for a job i told him we just moved here and we never heard of him
3945774 this takes us back to the beginning of the last century when public artworks were censored back in britain at the beginning of modern sculpture
3945775 he was a great philanthropist giving an enormous amount of his wealth back to the community through a great number of charities
3945776 mr ilhan was also a great promoter of victoria and in particular melbournes northwestern suburbs and it is fitting that this recreation reserve is named in his honour
3945777 be conservative in what you do be liberal in what you accept from others
3945778 in this age of 4 a gallon gas and staycations we felt that vudu customers deserved a break and should be able to watch a great film for just 99 cents
3945779 these initiatives are groundbreaking our 99 cent rental renewal is a first in our industry and will make it easier for our viewers to finish watching a great movie when it fits their schedule not ours
3945780 its a fact that tisha is the most competitive girl i know

3945787 it emerges as the natural prediction for a social situation under the assumption that players are guided by their own interest
3945788 they felt very strongly that the votes of those 38 senators on a property tax cap was absolutely devastating to education and we needed to make a statement about that as clearly as we could
3945789 if in fact the union decides that its going to throw its considerable clout in support of candidates that support their position if they do that than i think it could be a real problem for some of these state senators who are in districts that are very competitive this year
3945790 its to show the assembly members that the teachers really meant it when they said they opposed it and theres a cost if you say you support the proposal
3945791 youre not going to do the political expedient thing youre not going to pander to the hysteria thats out there youre going to stay with education and with that in mind weve moved forward with our endorsements
3945792 im not aware of any other case in this country where the government has accepted a claim against it for abuse of public office and paid such a large amount to a private individual
3945793 what it means is the government has thrown in the towel its accepted responsibility for what happened to pan
3945794 it has come at great personal cost which cannot be fully compensated by any agreed amount of damages
3945795 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history

3945810 which professed to outline what business practices were forbidden by ubs ran directly contrary to the actual ubs business practices which were actively encouraged by ubs senior management
3945811 reviewing the results and formulating a number of recommendations to management
3945812 it is clear that birkenfeld on numerous occasions told ubs and the higher ups at ubs of its improper practices unfortunately his notifications fell on deaf ears
3945813 it says fit for purpose for the next 21 years no impediment to continued safe operations
3945814 its all about presence its all about being top of mind the more stages we continue to take ourselves off of the more difficult the overall mission becomes
3945815 in order to be more than the great white north or more than just a trading partner like others i think we have to show how interwoven the connections are and how broad that cultural mix really is
3945816 you should be aware of your rights so as to ensure that you secure your full entitlements as well as being aware of the obligations of your chief officer and police authority under those regulations and determinations
3945817 our members together with chief officers and police authorities are expected to comply with their obligations under the police regulations and determinations this is particularly so when police officers are dissatisfied with the way we are being treated by the government
3945818 the official side offered the police a three year pay deal which was one of the most generous in the public sector regrettably they rejected it that is why we were forced to offer a one year deal
3945819 the fed is not a counterfeiter all it does is print paper dollars and use them
3945820 the fed is not a counterfeiter whether the fed is desirable or not all it does is print paper dollars and use them to buy bonds then it stands ready to use those bonds to buy back the dollars it issues i could do the same thing
3945821 i suspect if you drilled into the details of fractional reserve banking and its implications youd be quite dismayed
3945822 then it stands ready to use those bonds to buy back the dollars it issues
3945823 i owe you nothing this is just a piece of paper and i will print as many of them as i wish to buy whatever suckers like you will give for them
3945824 then it stands ready to use those bonds to buy back the dollars it issues
3945825 the fed is not a counterfeiter whether the fed is desirable or not all it does is pr

3945833 if people could relate to this person this character that makes me feel kinda weird
3945834 i do think wallpaper is dealing with some serious subject matter in a way theres excitement and fun but there is a composition process that is very serious to me you never get any filler and that is important
3945835 it turned out to be 15 minutes total like 15 minutes of fame
3945836 its a great personal disconnect when they are worn youre pretty much blind on stage

3945842 this cell phone is lifetime this cell phone is free
3945843 in an interview you mentioned that wallpaper was created during a time of hyphy and a re emergence of musicians representing that bay area sound which made you want to pay tribute
3945844 do you think you are successfully doing that instead of being a cover band
3945845 i really think the answer is in the eyes of the beholder and it comes down to authenticity which is a dangerous term for a long time people thought things like jazz and white rappers were cheap shots at peoples nostalgia but both of those things proved longevity when people see the passion for a project such as wallpaper i think that is proof i think there is a big difference between irony and satire oh yeah heres this white guy singing but it is serious i think developing something like this is incredible and super funny and honestly i wouldnt be surprised if this record gets canned
3945846 but what happens when people dont get what youre doing
3945847 are you a joke band are you making fun of yourselves others
3945848 either you get it or you dont i think thats what it comes down to

3945896 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3945897 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3945898 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3945899 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3945900 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
3945901 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3945902 were proud of anyone who has worked on the side of angels in fledgling democracies
3945903 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3945904 as you know through the nato membership if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all
3945905 i do not see any obtainable objectives in lebanon and the longer we stay there the harder it will be to leave
3945906 if you get involved in a major ground war in the saudi desert i think support will erode significantly
3945907 nor should it be supported we cannot even contemplate in my view trading american blood for iraqi blood
3945908 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3945909 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
3945910 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
3945911 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
3945912 and i think ridge is a great example of that
3945913 far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights you know a number of other issues
3945914 in europe the media has been quite nasty about my private life and nosy and sometimes it hurts but you learn to live with that
3945915 the one thing i want to leave my children is an honorable name
3945916 it is hard to fail but it is worse never to have tried to succeed

3945919 youll be calling us back within a couple months wanting to come back
3945920 i know youre scared im here squeeze my hand when youre afraid
3945921 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
3945922 being a state senator where i have a forum to criticize him
3945923 when youre down there at the capitol every day and youre frustrated sure you think about it
3945924 now im home with my wife and kids and my frustration level isnt pegging out at 110 percent
3945925 he did real well he was able to put a different hat on
3945926 the border has been along this river for 1 000 years
3945927 they breached the agreement they occupied territory that belongs to zugdidi district
3945928 the people of gamukhuri are in a panic and they are leaving under very heavy psychological pressure from the other side

3945930 id love to if i can find the right movie
3945931 actually i have a part that just came up were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children
3945932 but this city was facing hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal expenses well be better off getting the ordinance off the books
3945933 we want to put as many restrictions on as we think will pass the supreme court muster
3945934 we dont want people to have handguns in evanston but right now the law is against us this was pragmatic were being sued itd be nice to fight for principal but we dont have the money to fight
3945935 citizens must have a way to resist criminals and a handgun is the best way to do that
3945936 they also significantly increased our presence with key customers in the intelligence community

3945940 i had some stomach issues a couple of days before the 400 im and it just ended like two days ago
3945941 to be able to double out of a 200 back youre lucky 15 minutes later to be able to walk much less swim another event in the top two or three times in the world
3945942 as the russians move into georgia as aggressors and if you read the statements from the beginning from senator mccain and senator obama one had a kind of moral neutrality to it
3945943 and i say it respectfully to senator obama because hes a gifted young man but hes not ready to be president on jan 20th of 2009
3945944 i think that whatever we think at the moment that we can all reserve that for a future time
3945945 and i think judgments will be made about how we handled this situation how we approached the situation in iraq and how much experience and knowledge and background means in selecting the american peoples decision about who should be commander in chief
3945946 but i dont think were going to reignite the cold war here with russia i think this is a very serious situation but i dont see this as a return to nuclear standoffs et cetera et cetera
3945947 discussions about an international peacekeeping operation including canvassing nations for possible contributions to such a force
3945948 im sorry to be repetitious this is no time for that this is no time for that the time now is for the united states of america to act united on behalf of the people of the country of georgia and not do a lot of partisan sniping
3945949 and i say it respectfully to senator obama because hes a gifted young man but hes not ready to be president on jan 20th of 2009
3945950 yesterday i heard senator mccain say we are all georgians now
3945951 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
3945952 devil went down to georgia and he was willing to make a deal
3945953 mccain wanted to make a distinction between himself and obama he did he overreacted was shooting from the hip and showed that he had an opinion before he had the facts this is what bush did in iraq mccain may even be more dangerous because he did not learn from iraq bush at least waited until the facts were available
3945954 having to chose between these two unqualified pro globalization back slappers is a disgrace at least hillary seemed like she had a brain between her ears
3945955 i usually only grant three wishes so i ll give each of you just one
3945956 i want to be in the bahamas driving a speedboat without a care in the world

3945960 he said the building is on fire you gotta get out of there he said look theres smoke up there in that apartment above you i looked up and smoke was billowing all out of there
3945961 looked like there had been a fire but the room wasnt smokey or anything didnt smell like smoke
3945962 this was a real good fire biggest fire weve had in probably 5 or 6 years
3945963 changes in consumer behavior have essentially erased five years of growth in gasoline demand
3945964 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems

3945973 i like him hes a competitive player that can make big shots and one of those guys that is capable of rising to important times and obviously we want to be playing in those times
3945974 all these guys are very excited they respect mo as a player and theyre looking forward to playing with him
3945975 i think this is a move to be able to get a talented young 25 year old point guard that can be part of the future
3945976 his most productive days in the nba were just a few short years ago when he had ray allen on one wing and rashard lewis on the other wing
3945977 here you say you have michael redd on one wing and richard jefferson on another wing youre putting luke ridnour in the best possible position to be successful again as he has been in the past
3945978 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back
3945979 we understand that its a unique opportunity here specifically but weve got to do the best thing for our basketball team and we feel like the best thing for our basketball team is to add some toughness and some intangibles defensively for us at that position

3945988 seek help in patience and as salat and truly it is extremely heavy and hard except for the true believers in allah those who obey allah with full submission fear much from his punishment and believe in his promise and his warnings
3945989 those to whom the people said surely men have gathered against you therefore fear them but this increased their faith and they said allah is sufficient for us and most excellent is the protector so they returned with favor from allah and his grace no evil touched them and they followed the pleasure of allah and allah is the lord of mighty grace it is only the shaitan that causes you to fear from his friends but do not fear them and fear me if you are believers
3945990 ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in your personal selves and ye shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the book before you and from those who worship many gods but if ye persevere patiently and guard against evil then that will be a determining factor in all affairs

3945992 we are weighing all the options and looking at all of them for whatever the next step will be
3945993 the last thing for us would be a strike our teachers are there for the kids and we dont want that but it is an option
3945994 if we agree to this discipline article we are throwing out our bill of rights
3945995 they are give and take on both sides its not a done deal until everyone ratifies it
3945996 we are going back to law school 101 on contracts where an offer is made and an offer is accepted
3945997 here an offer has been made but the teachers have not accepted it they are not bound by it it is not a done deal until everyone accepts it
3945998 the reason it is called a tentative agreement is because its tentative
3945999 if one side says no that is not a good contract at that point you either go back to the bargaining table or worst case scenario there would be a strike deadline
3946000 we feel there is a total lack of respect from a system that has always had a respect for its teachers
3946001 our body cant understand why they are not coming back to the table to get this solved
3946002 i have no idea what the board is thinking because i can go down the line

3946010 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3946011 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3946012 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3946013 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3946014 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3946018 acquisition need not be completed by end of 2008 for favorable judgement
3946019 everybody is curious to know whether kim hae nam can lift the barbell he nearly shouted this moment he has just lifted the barbell up to his shoulders up up yes he made it fellow countrymen please rejoice
3946020 patriotic coverage of sporting events naturally even the most cool headed announcer and analytic commentator may lose their composure when their countrys athletes are in a close race against their foreign rivals
3946021 hes won a gold medal good its good to cry for joy
3946022 democracy is a smashed boat in a sea of garbage
3946023 last year going into preseason practice everything was pretty cut and dry
3946024 i had pretty much everyone returning but this year we lost four players we lost our one and two singles players which is huge and then we lost two other girls who played doubles for us
3946025 losing loni at first singles and ali at second singles is huge just because they were instrumental in us doing as well as we did last year
3946026 i dont want to say that were inexperienced this year but we just dont have the experience that we have had in the past
3946027 we dont have as many veterans as weve had in the past our top four girls will be ready to go but im still working on where everyone is going to play because some of the girls are going to be playing singles and doubles depending on the matchups and who were playing
3946028 trisha has been playing in some big tournaments and shes very dedicated and her game is coming along very well
3946029 shes going to be going against some of the best players in the state so shes going to have her hands full sometimes but thats just going to make her better i think shes looking forward to the challenge to see how shes going to compete against those players
3946030 theres nothing really set in stone with singles and doubles yet
3946031 thats the problem when you lose two good singles players like we did you have to decide if youre going to pull up some of your doubles players to play singles or just develop some of the younger players in singles
3946032 were still working on different doubles combinations and trying to figure those out
3946033 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
3946034 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3946035 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3946036 one of the most satanic shows in the history of humanity
3946037 weve been playing some good one day cricket we were no 1 in the world earlier this year and were a proud nation
3946038 for us to come over here and win a test series and a one day series in england would be a big achievement and were all really keen to do that
3946039 ive tried to keep myself fit during my time off and played a couple of games for durham and then after that club cricket but adapting to international cricket again is going to be my big challenge irrespective of the conditions
3946040 getting used to the intensity that international players play at again is going to be my biggest step
3946041 i was extremely upset at the fact that they would pull such a stunt
3946042 it is shameful it is offensive sexist homophobic and it is racist and were going to make sure it ends and it ends immediately
3946043 this is a dark day an extremely dark day in the history of the san francisco police department
3946044 well who actually compelled your attendance to the press conference
3946045 the mayors office scheduled the press conference as the chief it was my responsibility to be there i normally would not hold a press conference to discuss a disciplinary matter
3946046 it seems like theyre just going after me they just want to affect me and im assuming they just want to get rid of me but ill fight them until its all exonerated
3946047 any time you have an accusation that a police officer violated a court order thats something that raises questions about his credibility about his ability to do a job and its something that should be looked into
3946048 if it was done with cohens knowledge consent or instruction then he would be liable for indirectly violating a court order by delivering the tape or having it delivered to channel 7
3946049 im disappointed in this administration im disappointed in our union for not standing up for us so i think disappointment is the key now the angers gone i dont have any anger for them its just time to move on
3946050 i would say to my kids i do not want to see you out here after 8 o clock
3946051 we brought in additional officers additional training gave officers crowd control techniques and the bad activity slowed down
3946052 we probably have more police officers on hand per square foot than any city in the country
3946053 now it is safe for all of us to be out here
3946054 more and more families are out here and staying late
3946055 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
3946056 weve seen this in the past before in motorolas razr line it was a very big seller but the first version of that phone had rf radio frequency problems they had to recall it fix it and put it back out there
3946057 it could end up drawing more power because now the phone thinks its getting a worse signal than it actually is when it goes to talk to the network it speaks louder than it needs to
3946058 according to his own television ad jay nixon opposes extending the very popular marriage and child tax credit
3946059 according to his own television ad jay nixon opposes efforts to increase our supply of domestic energy
3946060 the more he communicates with voters the more jay nixon reveals his extreme liberal leanings he cant help himself
3946061 every time one of congressman hulshofs opponents whether its jay nixon or sarah steelman has drawn attention to his washington record the congressman immediately says we just dont understand washington like he does fair point congressman hulshof is certainly more fluent in washington talk than the rest of us but thats not a valid excuse for him to avoid defending his votes when will congressman hulshof stand up and defend his washington record
3946062 were trying to get this to be an annual event
3946063 the b 17 is really the one that bombed germany so was the b 24 the p 51 escorted them all the way to berlin and back
3946064 its just amazing the number of people who bring their fathers who were in world war ii and buy them a ride they just love it
3946065 the bush administration will soon propose regulations to protect healthcare professionals from being forced to participate in immoral practices astonishingly abortion proponents vehemently oppose this they are against the right of doctors to choose not to do abortions
3946066 federal laws protect the right of healthcare providers not to participate in abortion or other controversial practices but the laws are ignored recently two medical associations passed guidelines that could require doctors to commit or refer for abortions
3946067 planned parenthood and some media are trying to frame the new regulations as an attack on contraception
3946068 abortion advocates are causing a ruckus about a rule that simply requires health agencies to follow the law and not to discriminate against people with moral beliefs against taking an innocent life
3946069 secretary leavitt provided an excellent explanation on his blog its been flooded with negative comments from abortion advocates demanding that health providers do whatever a woman demands
3946070 as patients we depend with our lives on health providers to be moral but if ethical professionals with strong consciences are forced out of the profession patients will suffer the most
3946071 the history of behavior of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat
3946072 we have outstanding student athletes in our program and we will move forward in a positive manner toward our goals
3946073 i want to personally apologize for any embarrassment that may have been caused for our athletic department the university and our fans
3946074 if nebraska is going to be pigheaded and kick him off unreasonably
3946075 there has to be another wrestling program thats going to want him
3946076 its not money that they would be making working as a waiter
3946077 im in my mid 40s and my generation has a stigma about porn
3946078 the kids the generation of the student athletes dont have that stigma
3946079 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3946080 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3946081 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3946082 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3946083 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3946084 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3946085 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3946086 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3946087 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
3946088 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
3946089 a community proving that a community of pervs cares more about her education than an administration full of assholes
3946090 the battle is won but the war is not over
3946091 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3946092 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3946101 these results suggest that the effect of dextromethorphan on blocking methamphetamine induced rewarding and behavioral sensitization may be related to its effect on inhibiting the activity of dopamine neurons projected to medial prefrontal cortex and or nucleus accumbens
3946102 conclusion these data indicate that the memantine methamphetamine combination produced novel discriminative stimulus effects and that memantine produced some stimulant like subjective effects
3946103 first they gave the rats a bunch of coke while flashing a light

3946108 she was never going to win but she dug deep and found something to get her over the line by the barest of margins it sums australia up as athletes we are tough with a bit of mongrel that just doesnt let us give up
3946109 as long as you are in the green and gold they will be screaming for you even if they have never heard of you before its a bit like wearing the baggy green
3946110 whilst you are all individual athletes you are a team an athletics team but also part of a 420 something strong olympic team so use the opportunity that presents to talk to people from other sports keep an eye on your teammates and support them when its tough because it might be that support that helps them to go the extra yard when they have to
3946111 they are a bit different they are tough committed and never give up
3946112 there is no room for could have should have would have and might have you dont need to make excuses because you have done the hard work now you just need to look for the one or two percenters keep a positive and contagious attitude and get out there and make us proud
3946113 affected staff can express their preferences about their future to the bank which is good news

3946116 in these tough economic time 4 just isnt good enough espeically when the bank is making such a large profit and the difference for the bank between what we are asking for and what is being offered is so small
3946117 at some point on the rope line an overly enthusiastic supporter shook her hand
3946118 out of an abundance of caution she left the event
3946119 i broke my wrist shaking hands i just thought it was sore but i had stress fractures up my arm so i guess there is a downside to campaigning
3946120 ive been on varsity all four of my high school years and ive been to states all three years im the senior and the captain and the leader if you have questions girls know they can come to me and well talk
3946121 i couldnt have experienced the last three years without them theyre like our girls now friends on and off the course we know that if one of us is having a bad day then there will be someone else there for us to fall back on you have the reliability on someone who is going to be there for you i think that really helps us
3946122 when it comes to golf were teammates and friends and were serious about golf before and after the match we joke around with each other its nice to just be able to relax and know that we back each other up
3946123 we like having a nice big on our back and having everyone after as
3946124 for some reason that we dont make it to states as a team my first choice is that i want my girls to be there but if that doesnt happen then i would hope that i shoot a low enough score that i would get there and have a fourth year state experience
3946125 for being as little as i am i can usually crank a couple good drives
3946126 ive had some people say taylor for being so little you can really hit the ball people now realize that i might be little but i can golf pretty well
3946127 when i golf its me against the course and the girls that im playing with are the same i dont play against people
3946128 if someone else comes in with a better round than me then they come in with better round

3946132 theres a tendency in our decolonization movements our racial justice struggles to see gendered justice as kind of an add on like once we get liberated well deal with this issue and we fail to see that it is percisely through a logic of sexual violence that colonialism and white supremacy work
3946133 your honor this defendant has a long history of breaking the law heres their school record
3946134 student b believes that he was punished because of his race which he cannot control so he changes nothing and keeps getting in trouble since people tend to seek confirming evidence for their beliefs student b considers each incident more evidence that he has no control over his fate
3946135 we were not surprised by the fine performance of the liege side we had seen enough of them to know they were a good aggressive side
3946136 the real surprise for me was the way liverpool played the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
3946137 we will have to be a lot better in the second leg at anfield much better
3946138 we have been playing well in pre season looking confident and passing the ball well
3946139 but we did not do any of those things i did not want to bring
3946140 we waited until well into the second half before using him but we were not controlling the game and i had to bring him on
3946141 this game was far more difficult than we expected and jose reina was the man of the match
3946142 we know we can always rely on pepe to stop penalties but we have been told that the other effort may have been behind the line but these things happen
3946143 liverpool maybe came here asleep and not expecting this sort of game
3946144 maybe though we have woken them up for the second leg which will me much harder for us
3946145 we felt that if we did not lose this first leg we would still be in with a chance

3946149 this is an absolutely critical election at a challenging time for our country
3946150 i want to make sure that colorado has an election that is transparent where every vote is counted and theres no question about who wins the presidential election in the state of colorado
3946151 i plan on visiting every single county on inspection tours and making sure that theyre ready for this election to look at their security plan to protect the integrity of the ballots how many voting locations they have
3946152 thats going to take the bulk of my time and thats my first priority whatever time i have left ill probably devote to my own campaign
3946153 this is a management position it doesnt make policy and whoever holds this office is responsible to all the people of the state not their political party
3946154 i was pretty happy with the pb and the win and putting up the fourth best time on the day was also really cool
3946155 overall my european campaign was a lot different to last year last year it was kind of short and i was involved in a bus accident which wasnt great so this time it was a bit more racing and a lot longer because i didnt have world university games we planned to group races together to simulate running rounds so i had to get up tired and travel and everything and still come up we were just trying to put more onto the body and to replicate what its going to feel like in beijing and i really feel like i have it now
3946156 i was in the race and going along fine we got to about 300m and came out of the bend pretty even i was in lane six so the two or three main guys were on my inside and i just kind of got complacent i was almost happy where i was there was no this is it or this is life or death feeling so i ended up coming fourth i crossed the line thinking what was i doing it was a mental thing and i was just really disappointed
3946157 i ran a pb because i wanted it i got that real mental shift i guess what happened in belgium was just part of the learning process
3946158 where i am capability wise in my event is interesting theres a whole bunch of guys who can make that top eight theres probably four or five athletes who are definitely going to make the final the likes of wariner lashawn merritt and chris brown but theres probably two spots up for grabs and because the next group are all at a similar level its more about mental preparation its going to be about making sure that this really is it that it really is life or death because i dont want to wait another four years to get that sting in me i want to make sure i execute the race the way i want it to be executed and to leave nothing to chance
3946159 when im in there the final i have a secret tactic that im going to do im not sharing it yet so youll have to watch to see what happens anything can happen in the final i know its the olympic games but when the gun goes its just another race its another 400m against the same guys ive been racing on the circuit everyone is running for their country thats the difference and well its bigger
3946160 joels running wickedly what hes done in the last 12 to 18 months has just been amazing
3946161 our goal from the outset was to be in fighting form for the beijing olympics which is when we wanted to be running our best its very hard to do both domestic and european season in great shape so we ticked the boxes in australia and focused on now ideally i would have won another national title and run a lot faster in our meets but i was doing quite heavy blocks of training because it was all geared towards august even world indoors was another way of practicing rounds in my mind
3946162 compared to athens the crop of runners we have is as good or maybe better statistically we can run faster with everyones form at the moment its kind of hard to say to say whos going to run and how fast they are going to run if everything goes to plan we can definitely mix it with them we all believe we can do something
3946163 when i marched in the commonwealth games the way i felt when i walked out was amazing all these people going ballistic you know that this is what youve been training for you forget everything else when you walk out into that stadium and you are wearing your uniform the pain stress and work you have put in obviously what you are there to do is race but marching is about the recognition wearing the green and gold and a time for the athletes to be proud representatives of their country
3946164 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
3946165 you know madness is a lot like gravity all you need is a little push
3946166 when dud they leave and where did they go leopard hunting
3946167 were a few days off from seeing either of the brandons that could impact the running back battle as the team hopes to begin whittling down the field there to a workable number to get ready for a game by next week

3946173 when westcore acquired the property in 2005 the building was 100 leased to advanced marketing systems
3946174 that company went bankrupt and vacated the building in august 2007 and in december 2007 westcore was able to lease the entire building to qualcomm on a long term lease by re establishing the occupancy we were able to accomplish our business plan and meet our objectives for this asset
3946175 we all know i havent been running the best its been a pretty difficult year and now when it comes to it i have to make a decision its the individual event or the relay when you have five other guys depending on you you cant just make the decision based on yourself
3946176 you have to be up front and honest with the coach on what you can deliver because he is in charge of the relay team and making decisions for them
3946177 homes always a good place to clear your head and make decisions that arent rash so when i was there i decided that i can really contribute to the team whether i run or dont run i can help australia to be successful at this olympics so here i am
3946178 unfortunately when youve won before you know what it takes to be number one and you know how far away you are
3946179 every time ive gotten better this year something else has happened because ive been behind the eight ball i have more to lose by running badly than by staying home i could have taken the easy option and stayed at home but im here
3946180 theres not a lot you can do about the physical stuff at this stage so if you are a positive person and have good energy you can definitely help the other guys to be the best they possibly can whether you run or dont run
3946181 we all know when it comes to a relay that australia can pull something special out having clinton hill mark ormrod and me from athens we know how to work each others psyche so its a good opportunity i dont want to throw away
3946182 america is running the race on their own so really we won the last olympics then theres jamaica and the bahamas with a little bit more horse power than we have after that it goes nigeria japan great britain australia and poland we have the same horse power its just how we maneuver it to get the best out of it
3946183 we all need to pull our weight if we want to win a medal we are working really well together and have good camaraderie clinton is a great leader when it comes to relays and we have two guys with really great horse power in joel and sean really i feel we are in a good position without the pressure of commonwealth games where we were meant to win and we can go in there relaxed but with some expectation on ourselves
3946184 we would both love to be running individually but if the young guys see the confidence we have leading in to it it will help them to shine
3946185 you cant slap fate in the face im here for a reason and it would be wrong for me to throw it away because im not running well individually
3946186 trust me its hard to digest because in my head im number one
3946187 i just love it all the fairy tale against the odds story the great comebacks the old style voice overs and the back to back champions
3946188 she was never going to win but she dug deep and found something to get her over the line by the barest of margins it sums australia up as athletes we are tough with a bit of mongrel that just doesnt let us give up

3946194 i dont think we should aggravate the situation by arming christians there will always be hotheads that will probably move to spark the flames of war
3946195 dinig ko sabi ni presidente dahil report ng general ang kristiyano humihingi ng bala sabi ni presidente huwag bigyan at baka lalo lumaki ang sunog i heard the president respond to a report that christians are asking for bullets she gave instructions to deny the request lest it worsen the situation
3946196 jason and i have known each other from way back
3946197 i want to get reynoldsburg high school to the next level
3946198 i dont want to just be known in central ohio i want to be known statewide to be able to get to that level and compete at that level youve got to go against the best
3946199 an older coach once told me you know what when you line up and play the massillons and the canton mckinleys the st ignatiuses you dont want your kids to fear those schools you want to be able to go ahead and compete with them whereas now you go out and you scrimmage against teams like that youre going to get used to that level of competition and youll be able to raise your game
3946200 unfortunately for me i told my players that we were bringing massillon in here and were going to scrimmage and a couple of them didnt know who massillon was or where massillon was
3946201 that goes to tell you how far i have to go
3946202 ill be quite honest with you ive got a couple of sophomore kids who are fighting for playing time as well
3946203 the offense were bringing in here were running the triple option so weve got to find an athletic kid who can take charge and make good decisions its not necessarily and guarantee that hes going to be the guy right now but hes a good young man hes a leader and hes done a great job for us up to this point
3946204 one of the things they did last year was the kids learned one way they learned one position
3946205 were coming in fresh and were teaching everybody an offensive position and a defensive position were moving guys around just because a guy played corner last year that doesnt mean hes going to be a corner this year
3946206 we give everybody a chance in camp to go where they would like to play offensively and defensively and once we got into two a days were starting to make adjustments and moving people where its going to benefit the team

3946217 i think you need to evaluate if its a smart move for you maybe with one vehicle start there
3946218 i live in trussville im locked into to driving that 25 mile trip each way
3946219 im glad to be back in my classroom with a new group of students i love the beginning of the year
3946220 i feel blessed to live in a place where we have the medical knowledge to be able to take humpty dumpty and put him back together again because thats how i felt
3946221 she is just on the ball and ready to go and is very excited about being back
3946222 i just think we all do the best we can in whatever situation were given
3946223 the fact that i was able to get up and do what i needed to do that day just tells me i was not the one in control at all there
3946224 we were meant to survive that day we were meant to go off the road in just that particular place we did
3946225 my friends and my family and this community and the community that i live in pinson everyone has been so good to me
3946226 i told my teachers that we were going to have a very calm year this year
3946227 thats why we now find we are in a position to cut interest rates mr battellino added
3946228 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late mr battellino said
3946229 funding costs for the banks across all sources had probably fallen by about 25 to 30 basis points in recent weeks he told a federal parliamentary committee hearing in sydney
3946230 people have been pushing the banks to give more commitment to the fact that they would follow the reserve bank when the reserve bank cuts interest rates
3946231 the banks have responded to that quite cautiously and have been quite non committal
3946232 my guess is really whats happening here is the banks are saying well its unreasonable for them to give commitments when they dont know when the rba is going to move or by how much
3946233 overall when we look at all the evidence which we have its reasonable to conclude that the australian financial sector is competitive and that it stacks up quite well across a range of international benchmarks
3946234 our view is that these recent events are cyclical in nature and do not represent permanent change to the structure of the market in the sense that when markets settle we expect securitisation to pick up again mr battellino said
3946235 work choices is a thing of australias past not its future
3946236 we have already ended the making of australian workplace agreements because they did so much harm to australian working families
3946237 the workplace ombudsman will certainly respond if a complaint is made
3946238 the leaked documents show the company is determined to defy the rudd government on its industrial relations policy
3946239 the documents show telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3946240 so were now talking to our staff about collective agreements to make sure that they have the best terms and conditions
3946241 weve got this money but we dont know where its come from
3946242 we hebben met de speler een akkoord bereikt over een verlengd verblijf voor de komende vijf seizoenen
3946243 ah zei ik tegen ro dat lijkt me best wel eens leuk om te doen kijk dat ding geeft tours op het land dan is het een bus maar hij gaat ook te water
3946244 stalled vehicle causing the huge backup that made me about 30 minutes behind schedule this morning
3946245 get into the end zone he yelled loud enough to be heard in marysville
3946246 i was pretty happy with the pb and the win and putting up the fourth best time on the day was also really cool
3946247 overall my european campaign was a lot different to last year last year it was kind of short and i was involved in a bus accident which wasnt great so this time it was a bit more racing and a lot longer because i didnt have world university games we planned to group races together to simulate running rounds so i had to get up tired and travel and everything and still come up we were just trying to put more onto the body and to replicate what its going to feel like in beijing and i really feel like i have it now
3946248 i was in the race and going along fine we got to about 300m and came out of the bend pretty even i was in lane six so the two or three main guys were on my inside and i just kind of got complacent i was almost happy where i was there was no this is it or this is life or death feeling so i ended up coming fourth i crossed the line thinking what was i doing it was a mental thing and i was just really disappointed
3946249 i ran a pb because i wanted it i got that real mental shift i guess what happened in belgium was just part of the learning process
3946250 where i am capability wise in my event is interesting theres a whole bunch of guys who can make that top eight theres probably four or five athletes who are definitely going to make the final the likes of wariner lashawn merritt and chris brown but theres probably two spots up for grabs and because the next group are all at a similar level its more about mental preparation its going to be about making sure that this really is it that it really is life or death because i dont want to wait another four years to get that sting in me i want to make sure i execute the race the way i want it to be executed and to leave nothing to chance
3946251 when im in there the final i have a secret tactic that im going to do im not sharing it yet so youll have to watch to see what happens anything can happen in the final i know its the olympic games but when the gun goes its just another race its another 400m against the same guys ive been racing on the circuit everyone is running for their country thats the difference and well its bigger
3946252 joels running wickedly what hes done in the last 12 to 18 months has just been amazing
3946253 our goal from the outset was to be in fighting form for the beijing olympics which is when we wanted to be running our best its very hard to do both domestic and european season in great shape so we ticked the boxes in australia and focused on now ideally i would have won another national title and run a lot faster in our meets but i was doing quite heavy blocks of training because it was all geared towards august even world indoors was another way of practicing rounds in my mind
3946254 compared to athens the crop of runners we have is as good or maybe better statistically we can run faster with everyones form at the moment its kind of hard to say to say whos going to run and how fast they are going to run if everything goes to plan we can definitely mix it with them we all believe we can do something
3946255 when i marched in the commonwealth games the way i felt when i walked out was amazing all these people going ballistic you know that this is what youve been training for you forget everything else when you walk out into that stadium and you are wearing your uniform the pain stress and work you have put in obviously what you are there to do is race but marching is about the recognition wearing the green and gold and a time for the athletes to be proud representatives of their country
3946256 theres nothing like leaving it to the last minute but after nationals it was like ok im in the team with a bit of a relief and obviously a lot of excitement but then knowing that i was on that plane i could really put in some work i just hope that im building to beijing like i did through the domestic season because ive been getting better but im sure there is still more there
3946257 i have a good idea of how i want the competition to go you know over at the first attempt each time and ill need to be consistent but thats what i have been working for and its coming its not quite there yet but its close
3946258 im ready to make the final in beijing and i think im capable of getting in the top 8 but well see how we go on the day ive got to get through the qualifying round and then anything can happen
3946259 the girls will probably jump at every height up to 4 40m or 4 45m depending on what the qualifying height is and its important to jump at every height and clear it at your first attempt
3946260 a couple of weeks ago in monaco where isinbaeva broke the world record and boyd set a new pb the atmosphere was pretty amazing and the stand wasnt even packed
3946261 we knew that mum was a runner and dad was a pole vaulter but the first time we ever really saw some footage of them was a few months ago before that wed only seen snippets or clips we grew up knowing that mum and dad went to the olympics and that was pretty special but they were still just mum and dad
3946262 ive heard stories about them and the rendinas travelling together and some of their other friends are people they went to the olympics with but i think they want me to experience it for myself and figure it out as i go along
3946263 we have our moments though they are mostly me you can probably say things to your dad that you wouldnt say to a coach normally and i dont think ill ever be able to separate him as just the coach on the track because he is my dad but he knows exactly what he is talking about and i trust him completely so in that respect it is a normal athlete coach relationship i couldnt trust anyone more i know he has my best interests at heart and is always trying to figure out how we can fix things to make me jump better
3946264 one thing he does at the moment and in an interview it wont be that effective is that when he wants me to be strong on takeoff he does this bicep curl type of move and then a take off with his hand if anyone gets it on film they are going to wonder what he is doing take note channel 7 we would like to see this on the coverage he did it the first time in salamanca and i knew exactly what he meant but was just like what the there are a few others that he uses for last minute things like rock back and whatever but so do the other athletes and coaches so its quite normal
3946265 culture la biblioth que num rique europ enne ouvrira ses portes lautomne
3946266 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
3946267 i do not undertake to promote welfare for i propose to extend freedom my aim is not to pass laws but to repeal them it is not to inaugurate new programs but to cancel old ones that do violence to the constitution
3946268 an electromagnetic pulse emp attack on the american homeland said one of the distinguished scientists who testified at the hearing is one of only a few ways that the united states could be defeated by its enemies terrorist or otherwise
3946269 and it is probably the easiest a single scud missile carrying a single nuclear weapon detonated at the appropriate altitude would interact with the earths atmosphere producing an electromagnetic pulse radiating down to the surface at the speed of light depending on the location and size of the blast the effect would be to knock out already stressed power grids and other electrical systems across much or even all of the continental united states for months if not years
3946270 we trust that the philippine senate be proactive in protecting the filipino people and the environment from chemical trespassing through toxic waste trade
3946271 unambiguous indicator that trade in toxic wastes is promoted under the pact
3946272 its kinda like a meth addict thats addicted to meth a lot of times theyll do about anything to be able to get their product to satisfy their habit
3946273 bob me dijo hoy que manny ha rechazado aceptar los t rminos
3946274 tuve una buena conversaci n con bob nosotros seguirmeos con nuestras cosas y creo que manny har lo mismo con las suyas
3946275 de los tres puntos m s problem ticos se puede decir que oscar baj sus demandas en 2 1 2
3946276 richard y yo tuvimos una buena reuni n y resolvimos los dem s asunos
3946277 oscar quer a un 70 30 y richard y yo pensamos que habr a lugar para negociar oscar iba a venir a los angeles esta semana para reunirse con richard en persona pero no pudo y tuvieron que hacerlo por tel fono oscar fue firme en que la divisi n fuera 70 30 o nada richard me dijo eso y yo le transmit lo mismo a pacquiao y su gente en las filipinas ellos me dijeron que no aceptaban el acuerdo y que buscara otra pelea
3946278 pacquiao tiene un consejero y abogado franklin jeng gacal que basicamente se enfoca en porcentajes pero si uno va a comprar un auto o una casa o alimentos paga en porcentaje o en dinero la respuesta es que paga en dinero no en porcentajes espero que esto se le haya explicado correctamente a manny
3946279 richard y yo tuvimos una discusi n muy franca siempre pens que llegar amos a un acuerdo cuando richard regres y me dijo que oscar no quer a bajar su demanda me sorprendi si no hay un movimiento en eso el acuerdo est muerto
3946280 creo que para que haya un acuerdo manny tiene que aflojar y oscar tiene que aflojar
3946281 la pregunta en la mente de un boxeador no es cu nto voy a ganar sino si es justo
3946282 olv dense de la cifra en si ellos tiene que sentir que lo que le est n ofreciendo es justo el acuerdo en el que estabamos trabajando era de mucho dinero para ambos peleadores la pregunta es si era una divisi n justa pens que una cifra entre 30 y 40 por ciento para manny era justa
3946283 para mi es dificil de creer que tendr que pelear tres o cuatro peleas para conseguir lo que hubiera ganado si peleara contra oscar
3946284 espero que manny haya recibido toda la informaci n de su gente
3946285 uno no empieza una negociaci n ofreciendo un 30 por ciento y enseguida toma una firme posici n de que no va a haber lugar para negociar tendr a que haber dicho eso desde el principio no es richard es oscar el dice que manny no deber a recibir m s que floyd mayweather floyd se llev el 30 por ciento manny dice que es m s grande de lo que floyd era en ese momento
3946286 si nos llaman y nos proponen un 35 por ciento har a todo para realizar la pelea
3946287 espero que oscar con todo su dinero y todo lo dem s sea sensible en este asunto
3946288 at some point yes willingham said but when that would be he said he doesnt know
3946289 is still day to day and wouldnt give a timetable for when he will return
3946290 were pleased with where hes at and hes day to day
3946291 i anticipate we will see a lot of guys play there he said one of those could be
3946292 he brings that to the table and thats a great start
3946293 walt has been a very good receiver the entire time he has been a tight end willingham said
3946294 now hes starting to show some signs at being better at all the other responsibilities at tight end and that comes with experience hes starting to know things and understand things he still has some growing to do but i like where he is going
3946295 he has not disappointed willingham said chancellor young for a little while today seeing how his return to football has been going with shaw leaving there is even a greater chance for young to see the field as a receiver
3946296 im just trying to get the rust off he said
3946297 but its not too bad ive got the feeling now like i know what to expect
3946298 we havent really been like just let it go yet because were trying to keep everybody up he said
3946299 is it just me or have the huskies had an abnormally large amount of personnel issues so far with ineligibility and injuries compared to other teams and past years
3946300 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
3946301 kind of like planting like 325 trees or something like that thats what its the equivalent to and over 30 years itll remove like 99 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
3946302 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
3946303 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
3946304 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
3946305 my dads in the air force so we move a lot
3946306 it didnt last long but it was a trip i felt dizzy and everything i touched and heard and smelled was like magnified
3946307 the issue was first brought to my attention by a constituent whose 14 year old daughter tried salvia and came home hysterical
3946308 after doing some research and talking to people who had tried this drug i realized what a problem it was
3946309 its tough for law enforcement to control because drug tests cant pick up any trace of salvia in the bloodstream
3946310 another concern of ours is the brightly colored packaging it comes in its almost like bubble gum and thats part of what attracts the youth but they dont realize how dangerous it really is
3946311 i figured if its intense enough that people are trying to ban it i might as well try it while i can
3946312 its trippy it makes you hear lights and see sounds but after trying it i dont think it should be made illegal
3946313 there are five different levels each with a different color
3946314 i always use level five the blue one called infinity for the strongest effect
3946315 it makes me think about myself in a way id never thought of before
3946316 i felt like i was outside of my body looking in
3946317 i think its safe to say that any substance that causes you to act so irregularly is harmful to the body
3946318 all you have to do is look on youtube for videos of teenagers shocking behavior while using salvia
3946319 honestly i dont buy the excuse that teens use this for meditation or anything like that
3946320 the majority of them just use it as a way to get high
3946321 its like hookah in that young kids just use it to feel like theyre rebelling while still following the rules it makes you feel all giggly and goofy and thats not what im looking for not anymore
3946322 we all know i havent been running the best its been a pretty difficult year and now when it comes to it i have to make a decision its the individual event or the relay when you have five other guys depending on you you cant just make the decision based on yourself
3946323 you have to be up front and honest with the coach on what you can deliver because he is in charge of the relay team and making decisions for them
3946324 homes always a good place to clear your head and make decisions that arent rash so when i was there i decided that i can really contribute to the team whether i run or dont run i can help australia to be successful at this olympics so here i am
3946325 unfortunately when youve won before you know what it takes to be number one and you know how far away you are
3946326 every time ive gotten better this year something else has happened because ive been behind the eight ball i have more to lose by running badly than by staying home i could have taken the easy option and stayed at home but im here
3946327 theres not a lot you can do about the physical stuff at this stage so if you are a positive person and have good energy you can definitely help the other guys to be the best they possibly can whether you run or dont run
3946328 we all know when it comes to a relay that australia can pull something special out having clinton hill mark ormrod and me from athens we know how to work each others psyche so its a good opportunity i dont want to throw away
3946329 america is running the race on their own so really we won the last olympics then theres jamaica and the bahamas with a little bit more horse power than we have after that it goes nigeria japan great britain australia and poland we have the same horse power its just how we maneuver it to get the best out of it
3946330 we all need to pull our weight if we want to win a medal we are working really well together and have good camaraderie clinton is a great leader when it comes to relays and we have two guys with really great horse power in joel and sean really i feel we are in a good position without the pressure of commonwealth games where we were meant to win and we can go in there relaxed but with some expectation on ourselves
3946331 we would both love to be running individually but if the young guys see the confidence we have leading in to it it will help them to shine
3946332 you cant slap fate in the face im here for a reason and it would be wrong for me to throw it away because im not running well individually
3946333 trust me its hard to digest because in my head im number one
3946334 theres nothing like leaving it to the last minute but after nationals it was like ok im in the team with a bit of a relief and obviously a lot of excitement but then knowing that i was on that plane i could really put in some work i just hope that im building to beijing like i did through the domestic season because ive been getting better but im sure there is still more there
3946335 i have a good idea of how i want the competition to go you know over at the first attempt each time and ill need to be consistent but thats what i have been working for and its coming its not quite there yet but its close

3946337 the girls will probably jump at every height up to 4 40m or 4 45m depending on what the qualifying height is and its important to jump at every height and clear it at your first attempt

3946345 i have a zero threshold for insignificant facts i will cut people off if they dont answer my question
3946346 being a state senator where i have a forum to criticize him
3946347 when youre down there at the capitol every day and youre frustrated sure you think about it
3946348 now im home with my wife and kids and my frustration level isnt pegging out at 110 percent
3946349 i lose my temper i cuss im prideful im arrogant i can name 50 sins i commit everyday i wish sometimes i could be more humble i really do
3946350 get changed first then come through to my dressing room
3946351 kame this is really important to me and its taken me a lot of courage to be able to say it so please listen carefully okay
3946352 thats okay i kind of thought so you being gay changes absolutely nothing between us
3946353 im so shocked at the moment i cant think i cant reply to you
3946354 gaki san can you give me half an hour to think about this
3946355 gaki san ive never been confessed to by a girl before heck ive never been confessed to by a guy before
3946356 ive thought about dating girls a few times but each time i thought about it i became scared of myself i had no idea if i was wrong for thinking those things so ive been ignoring it
3946357 but when you confessed to me everything came rushing back ive never had a problem with gays its just that i was unsure about myself ive been thinking over various things like our jobs our future stuff along those lines but i realised that those things were irrelevant it was just about us i dont know if what i feel for you is more than friendship im sorry
3946358 you are a very important person to me and i feel like i need to give us a chance
3946359 ill be your girlfriend for one week after that ill give you my answer is that okay
3946360 this is a part of the world many people are unfamiliar with
3946361 on the sunday night before we left we heard aircraft flying overhead every four or five minutes and bombs being dropped
3946362 but while the medical needs and supplies of georgia are urgent
3946363 these people are displaced and going to need temporary shelter and food and water too
3946364 we need to educate people that this is a region that needs support
3946365 we encourage all of columbia to be sensitive to georgia and help in any way they can
3946366 it now costs 8 500 to ship one container to georgia that price is double what it was in recent years past around 3 500
3946367 i was having severe headaches and by two oclock in the afternoon i just could not think
3946368 at this point we have no good treatment for alzheimers disease the drugs on the market now do nothing to stop the progression of the disease
3946369 and with this new experimental drug hopefully it will help someone else if not me too
3946370 my experience while taking applied music was worthwhile because i could improve my skills in a bevy of instruments including the euphonium
3946371 with obama attracting new people and teens it all trickles down to the youth
3946372 mccain is a white man hes old hes not interesting until you get another candidate like barack obama
3946373 when the campaign was in town we had a huge volunteer base
3946374 on march 4 the texas primary a lot of us took off of school and went to work the polls we helped out a whole bunch id say we had a good 20 to 30 people
3946375 ill be able to help people understand how to vote or who to vote for
3946376 when i do have a chance ill be there as soon as i can
3946377 college loans are getting real high lowering interest rates on college loans would be a really good idea
3946378 i think people are comparing them by appearances we are an appearance based culture
3946379 a lot of people are thinking that mccain looks too old and that he cant identify with their wishes
3946380 he looks a certain way hes someone very attractive to identify with he has a personality thats comparable to a magnet
3946381 you have their web sites with links to other web sites like myspace and facebook
3946382 i think he stands more with the younger generation and we stand with barack on a lot of his values
3946383 besides being too old mccain is out of touch with the youth and the generation gap is there
3946384 i think its a good idea because its very easy to access information
3946385 but it seems a little desperate when obama appeared on mtv asking all these kids questions i thought that was ridiculous they are running for president they need to get to business
3946386 the war has been overshadowed by the economy and gas prices
3946387 one of the biggest things is just knowing why you should care
3946388 you have a lot of other things going on in your life you wonder why you should even care about politics
3946389 me and some of my friends call it the camarad factor
3946390 its not really about what the issues are its who you can feel like youre friends with
3946391 i dont see a lot of issue based voters i see a lot of camarad voters
3946392 on a bad day i get 60 miles to the gallon
3946393 we sold 346 motorcycles and scooters just this past month
3946394 its crazy one of out every five people wants a scooter
3946395 i save about 400 a month since i have switched
3946396 i tore all the skin down from my left knee to my bone
3946397 i have the freedom to go where i want when i want without being dependent on anyone
3946398 heeyy i thought i ordered an 8gb this only says 3g

3946420 while many features from premium bluetooth headsets have trickled down to very common models the two features that remain largely in the upper end are noise canceling and cutting edge industrial design whether or not you want to make a fashion statement the noise canceling is often worth the price of admission its a tough market for high end headsets especially now that the much anticipated aliph jawbone 2 has hit the streets but even though motorolas motopure h12 89 95 has been out for a few months enough design smarts have gone into it to make it worth keeping in consideration for comparison shopping lets consider it now

3946447 as you know over the past several days we have seen that international aggression is tragically not a thing of the past
3946448 some americans when they read this news may wonder where georgia is or why we should care about the conflict between georgians and the russian army its after all a small remote and obscure place but history is often made in remote obscure places and its being made in georgia today
3946449 georgia itself my friends has a long and remarkable history
3946450 and my friends and ill talk about this more in a minute but theyre at a strategic crossroads
3946451 in this country its that little country a country whose territorial integrity independence and sovereignty nato countries reaffirmed at their summit in april terrible violence has occurred now let me just remind you exactly what has taken place here
3946452 on friday russian tanks and troops moved through the roki tunnel across an internationally recognized border and into the georgian province of south ossetia
3946453 the russian government stated it was acting only to protect ossetians and yet on saturday its bombing campaign encompassed the whole of georgia
3946454 before the weekend ended russian troops drove the georgians out of south ossetia and stepped up their offensive in the region of abkhazia abkhazia is another area that the russians have controlled in violation of georgian territorial integrity
3946455 president medvedev stated that he has halted the offensive but reports indicate that russian military forces have continued attacks in some areas and the situation remains fluid and dangerous
3946456 in the face of this threat the leaders of poland estonia lithuania ukraine and latvia you know theres a common thread there amongst them they all suffered under soviet domination theyve all announced that theyll travel to the region and the french president is in moscow in an attempt to help resolve the crisis
3946457 this is the situation in georgia as we meet here this morning
3946458 my friends we learned at great cost the price of allowing aggression against free nations to go unchecked
3946459 my friends today the killing goes on and aggression goes on yet i know from speaking this morning to the president of georgia misha saakashvili who ive known for many years that he knows that the thoughts and the prayers and support of the american people are with that brave little nation as they struggle today for their freedom and independence and he wanted me to say thank you to you to give you his heartfelt thanks for the support of the american people for this tiny little democracy far away from the united states of america and i told him that i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians

3946480 many of these neighborhoods that made these great gains in the 1990s with the downturn in the beginning of this decade and the weak recovery have been hit hard by this economic change
3946481 weve lost a lot of ground and see poverty again increasing in these neighborhoods
3946482 as people try to work their way out of poverty they dont find as many of the opportunities they need in very low income neighborhoods
3946483 concentrated poverty is problematic because theres basically less opportunity for people to really improve their living standards
3946484 but the solution cant just be a matter of moving people out of poor neighborhoods we also have to think about creating opportunities within those neighborhoods

3946490 the last time i was here i watched a television crew shooting baywatch
3946491 of course the producer was correct i was confused i had confabulated the experience of seeing something in a movie with real life supposedly ronald reagan often made this mistake but how can you
3946492 when i was a boy in england long ago people who traveled on trains with dogs had to pay for a dog ticket
3946493 the very same encounter appeared as a cartoon in punch in 1869 the caption of the cartoon reads
3946494 station master say mum as cats is dogs and rabbits is dogs and sos parrots but this ere tortis is a insect so there aint no charge for it
3946495 thanks to nicholas humphrey and michael jackson for letters informing me of the 1869 punch cartoon about tortoises and dogs on trains my memory of traveling with a tortoise has two possible explanations the first and more probable is that i heard of the conversation recorded in the punch cartoon and transformed it over the years into a memory this would not be the first time that i remembered something that never happened memories of childhood recollected in old age are notoriously unreliable the second possible explanation is that the memory is accurate in that case the conductor on the train knew the cartoon and said what he was supposed to say according to the script
3946496 here are several overlapping definitions for confabulation inventing things that arent true making up something thats thought to be true for a variety of reasons one being to fill in memory gaps inventing something thats hoped to be true imagining that something happened to you after hearing a report or reading a story about someone else manufacturing deliberately or not a portion of reality arriving at a fabricated story and just plain lying
3946497 so iran is not a threat thats what regional and even western states have said they say iran is ready for talks dont raise hue and cry against iran oh the worlds liars oh the liar israel oh the liar white house if you wish to attack iran we will give you a response that will make you regretful
3946498 according to the interviews conducted by the new york times the administrations argument that iraq was producing biological weapons was based almost entirely on human intelligence of unknown reliability
3946499 let me say a word about satellite images before i show a couple the photos that i am about to show you are sometimes hard for the average person to interpret hard for me the painstaking work of photo analysis takes experts with years and years of experience poring for hours and hours over light tables but as i show you these images i will try to capture and explain what they mean what they indicate to our imagery specialists lets look at one this one is about a weapons munitions facility a facility that holds ammunition at a place called taji this is one of about 65 such facilities in iraq we know that this one has housed chemical munitions in fact this is where the iraqis recently came up with the additional four chemical weapons shells let me give you a closer look look at the image on the left on the left is a close up of one of the four chemical bunkers the two arrows indicate the presence of sure signs that the bunkers are storing chemical munitions the arrow at the top that says security points to a facility that is a signature item for this kind of bunker inside that facility are special guards and special equipment to monitor any leakage that might come out of the bunker the truck you also see is a signature item its a decontamination vehicle in case something goes wrong this is characteristic of those four bunkers the special security facility and the decontamination vehicle will be in the area if not at any one of them or one of the other it is moving around those four and it moves as needed to move as people are working in the different bunkers

3946520 they need to rely on creative marketing ideas online as much as they always have in other mediums mcgrath said
3946521 instead theyre blasting the clients message whether its appropriate or not

3946527 we stood up well because we were so young in the middle of the park
3946528 of course for a game of that level you could be worried but i have confidence in them and i must say i have been paid back very well
3946529 we expected a difficult game and we were not disappointed they man marked us all over the pitch and we needed to be patient and not make any mistakes at the back
3946530 we changed a bit tactically at half time but most important they dropped their level a bit to do what they did in the first half to tackle for every ball is of course very difficult and from then on we looked a bit more comfortable
3946531 its a massive mountain to climb its bigger than everest but we take heart from the performance
3946532 i said before that this game isnt just about now but also the future i like what i see of this team we showed we are a good team who can compete with the likes of
3946533 we go away thinking 2 0 is an unbelievable result because of the performance we put in
3946534 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half
3946535 theyre always expecting some terrible person to turn up so you try to make sure that they know that youre intelligent and not horrible then you try to be rugged and sexy but only after smart and lovable

3946538 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
3946539 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3946540 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3946541 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
3946542 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3946543 nothing can justify such an attack on people whose lives are devoted to helping the people of afghanistan
3946544 humanitarian workers should be protected by the principles of neutrality and impartiality and must not be targeted as they appear to be at present in afghanistan
3946545 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3946546 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001

3946555 the board has accepted the resignation of paul battershill effective immediately as a result of a loss of confidence in his leadership of the police department
3946556 we felt that under the circumstances the 15 000 cost for his legal fees was appropriate
3946557 its now up to the office of the police complaints commissioner to review the findings and determine if a public hearing is warranted
3946558 the process with the police act is still under way

3946563 ive discussed that with the government and the private health insurers one of the concerns ive flagged is that when the surcharge came in it wasnt indexed for inflation
3946564 if the government is going to collect 3 1 billion over the next four years spending 53 million on prevention programs doesnt cut it for me
3946565 its not just in south australias interest its in the national interest not to let an ecosystem die not to allow one of the most water efficient food bowls in the country the riverland to wither and perish because we havent got our act together
3946566 the alp has been absolutely gutless not to field a candidate in the seat
3946567 its totally disingenuous to say the alp doesnt have the resources to run or doesnt have money to waste if that is the case why would they ever run at a general election
3946568 sure the price is a big number and when we look at it we think gee they have made a poultice but at the same time they are saying to me why are you being so miserly you know the value you know the synergies

3946578 my concerns are that people in australian workplaces are treated decently
3946579 i certainly have said in relation to telstra that work choices is a thing of australias past not its future
3946580 the workplace ombudsman will certainly respond if a complaint is made the workplace ombudsman has looked at some matters in relation to telstra in the past when complaints have been made i would note that the workplace ombudsman would assist any australian worker who believes they need that assistance generally i would say to telstra and i would say to all australian companies we want to see cooperative industrial relations
3946581 the leaked documents show the company is determined to defy the rudd government on its industrial relations policy
3946582 the documents show telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer

3946610 only the use of information about fibre and sugars did not decline over the 10 year period use of fibre information increased by 2 percentage points while that for sugars held steady
3946611 this increase in use of fibre may be the result of the increasing popularity of low carb diets interest in identifying whole grain foods or an aging population that is more aware of dietary fibres health benefits

3946707 conditions within rural and regional australia remain generally better than 12 months ago and agricultural markets remain strong futuris said
3946708 although higher interest and lower income from aaco impacted our overall result the year featured strong performances from our elders rural services elders rural bank and automotive operations mr wozniczka said
3946709 elders rural services recorded the greatest improvement achieving its best ever result in lifting underlying ebit from 49 1 million to 60 7 million
3946710 excellent banking results offsetting softer insurance markets and the return of claims ratios to customary levels
3946711 we face a tough market in the year ahead but we are well placed to withstand these conditions with a proven business model clear strategy and sound property skills managing director matthew quinn said
3946712 we are budgeting for a nominal increase in earnings per security in financial year 2009 but it is going to be tough and we are assuming that market conditions do not deteriorate further
3946713 looking through the current cycle we expect to achieve higher earnings per security growth from financial year 2010 onwards
3946714 we have seen a steep decline in confidence in the australian reit real estate investment trust sector in recent months and were disappointed to have been impacted he said
3946715 we are intent on restoring confidence through our focus on value creation for our security holders and our sound balance sheet puts us in a good position to do so
3946716 our residential business also performed well despite deteriorating buyer sentiment and our ability to once again grow profits through a tough residential cycle demonstrates the quality and diversity of our business said mr quinn
3946717 active asset management and low occupancy costs should enable us to deliver further operational upside despite the recent slowdown in consumer spending mr quinn said
3946718 we remain of the view that the medium term prospects for the australian residential market are favourable due to high immigration and significant supply constraints mr quinn said
3946719 results on the asx are okay this morning and if companies meet expectations the market will give them the benefit of the doubt at least for the time being

3946732 we were not surprised by the fine performance of the liege side we had seen enough of them to know they were a good aggressive side
3946733 the real surprise for me was the way liverpool played the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
3946734 we will have to be a lot better in the second leg at anfield much better
3946735 we have been playing well in pre season looking confident and passing the ball well
3946736 but we did not do any of those things i did not want to bring steven gerrard on because the doctors had told me he was not fit enough to start the match
3946737 we waited until well into the second half before using him but we were not controlling the game and i had to bring him on
3946738 this game was far more difficult than we expected and jose reina was the man of the match
3946739 we know we can always rely on pepe to stop penalties but we have been told that the other effort may have been behind the line but these things happen
3946740 liverpool maybe came here asleep and not expecting this sort of game
3946741 maybe though we have woken them up for the second leg which will me much harder for us
3946742 we felt that if we did not lose this first leg we would still be in with a chance

3946796 streetcar is definitely going to create a reason for young people to come downtown
3946797 thats very evident in places like san francisco which never got rid of its streetcar system
3946798 it looks like its going to take you somewhere but its only designed to support downtown residents
3946799 if officials fall for the hype and dont ask the hard questions voters should vote them out
3946800 one happy consequence will be that streetcar customers who live in the area will be less mobile by choice
3946801 in years gone by people would move to cities to get a job

3946808 theres a select few players out there that drive in runs every day every other day those guys are top of the line players batting average home runs i dont pay attention to those things that much if you have a good on base percentage and are driving in runs youre doing your job

3946815 the government has directed tcca to rectify its oversight on the industry particularly in the operations area because most of the accidents are attributed to human error
3946816 aviation safety is a major concern to the government and indeed in the whole of the east africa and africa in general

3946820 there is no need for calling a strike because the government has already paid new salaries in july and is working towards establishing the correct amount of arrears owed to any of its workers
3946821 we are surprised and do not understand the basis for which they are organising the protest the government is not late anyhow and we are aiming at clearing the money owed between august and september
3946822 as part of a wider process of transformation of consciousness within the private and public sectors epsl programme will develop public service leaders who are flexible and principled
3946823 a small number of ceos of private companies will also participate in the programme
3946824 the outcomes of the programme should include the promotion of a public private partnership which harbours a spirit of collaboration and transformation of the way the government does business advances the economy and enhances the lives of the citizens
3946825 although we are only at the beginning of a long journey of discovery and there is still a lot of work that lies ahead of us i am very excited that we have come to this stage and i look forward to an eventful week
3946826 we in the government are pleased with progress that we have made together so far and are looking forward to being able to face the leadership challenges posed by rapid change around the world and globalisation with even greater confidence and knowledge as a result of epsl
3946827 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action

3946831 we ask the minister to tell the house what steps has the government taken in its plan to revamp general tyre co kilimanjaro machine tools co tanzania bag corporation in moshi and tanganyika packers of dar es salaam
3946832 the opposition camp wants the government to tell tanzanians what general tyre co was producing before it was privatised and the current production status
3946833 we would want to know what is really happening to what was once the best industry in east africa that its discouraging situation since then
3946834 since it was privatised the company has never been as promising at it was before privatisation
3946835 the opposition camp would like to know why a private company despite having fewer shares has been left to take hold of the top management
3946836 we are here to serve notice on the so called nuclear renaissance that the anti nuclear movement is alive and well

3946840 john mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption shows how far he is willing to go to win
3946841 despite all of his rhetoric about reform mccains willingness to accept money raised by tainted abramoff cronies like ralph reed shows that mccain simply cannot be trusted to bring change to washington politics
3946842 john mccain says he takes the high road and then he comes to atlanta and chows down on shrimp cocktail with an unindicted co conspirator
3946843 senator mccain knows exactly how ralph reed helped jack abramoff defraud indian tribes out of tens of millions of dollars
3946844 senator mccain should spare himself any further embarrassment by canceling this event immediately
3946845 raises serious questions about why he mccain didnt bring ralph reed before his committee was he concerned it would undercut his presidential campaign now you see ralph reed raising money for his campaign
3946846 ralph reed is not part of our fund raising organization in the state of georgia nor is he part of this event
3946847 i take the long view of politics which is that yesterdays opponent can be tomorrows friend or ally
3946848 i have found this to be the case with senator mccain i am supporting him because he is running on principled conservative positions on taxes judges terrorism energy values and the family i hold no position title or official role in the mccain campaign and am not seeking one
3946849 i was very intrigued when i heard reports that ralph reed was actively fund raising for mccain
3946850 i was curious as to whether or not senator mccain knew that ralph reed was actively fund raising for him

3946862 we have been advised that the project did not meet conditions set by the new government
3946863 the anzac peace park will now proceed as a 2 million project instead of the 2 5 million originally planned
3946864 because of the rejection we will not be able to build the memory wall and the larger interpretive elements that are a key part of the project
3946865 we will proceed with the seawall and reclamation stormwater filtration beds and general landscaping
3946866 with the approach of the anzac fleet departure centenary in 2014 and the anzac day centenary in 2015 we would hope to complete this nationally significant park in the next couple of years
3946867 this new station will provide a base from which the two permanent walpole police officers can ensure that the community visitors and those who travel through can enjoy an added sense of safety and security
3946868 thats because 20 per cent of saap clients are aged between 15 and 24 and the number of young people sleeping rough has doubled over the last 10 years
3946869 dropping out of study and finding it harder to get a job are just two of the harsh realities encountered by a young person who finds themselves homeless
3946870 in the current rental market where demand is outstripping supply young people are particularly vulnerable and disadvantaged
3946871 only now during the election campaign has labor back flipped on their previous approach and promised to build a new hospital in two stages by 2015
3946872 the people of albany and the great southern have every right to be cynical about labors election pledge and they have every right to expect a state of the art hospital within four years instead of labors eight years
3946873 in politics you set off with your intention with what you think is the right plan
3946874 if a better proposal comes up youve got to be prepared to listen to look at what can be done and to change to alter thats what weve done this is a great victory for the local community

3946878 it is classified as a liberal seat under the redistribution
3946879 its a challenge i love challenges we cant relax we have a great leader and great policies
3946880 a lot of those people in that electorate have been coming to me as their local member anyway but they couldnt vote for me
3946881 hopefully i have looked after them well enough that they will consider my vote
3946882 new hospital new entertainment centre new foreshore development these are all things happening because there is a labor government
3946883 i believe that if we dont win albany with what we have done here what we are doing here and what we plan to do here and with the quality of the local representative then we will struggle to win the election
3946884 if you can get a really good working environment if everything is fresh and new and theres more space then people are going to be happy
3946885 ive done an inquiry into sports facilities and advised the government there needs to be much more money in the csrff for regional areas
3946886 it is a lot to do with sporting clubs to get out there and apply for it
3946887 we could be the first regional centre to have renewable energy and we could also be selling some of it off
3946888 with the wind farm and wave energy its something we can do now with the wind and the waves down here were in a magnificent position
3946889 the state government has leased the land to carnegie corporation
3946890 albany has a solid record on recycling and is well on the path to doing more
3946891 it is great to see a system that allows residents and visitors to continue their recycling efforts in public places keeping our city clean and reducing the amount of waste going to landfill
3946892 beach users have really embraced the new bin system and as a result litter is down and recycling is up
3946893 so far 288 000 kilograms of bottles and cans have been collected from middleton beach over a period of almost a year materials which would have previously gone to landfill
3946894 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3946895 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3946896 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3946897 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3946898 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3946899 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3946900 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3946901 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3946902 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3946903 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3946904 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3946905 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3946906 wouldnt be a bad thing because she has a lot of money
3946907 how could god make such a faux pas putting the orange cliffs next to pink flowers
3946908 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3946909 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3946910 how much do you want how much for me to fuck you
3946911 until i hear anything else thats the way im looking at it right now
3946912 im focusing on football until i hear anything else ill assume its over
3946913 no matter what anybody says theres going to be people who automatically assume guilty until proven innocent which is sort of a tough pill to swallow
3946914 now that its over or seems to be over im trying to move on past it
3946915 there may be some differences of opinion on some issues on major issues such as iran and also the middle east
3946916 but when it comes to anti semitism i think were on the same page
3946917 we mentioned our concerns about anti semitism and asked him what his position was

3946935 of course we would be concerned about it and we have actually only learned about it actually through media reports
3946936 so all i can say to you is our position is clear and that is that the media must be free to report on the olympic games
3946937 we are in the process of endeavouring to get all the facts and if necessary we will raise our concerns with the appropriate authority
3946938 we had a struggle about two weeks ago when it was apparent that the technology was moving slowly and that there was restriction on certain sites on the internet which as a result of inquiries and clarification were freed up
3946939 and i am in the main press centre every day and i have to tell you that the feedback i get from the media is generally the working conditions are excellent

3946954 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3946955 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
3946956 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3946957 nothing can justify such an attack on people whose lives are devoted to helping the people of afghanistan
3946958 humanitarian workers should be protected by the principles of neutrality and impartiality and must not be targeted as they appear to be at present in afghanistan
3946959 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible

3946998 i have as is normal practice in any sensitive case obtained the views of the prime minister and the foreign and defence secretaries as to the public interest considerations raised by this investigation they have expressed the clear view that continuation of the investigation would cause serious damage to uk saudi security intelligence and diplomatic cooperation which is likely to have seriously negative consequences for the uk public interest in terms of both national security and our highest priority foreign policy objectives in the middle east the heads of our security and intelligence agencies and hm ambassador to saudi arabia share this assessment

3947000 under the terms of the signed document typhoon aircraft will replace tornado air defence variant aircraft and others currently in service with the rsaf the details of these arrangements are confidential between the two governments
3947001 the saudis are understood to have ordered a total of 72 eurofighters to replace older aircraft including tornado jets bought in the 1980s and 1990s from bae under the al yamamah arms for oil deal the eurofighter order in effect amounts to the third phase of the al yamamah programme and marks the first time the aircraft has been bought by any country outside europe the deal includes a full package of training through life support spares and technology transfer which will at least double the value of the deal and perhaps increase its value by 150 per cent
3947002 as per the 1986 mou the uk mod will continue for project salam to ensure that all equipment spares training and technical work supplied by the main contractor bae systems are in accordance with saudi requirements
3947003 the governments share key objectives on national security and actions to combat global terrorism

3947005 the mod documents reveal that the price of each tornado was inflated by 32 from gbp 16 3m to gbp 21 5m it is common in arms deals for the prices of weapons to be raised so that commissions can be skimmed off the top the gbp 600m involved is the same amount that it was alleged at the time in arab publications was exacted in secret commissions paid to saudi royals and their circle of intermediaries in london and riyadh as the price of the deal

3947064 la recomendaci n es que intentes ver el gran beneficio que te puede producir subir y bajar escaleras donde quiera que te encuentres o donde transites
3947065 growing from humble beginnings on the streets of san francisco to a lifestyle brand in a few short years is remarkable each year we strive to build on the success of previous icer air events and were very excited about future plans for a multi city esurance icer air tour starting in 2009
3947066 esurance is again thrilled to be the title sponsor of such a great event our partnership with icer air has produced some great results and were proud to help make such a signature event possible
3947067 were very excited about the evolution of the event and the upcoming tour because esurance is committed to helping our large sponsorships get even greener were also very enthusiastic about the green aspects of esurance icer air 2008

3947070 many of the previous studies in this field were computational
3947071 however the computational nanotube models that have been used never really directly corresponded to any experiments the nanotubes we tested however could be characterized well in terms of number of shells diameter chirality etc we were able to do a direct comparison of our experimental results with nanotube models that represented them accurately this let us solve the problem of the validity of certain computational methods for these types of systems we hope this will be useful for many researchers in the future
3947072 measurements of near ultimate strength for multiwalled carbon nanotubes and irradiation induced crosslinking improvements
3947073 the most significant result that we achieved was experimental measurements that agree with quantum mechanics predictions
3947074 this includes youngs modulus failure stress and failure strain of a single shell of a carbon nanotube they came out to be about 1 tpa 100 gpa and 11 respectively these numbers come extremely close to theoretically predicted values and our tests showed remarkable consistency this consistency in our measurements is a first for researchers studying the mechanical properties of nanotubes
3947075 in order to really isolate and understand the mechanism at work though we needed first to have some baseline single shell tests using the aforementioned capabilities using this method we could study irradiation in a way that gave trustworthy results this was our motivation for all of our work our lab has developed the proper tools for this type of nanoscale testing in order to resolve experimental inconsistencies which in turn will aid the design of nanodevices and nanomaterials for their mainstream introduction in the market
3947076 there are still a number of problems associated with using nanoscale structures like nanotubes
3947077 among them are problems like manipulation dispersion and uniformity of samples in essence these are all issues of control controlling objects only 10 nanometers wide is difficult and it has held back a lot of the potential applications this is a very active field of research though and solutions to these problems are being pursued by many very talented scientists
3947078 i want to go see my parents my moms here
3947079 america is no longer what it could be what it once was and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children
3947080 i could not identify them as hostile until they bent down and picked up their weapons
3947081 this was decisive because from that moment on the enemy was on the defensive and no longer on the offensive
3947082 a m nunca me mir mal ni me puso la mano encima

3947088 these devices simply cannot generate enough hydrogen or oxygen to amount to a hill of beans a 12 volt car battery might create some bubbles but beyond that a standard car battery isnt powerful enough to do anything

3947118 well shoot anyone who gets in our way including americans
3947119 scarred on mtv a few years ago i fell while rollerblading and my arm looked like something off that show its still kinda crooked to this day
3947120 i think our offense came out and picked up where they left off in the last scrimmage
3947121 they took it to the defense early however the defense settled into the game and finished strongly
3947122 they came up with some big stops at the end they stopped a key fourth down conversion with the game on the line and then stopped the offense in two minute the key for us is we still have a lot of young guys who we are trying to evaluate on the defensive line and at linebacker we have to keep evaluating them and see who can step up
3947123 the backs did a good job and ran hard patrick jackson and daniel continue to make plays they made guys miss and broke tackles its important that we get a lot of production out of them this year
3947124 in the passing game we had some pretty typical freshman mistakes from some of our receivers out there
3947125 usually freshmen come out and look good early but then the more you install and the harder camp gets they seem to hit a wall i think you saw that tonight we had a lot of drops and mental errors
3947126 i thought taylor did a nice job of making some plays he did a good job of getting out of trouble and getting the football downfield were still not getting as many big plays as we will need during the season you can credit the coverage for some of that but our young wide receivers have to learn how to get off the press and get open
3947127 the institution of marriage will be weakened resulting in negative consequences for both adults and children
3947128 traditional marriage is essential to society as a whole and especially to its children
3947129 abortion has taken the lives of over 45 million innocents
3947130 the churchs opposition to same sex marriage neither constitutes nor condones any kind of hostility towards homosexual men and women protecting marriage between a man and a woman does not affect church members christian obligations of love kindness and humanity toward all people
3947131 only a man and a woman together have the natural biological capacity to conceive children
3947132 legally protected because only a male and female together can create new life and because the rearing of children requires a life long commitment which marriage is intended to provide
3947133 marriage and family are vital instruments for rearing children and teaching them to become responsible adults
3947134 by definition all same sex unions are infertile and two individuals of the same gender whatever their affections can never form a marriage devoted to raising their own mutual offspring
3947135 extensive studies have shown that in general a husband and wife united in a loving committed marriage provide the optimal environment for children to be protected nurtured and raised
3947136 in an ideal society every child would be raised by both a father and a mother
3947137 the substantial personal resources that two parents can bring to bear on raising a child
3947138 the all important question of public policy must be what environment is best for the child and for the rising generation
3947139 the staffs superior dedication is at the heart of the companys success
3947140 buying product through the internet or from catalogs is the same as buying sight unseen how can anyone possibly negotiate the correct price of a product without seeing and touching it to determine both quality and product value
3947141 well equipped recreation rooms are becoming a more popular destination for both relatives and friends
3947142 jugamos un gran primer tiempo y fuimos justos ganadores adem s aunque arsenal tuvo un poco m s la pelota en la segunda parte nosotros seguimos buscando tuvimos varias chances y en el final logramos un gol que fue muy importante para la definici n de esta copa
3947143 es una victoria importante porque la logramos ante un rival complicado que por algo gan la sudamericana tambi n en jap n y empez ganando 3 0 el torneo local creo que vamos por el buen camino
3947144 estamos muy bien en todo sentido tanto con la pelota como en lo f sico el trabajo que hicimos de pretemporada fue muy bueno y lo vamos a ir demostrando con el correr de los partidos
3947145 nos estamos equivocando poco hoy en el nico pase que nos sali mal lleg el gol de ellos pero despu s no sufrimos mucho m s en defensa
3947146 youre romo like in your efficiency and big play capability
3947147 i find it to be a refreshing piece of work from dan a northern virginia based boys fan we are united in our hate for the washington redskins be sure to check it out
3947148 eagles fans who want to spy on the enemy should check it out
3947149 dude great site its good to see some knowledgeable fans
3947150 even throughout the dry period that has been this year leading up to the draft youre constantly finding gems to keep us entertained the landryhat has been my homepage for the last 3 months and its earned the spot for a long time to come keep it up and thanks
3947151 i come to this site everyday and at least 15 times a day i really do love your work and completely appreciate all the time you put in this web site

3947154 the couple tied the knot in a simple low key ceremony in las vegas last week whilst holidaying in america
3947155 their marriage has the full support of their family and friends
3947156 we just felt that song represented the album the best
3947157 we werent foolish we knew if we came to the label and suggested that song as a single then there would be editing so there are two versions the album version and the radio edit which is about four minutes long and starts when the singing starts
3947158 i knew i was going to use it for something and then i started making a bed of drones and writing around that i have a feeling that will be one of the more polarising tracks on the album
3947159 but then people say stuff and im like oh wow should i be pressured
3947160 they had such a fabulous time that we got the invite over
3947161 i have a couple of writer friends who were quite inspired by his trailblazing with his shows and writing for the playboy magazine in that respect i have a new found respect for him here i was thinking it was all smut and grotto antics
3947162 i am so used to being down at the ocean i dont even have any proper gear for the snow
3947163 i wish jack was on every one of my records but you cant really ask someone to play over and over on every album it is about timing with ben harper it just happened to be that he was in la when we were making the album
3947164 whenever there is a day off i head to the beach on show days i might be a little late cause the waves are good
3947165 i get a call like where are you yeezy try to hit you with a oeur de whopee till i get flashed by the paparazzi damn these s got me
3947166 i know its been a while sweetheart we hard ly talk i was doing my thing i know i was
3947167 if somebody wouldve told me a year ago itd go get this difficult feeling like katrina with no fema like martin with no gina like a flight with no visa
3947168 but i never thought that you would take it this far what do i know
3947169 you dont have to be the strong african queen all the time sometimes all you have to do is show some weakness dammit show at least a chip in your armor
3947170 if i cant have love and dedication i might as well try to get material shit out of you
3947171 like most poor people in the united states i have no voice

3947180 karena memang ternyata kita masih butuh tenaga ini namun mengenai berapa rincian yang kita butuhkan untuk masing masing tenaga kesehatan dan umum ini saya tidak bisa mengingatnya secara persis tapi yang pasti jumlahnya tahun ini sebanyak itu
3947181 untuk penerimaan formasi 2008 kapan pelaksanaannya kita masih menunggu petunjuk
3947182 untuk 2009 kita harap ada penambahan karena 2009 setelah ada pemekaran tentu kita membutuhkan tenga yang lebih banyak
3947183 kalau menurut informasi yang kami terima dari pusat untuk penerimaan cpns tahun 2008 nanti juga yang diterima sama seperti formasi 2007 lalu yakni paling banyak untuk tenaga guru

3947190 ive been in the real estate market for 24 years and this is the worse ive ever seen it
3947191 just about everyone i talk to is going to vote for him
3947192 they are becoming much more targeted in what they do and the chances of getting a letter or phone call are becoming much much higher
3947193 if you are aware the issues and can deal with them before the tax office gets to you obviously you are going to be a lot better off
3947194 he was a great philanthropist giving an enormous amount of his wealth back to the community through a great number of charities
3947195 mr ilhan was also a great promoter of victoria and in particular melbournes north western suburbs and it is fitting that this recreation reserve which is used by so many young people and families every day is named in his honour
3947196 we are seeing examples of parties acting in the marketplace writing fraudulent valuation reports which are being presented to lenders in a desperate attempt to secure mortgage funds
3947197 it is essential for parties relying on valuations to ensure that proper processes are followed to ensure that the valuation is authentic our clients would generally be able to recognise whether something looks doctored or manufactured by unauthorised parties
3947198 however this could always vary with the level of sophistication of the author or the experience of the party relying on the valuation
3947199 u s credibility is on the line as the bush administration stumbles to respond to the russian invasion of georgia so far the administration has been missing in action
3947200 senior u s officials and i have spoken with the parties and continue to work with them to seek an end to hostilities the united states is working actively with its european partners to launch international mediation we urgently seek russias support of these efforts
3947201 this situation can be resolved peacefully weve been in contact with leaders in both georgia and russia at all levels of government georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august the 6th
3947202 i said this violence is unacceptable i not only said it to vladimir putin ive said it to the president of the country dmitriy medvedev and my administration has been engaged with both sides in this trying to get a cease fire and saying that the status quo ante for all troops should be august 6th and look i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3947203 given its sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies and excellent progress in transition to a market economy georgia is well placed to weather the current crisis georgias economy has been one of the strongest in the region owing to its proven record of reforms and this reform effort deserves continued international support the united states has strongly supported georgias reform and economic development programs and is prepared to join other countries to support the international financial institutions future engagement to promote a vibrant economy that builds on the existing foundations
3947204 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russians relations russias relations with the united states and europe it is time for russia to be true to its word and to act to end this crisis
3947205 i want to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people we are reviewing our options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop we will continue to work diplomatically on this matter and will continue our discussions with all the parties involved
3947206 w ere concentrating right now on getting this conflict stopped so that people can stop dying on getting the russians to stop their bombardment of georgian infrastructure and even georgian ports and towns like gori we are concentrating on the humanitarian assistance that georgia will need were concentrating on getting an assessment of what georgia will need in terms of reconstruction and in sending very strong signals of support to democratically elected government of georgia and its people
3947207 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3947208 no specific legal or clinical guidelines have been established regarding the assessment of competence to waive miranda rights in retarded people
3947209 i see people in movies popping open their laptops and getting online wherever they happen to be it looks awfully easy why do i need a book
3947210 we believe in giving the children absolute freedom to think
3947211 in isha we dont influence the children to think in a particular pattern we want each child to think and understand in his own unique way
3947212 i used to attend the nature trips and summer camps which isha conducts every year with my parents it helped me become more close and sensitive towards nature i am bolder now
3947213 she always has to be doing something useful she is always looking for something to do
3947214 our hod sent a few of us from our department to attend an interview for the post of a drama teacher at the helen o grady drama academy
3947215 the main aim of our syllabus is to bring the child out of his cocoon and overcome his shyness the transformation that just a few classes can do is marvelous
3947216 isha is not a cult or a religion isha teaches you how to become a spiritual being and you learn this through yoga and meditation
3947217 twice before i have experienced out of body moments and i am looking forward to having more such experiences in the future but until then i am very happy with my editing and photography classes
3947218 chemistry and football my two most favorite things in the whole world
3947219 mr durairaj our new coach was simply remarkable it was only after his coaching that our school team saw the regionals although we lost it was still a start i was in the 6th then too young to play but i used to stand under the hot sun after school hours watching my seniors at play i was fascinated by the game
3947220 it was only during my 9th that i finally got a chance to play football under coach durairaj
3947221 during our regular games hour we werent allowed to play football but after the final school bell we would all rush to the field to practice with mr durairaj
3947222 we would lose thats no surprise but once when we won that really boosted our confidence
3947223 ashish was one of our teams forward players i hadnt made it to the team yet but i used to watch him play during our practice matches i loved his style and i used to continuously watch him hoping to pick something from him
3947224 i was nervous and i had a lot of pressure on me the score was 1 1 and the clock was ticking as the match neared its end i pulled off a header shot the ball went straight for the goal the ball slipped out of the goal keepers hand and we won the match
3947225 i still thank my lucky stars for giving me that opportunity it was that match that got me into our states football team
3947226 my parents have always been supportive of me they were overjoyed when i made to the team both in school and at the state level my farther being an army man always instilled discipline in me and in my two elder brothers i think that really helped me in football
3947227 i knew that extra effort wouldnt be a waste my hard work paid i got into the team my parents were proud thats what mattered
3947228 and thats because of my higher secondary teacher mrs malathi she made chemistry so easy and she made it seem so effortless it was not long before chemical bonds and equations became my best buddies i hope i can do my masters i am looking at universities abroad
3947229 i will always love football and it will always be a part of my life but its not for my career i need to build a career on something hard rock solid dependable thats why i chose bio chem
3947230 it is not that difficult you know i know where my priorities are and i work accordingly for instance if i am on the field then i forget about equations and reactions and focus on chasing the ball but if i am in the lab well imagine what would happen to our lab if i loose my concentration and start day dreaming
3947231 on our first practice match the very sight of the other experienced and senior players intimidated me i was scared and afraid i kept asking myself am i good enough can i do it
3947232 before a match i always watch a football game from home i watch the players and their moves and i see if i can implement them in my play
3947233 man u is a very strong team its no wonder that they do so well
3947234 for a couple of weeks i was literally impaired i felt like an invalid when i finally got back on to the field i was goal keeper it didnt bother me i was glad i was near the ball it took 7 long months for my ankle to heal and for me to be able to play my game
3947235 those once good players began slacking in their performance they couldnt run for a long stretch theyd start panting their smoking and drinking habits reduced their stamina
3947236 i am excited about the up coming matches we will be assigned posts on the team and we will discuss new game plans i just cant wait to get my new jersey
3947237 i like our hostel and the boys id be lost without them my friends mean a lot to me
3947238 life would be a sure lot boring without this funny down to earth guy we are all glad he is still sticking around

3947241 the measure of a civilization is how it treats its weakest members
3947242 dad my world has come crashing down i am bankrupt
3947243 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3947244 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
3947245 refuses to pay plaintiffs at the correct royalty rate for its digital exploitation of the capricorn masters
3947246 the audience is every four years for the olympics or when lance armstrong was winning the tours thats american cycling so i hope that winning a gold medal will bring the fans out for more than just one day every four years
3947247 we both come from a triathlon background we both have the same mentality
3947248 and what lance has done for the sport hes done wonderful things and hes also done wonderful things for the cancer foundation and i hope to follow in his footsteps and be that sort of role model for our country and up and coming riders

3947352 they were driving in a land cruiser with a clear irc logo on it
3947353 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3947354 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
3947355 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3947356 nothing can justify such an attack on people whose lives are devoted to helping the people of afghanistan
3947357 humanitarian workers should be protected by the principles of neutrality and impartiality and must not be targeted as they appear to be at present in afghanistan
3947358 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible

3947367 ayesha siddiqa said that behind the us support for certain elements of the pakistani society was its specious perception of modernity
3947368 ayesha siddiqa debunked the argument that pakistan economy has always been in better health under military dictators she explained how pakistan had to pay a heavy price at the end of every military rule
3947369 that the sham stability under general ayub khan in 1960s ended with the breaking up of pakistan zias period of stability gave pakistan the jihadi culture and now the high economic performance era of musharrafs rule has given pakistan gaping fault line in the society between its secular and conservative elements
3947370 ayesha siddiqa rebuked educated pakistanis who look down upon the masses call them illiterate and accuse them of being subservient to authority
3947371 ayesha siddiqa was still excited by the election results because i as an ordinary pakistan can say that we are not a failed state the civil society is alive these elections tell us that we are as ordinary or extraordinary as anybody else
3947372 she impressed upon the audience that pakistan was far from being a failed state it had an active civil society analyzing the recent elections she said people did not just vote against musharraf through voting against pml q pakistanis also rejected other symbols of authoritarianism
3947373 she said the army can be kept out of politics if the civil governments negotiate with the army on militarys economic interests ayesha siddiqas expectation from the pakistan army was that of a professional force which would not interfere in politics just sit back relax play golf and not get into politics was her advice to the pakistan military
3947374 before the development of modern critical care the diagnosis of death was relatively straightforward patients were dead when they were cold blue and stiff unfortunately organs from these traditional cadavers cannot be used for transplantation

3947385 canada remains steadfast in our commitment to the people of afghanistan and will continue to work with the afghan government and the international community to improve the lives of afghans
3947386 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent

3947506 funding costs for the banks across all sources had probably fallen by about 25 to 30 basis points in recent weeks he told a federal parliamentary committee hearing in sydney
3947507 people have been pushing the banks to give more commitment to the fact that they would follow the reserve bank when the reserve bank cuts interest rates
3947508 the banks have responded to that quite cautiously and have been quite non committal
3947509 my guess is really whats happening here is the banks are saying well its unreasonable for them to give commitments when they dont know when the rba is going to move or by how much
3947510 thats why we now find we are in a position to cut interest rates mr battellino added
3947511 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late mr battellino said
3947512 overall when we look at all the evidence which we have its reasonable to conclude that the australian financial sector is competitive and that it stacks up quite well across a range of international benchmarks
3947513 our view is that these recent events are cyclical in nature and do not represent permanent change to the structure of the market in the sense that when markets settle we expect securitisation to pick up again mr battellino said
3947514 i see no reason why the court shouldnt act in accordance with the wishes of the parties judge emmett said
3947515 it was a public road and the toll was put on it by the previous coalition government
3947516 we did commit in 1995 to remove the toll the contract prevented us from doing that without massive payment from the taxpayers so we introduced cashback
3947517 in 2010 the concession period ends and the toll is scheduled to come off
3947518 when we look at bank profitability we find that australian banks are around the top of the international range he said
3947519 on the surface this could indicate a lesser degree of competition than elsewhere
3947520 but when we look a bit deeper it seems that an important reason for the high profitability of australian banks is their unusually low bad debt experience
3947521 this has been the result of the very strong domestic economy he said
3947522 it is also worth noting that other australian industries have been very profitable over this period
3947523 history shows that it is new entrants that drive competitive behaviour mr battellino said
3947524 it is also important that this information be in a form that is easy to understand he said
3947525 our view of recent events is that they are cyclical in nature rather than a permanent change to the structure of the market in the sense that when market conditions settle securitisation will pick up again he said
3947526 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent

3947549 swimming research has strived to understand water flow around a swimmer for decades because how a swimmers body moves the surrounding water is everything

3947551 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you need to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water

3947586 we will turn on the radio attraktor towers at 2 05pm on saturday august 16th
3947587 we are feeling the effects of a slowing global economy on our business this has resulted in lower than anticipated sales of our 3gpp and wifi based network products and a delay in wimax network deployments that will continue to impact projected sales of our wimax semiconductor products
3947588 current customers are expanding their networks bookings are strong and the pipeline of potential new business is large and growing this further increases our confidence in our ability to achieve the upper end of our target revenue range of 275 to 300 million for 2008
3947589 while the relative number of quarterly broadband adds has certainly peaked the decline in additions this quarter compared to the same period last year was exacerbated by verizon and at amp ts emphasis on selling higher speed fios and u verse bundled services often at the expense of the traditional dsl service
3947590 telcos are now under pressure not only in their legacy businesses landline voice but also in the next generation business broadband that is supposed to be off setting legacy market pressure most u s telcos continued to lose landlines at rates ranging for the most part from 5 percent windstream to 7 8 percent embarq and on up to 10 2 percent qwest but telcos have had a few years to get used to these numbers they are no longer surprising even though their ongoing uptick is extremely disconcerting what they have not yet gotten used to but have been warned about by market researchers within the last year or so is a slowing in broadband subscriber growth the second quarter of 2008 was perhaps the first time we have seen evidence of that pressure on an industry wide basis with at amp t verizon and other telcos adding broadband subscribers at slower rates

3947601 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3947602 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3947603 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3947604 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3947611 one of many lawyers that had been retained by cobalt toward the end of their existence
3947612 this claim that was commenced recently against us has no merit will be dismissed on motion and the decision in oster v kirschner is almost certainly res judicata against the claimants in this case
3947613 under no circumstances was our firm or mr unger involved in any fraud or complicity in aiding fraud
3947614 in september 2004 martin unger drafted an opinion letter for cobalt informing them that in his opinion nothing prohibited stitsky from running cobalts boiler room
3947615 advised cobalt that there was no requirement under the law to disclose those facts to investors

3947631 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3947632 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3947633 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3947634 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3947713 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3947714 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
3947715 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
3947716 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice

3947720 im not a racist i can prove all that and i will i think this is politically motivated and i think some people are being used
3947721 its concerning to say the least that a public official would promote this sort of vile and loathsome anti muslim and really anti american material as was included in that e mail

3947730 ridership is up on nearly every route and nearly every train across our system
3947731 the single biggest reason for this passenger growth is people avoiding the higher prices of driving their own cars and trucks
3947732 august is crazy busy anyway so yeah im tired were all tired
3947733 it just didnt make sense to have both cars down there with the price of gas

3947760 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
3947761 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3947762 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors
3947763 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
3947764 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
3947765 the pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time
3947766 it is true that his youngs rhetoric during a time of war was part of the backdrop against which the massacre happened
3947767 theres been so much misunderstanding about the event over the last 150 years especially as far as the average latter day saint is concerned the average latter day saint loves church history but unfortunately in the past these taboo subjects have gone largely ignored which created a false belief that church history ran very smoothly
3947768 its a long time overdue for a lot of people its going to open their eyes to the reality of the tragedy for the first time before the majority of the people bringing up the issues were anti mormons hopefully with lds authors it will lift peoples suspicions about books on the subject

3947779 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight
3947780 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3947781 continue to kick my ass and i will punch you in the ball sack
3947782 i discovered it because i was really tired and not and not able to sleep i went in for a routine exam and they checked it and they found out
3947783 it turns out to be a very important hormone it affects almost every tissue in the body
3947784 its sort of like the thermostat it turns up the thermostat and turns down the thermostat in your body
3947785 when someone has low thyroid condition theyre not as good in fighting stress
3947786 when im not on my medication i dont feel like my body is running to its optimal level of performance
3947787 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3947788 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3947789 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3947790 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3947791 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3947792 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3947793 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3947794 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3947795 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
3947796 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
3947797 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
3947798 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
3947799 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3947800 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3947801 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3947802 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3947803 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them

3947811 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3947812 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3947813 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3947814 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3947815 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3947816 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3947817 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3947818 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3947819 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3947820 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3947821 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3947822 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3947823 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3947824 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3947825 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3947826 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3947827 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3947828 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3947829 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3947830 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3947831 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3947832 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3947833 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3947834 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3947835 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3947836 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3947837 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

3947976 our guy couldnt have lost someone must have stolen it
3947977 i hear the boxing scoring is a blatant fuck up i saw some of the examples yesterday on cnbc and if i were some of those guys id be irate that all of my training was negated to some shit scoring system
3947978 so i am just trying to put on a smile
3947979 i was just really eager to do my routine and get the show on the road but they did hold me for quite some time and i guess i lost my nerve a little bit
3947980 that chinese guy landed two consecutive punches to the backside of the head behind the ear and recieved 2 points for it
3947981 i was just really eager to do my routine and get the show on the road but they did hold me for quite some time and i guess i lost my nerve a little bit

3947994 immigration to the united states and world wide greenhouse gas emissions
3947995 an independent non partisan non profit research organization founded in 1985 and the nations only think tank devoted exclusively to research and policy analysis of the economic social demographic fiscal and other impacts of immigration on the united states
3947996 immigration to the united states significantly increases world wide co2 emissions because it transfers population from lower polluting parts of the world to the united states which is a higher polluting country on average immigrants increase their emissions four fold by coming to america
3947997 some may be tempted to see this analysis as blaming immigrants for what are really americas failures it is certainly reasonable to argue that americans could do more to reduce per capita emissions and it is certainly not our intention to imply that immigrants are particularly responsible for global warming as we report in this study the average immigrant produces somewhat less co2 than the average native born american but to simply dismiss the large role that continuing high levels of immigration play in increasing u s and thus worldwide co2 emissions is not only intellectually dishonest it is also counterproductive one must acknowledge a problem before a solution can be found
3947998 kebenaran itu berasal dari rabb mu maka jangan sekali kali kamu termasuk orang orang yang ragu
3947999 sesungguhnya kami telah mengutusmu muhammad dengan kebenaran sebagai pembawa berita gembira dan pemberi peringatan
3948000 jika kalian berbeda pendapat tentang suatu perkara maka kembalikanlah kepada allah al quran dan rasul as sunnah
3948001 sesungguhnya al quran itu benar benar dari tuhanmu tetapi mayoritas manusia tidak beriman
3948002 sesungguhnya allah mempunyai karunia terhadap manusia tetapi mayoritas manusia tidak bersyukur
3948003 sesungguhnya kami benar benar telah membawa kebenaran kepada kalian tetapi mayoritas dari kalian membenci kebenaran itu
3948004 dan sesungguhnya mayoritas dari manusia benar benar lalai dari ayat ayat kami
3948005 dan sesungguhnya mayoritas dari manusia benar benar hendak menyesatkan orang lain dengan hawa nafsu mereka tanpa ilmu
3948006 mereka mayoritas manusia tidak lain hanyalah mengikuti persangkaan belaka dan mereka tidak lain hanyalah berdusta terhadap allah
3948007 dan sesungguhnya kami jadikan untuk isi jahannam mayoritas dari jin dan manusia
3948008 sesungguhnya di antara prinsip terbesar mereka adalah berpegang dan terbuai dengan jumlah mayoritas mereka menilai suatu kebenaran dengannya jumlah mayoritas dan menilai suatu kebatilan dengan kelangkaannya dan dengan sedikitnya orang yang melakukan
3948009 di antara karakter jahiliyyah adalah bahwasanya mereka menilai suatu kebenaran dengan jumlah mayoritas dan menilai suatu kesalahan dengan jumlah minoritas sehingga sesuatu yang diikuti oleh kebanyakan orang berarti benar sedangkan yang diikuti oleh segelintir orang berarti salah
3948010 dan jika kamu menuruti mayoritas orang orang yang ada di muka bumi ini niscaya mereka akan menyesatkanmu dari jalan allah mereka tidak lain hanyalah mengikuti persangkaan belaka dan mereka tidak lain hanyalah berdusta terhadap allah u
3948011 dan kami tidak mendapati mayoritas mereka memenuhi janji sesungguhnya kami mendapati mayoritas mereka orang orang yang fasik
3948012 telah ditampakkan kepadaku umat umat maka aku melihat seorang nabi bersamanya kurang dari 10 orang seorang nabi bersamanya satu atau dua orang dan seorang nabi tidak ada seorang pun yang bersamanya
3948013 dalam hadits ini terdapat bantahan bagi orang yang berdalih dengan hukum mayoritas dan beranggapan bahwa kebenaran itu selalu bersama mereka tidaklah demikian adanya bahkan yang semestinya adalah mengikuti al quran dan as sunnah bersama siapa saja dan di mana saja
3948014 tidak boleh tertipu dengan jumlah mayoritas karena jumlah mayoritas terkadang di atas kesesatan allah berfirman artinya
3948015 sesungguhnya orang orang melakukan demikian mengapa aku eksklusif tidak sama dengan mereka
3948016 maka tolok ukurnya bukanlah banyaknya pengikut suatu madzhab atau perkataan namun tolok ukurnya adalah benar ataukah batil selama ia benar walaupun yang mengikutinya hanya sedikit atau bahkan tidak ada yang mengikutinya maka itulah yang harus dipegang diikuti karena ia adalah keselamatan dan selamanya sesuatu yang batil tidaklah terdukung menjadi benar pen dikarenakan banyaknya orang yang mengikutinya inilah tolok ukur yang harus selalu dipegangi oleh setiap muslim
3948017 maka tolok ukurnya bukanlah banyak mayoritas atau pun sedikit minoritas bahkan tolok ukurnya adalah al haq kebenaran barangsiapa di atas kebenaran walaupun sendirian maka ia benar dan wajib diikuti dan jika mayoritas manusia berada di atas kebatilan maka wajib ditolak dan tidak boleh tertipu dengannya
3948018 kebenaran tidaklah dinilai dengan orang namun oranglah yang dinilai dengan kebenaran barangsiapa di atas kebenaran maka ia wajib diikuti
3948019 hendaknya seorang muslim berhati hati agar tidak tertipu dengan jumlah mayoritas karena telah banyak orang orang yang tertipu dengannya bahkan orang orang yang mengaku berilmu sekalipun mereka berkeyakinan di dalam beragama sebagaimana yang diyakini oleh orang orang bodoh lagi sesat mengikuti mayoritas manusia dalam beragama pen dan tidak mau melihat kepada apa yang dikatakan oleh allah dan rasul nya
3948020 ya jika mayoritas manusia berada di atas kebenaran maka ini sesuatu yang baik
3948021 dan mayoritas manusia tidak akan beriman walaupun kamu muhammad sangat menginginkannya
3948022 dan jika engkau menuruti mayoritas orang orang yang ada di muka bumi ini niscaya mereka akan menyesatkanmu dari jalan allah
3948023 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3948024 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3948025 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3948026 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3948027 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3948028 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3948029 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3948030 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3948031 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3948032 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3948033 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3948034 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3948035 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3948036 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3948037 having become an ardent reader of these blogs opinions bounce around my head waiting to be released many of these blogs seem to be intolerable of outside opinions so my thoughts comments remain unpublished this will serve as my outlet
3948038 furthermore the reason that fat acceptance bloggers are so harsh to dissenters is because its their blog its their and their members
3948039 from reading some of the comments in those fat acceptance websites the message of living well is not being promoted simply being satisfied is satisfaction may be fine for adults not willing to change but in children it can lead to complacency which can be extremely dangerous later in life
3948040 the wynn hotel has chosen not to honor its agreement to apply certain discounts to balances they have already been paid for
3948041 exposing how exactly mr wynn deceives his high end customers
3948042 pulling on the skin behind their eyes to make it look as if they were asian
3948043 to me it was little clownish for our part to be doing that the sponsor insisted and insisted they pushed because theyre the people that pay the money it was just a bad idea to do that it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
3948044 we look forward to having the community come and visit our studios the august 25th open house is a fun way to learn about access television here in grafton and how it works well take you on a tour of the studio facilities and show you demonstrations of our equipment including chroma key youll get to meet and greet current gctv producers and learn how to become the producer of your own show on channel 11
3948045 like picking away at a glacier with a plastic spoon
3948046 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
3948047 our responsibility to protect unborn children includes considering the legal framework for abortions and also supporting pregnant and single mothers and ensuring all children are welcomed and supported what is the position of political candidates on the protection of unborn children what do they say about the social and economic circumstances which contribute to higher or lower rates of abortion
3948048 the democratic party supports everything about abortion thinks its a right and will make every effort to use your tax money to further the killing of unborn especially those who are partially delivered
3948049 in addition to affirming their unequivocal support of abortion rights and taxpayer funded abortion the new proposed democratic platform language also expressly opposes the 1996 defense of marriage act the law is the greatest obstacle to nationwide same sex marriage presumably if obama is elected it will go the new language reads we oppose the defense of marriage act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us
3948050 but when the alternative is the republican party what choice do they have honestly
3948051 in addition to affirming their unequivocal support of abortion rights and taxpayer funded abortion the new proposed democratic platform language also expressly opposes the 1996 defense of marriage act the law is the greatest obstacle to nationwide same sex marriage presumably if obama is elected it will go the new language reads we oppose the defense of marriage act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us
3948052 senator obama opposes the hyde amendment and believes it should be repealed
3948053 obama believes that the federal government should not use its dollars to intrude on a poor womans decision concerning her reproductive health care
3948054 this of course also underlies the christian claim of mary divinely conceiving jesus a seed planted
3948055 when i behold your heavens the work of your fingers the moon and the stars which you set in place what is man that you should be mindful of him or the son of man that you should care for him
3948056 if i remember correctly in the not too distant past we had a debate on whether negroes what african americans were called back then were
3948057 might arguably be licit if the funding for abortion were only incidental and could not be removed from a bill that was otherwise very desirable
3948058 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
3948059 theyre preparing for the day when people realize we dont need windows anymore
3948060 i would expect those in abundance with something of this scope and import
3948061 dr myers does not seem to care if he hurts others
3948062 the situation about his lack of censure despite violating school rules is not logically explained because such is impossible the sad truth is that dr myers is being protected by his friends and colleagues who also have no respect for the religious sensibilities of others
3948063 must be committed to the highest ethical standards of conduct
3948064 ethical conduct is a fundamental expectation for every community member in practicing and modeling ethical conduct community members are expected to act according to the highest ethical and professional standards of conduct and be personally accountable for individual actions
3948065 be fair and respectful to others the university is committed to tolerance diversity and respect for differences when dealing with others community members are expected to be respectful fair and civil avoid all forms of harassment and threats and promote conflict resolution
3948066 curious is it not that people of faith who are classified as anti intellectual or backward should establish some of the nations most important colleges and universities
3948067 what i just burned some paper it has no value to me i am not required to value those photos and on top of that its utterly stupid for those people to value them
3948068 how did he threaten us he threatened and carried out an act of desecration
3948069 or was it a deliberate action aimed against catholics it was clearly the latter
3948070 the sources are entirely public read the hundreds or thousands of comments all over the internet
3948071 father joes blog is great fun to read too bad i will have to strike him dead with lightning some day
3948072 right after evening prayer i regularly read his blog and note corrections for my upcoming encyclicals
3948073 before i have my security council meeting each morning i check to see whats new at fr joes blog
3948074 this infidel priest is not funny and is ill informed
3948075 he is a right wing bigot who is anti choice and anti woman the goddess is not happy with his blog
3948076 he is the poorest priest i know always pontificating about things he knows nothing about he is a disgrace
3948077 the invasion is going as planned and soon all the clergy will be pod people from outer space starting with father joe
3948078 never have i met someone who was so opposed to true ecumenism and religious freedom i would like to sacrifice him in my dinner pot and wear his head as an ornament voices like his need to be silenced we should all pray and sup together
3948079 it is time now to take the energy this campaign has awakened and channel it into long term efforts to
3948080 in a scurrilous new attack sen obama is the victim of discredited allegations
3948081 a crude mix of right wingery lame puns and puerile innuendo
3948082 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3948083 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
3948084 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
3948085 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
3948086 go on google and type in bigfoot found and check the results
3948087 a veces nos sent bamos a hablar cuando est bamos tranquilos y l se compromet a a no gastar m s no hab a pasado ni una semana cuando le ve a llegar con unas camisas nuevas de marca empezaban las peleas luego empez a esconder sus compras lo cual era incluso peor porque siempre terminaba encontr ndolas tuvimos que declararnos en bancarrota

3948090 we had both worked in sports television for over 20 years and when they kleenex talked to us about it we have told a lot of these stories over the years and with that in mind we thought that we could definitely do it well we loved their ad campaign and we were inspired by it
3948091 hopefully the audience will be inspired i hope that they will take the moments and think about their lives twelve of the people you will see are everyday people like you and me
3948092 right in the middle of the interview his father shows up and he sits down with mike in the chair and they both reminisced together and i have never laughed so hard in my life
3948093 the special committee would consider a proposal that recognizes the value of the company and reflects the significant benefits that would accrue to roche as a result of full ownership
3948094 at some price however high the independent directors are willing sellers
3948095 roche continues to believe its proposal is fair and generous
3948096 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3948097 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3948098 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3948099 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
3948100 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3948101 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3948102 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3948103 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
3948104 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
3948105 i am compelled to bring their falsity to your attention
3948106 refrain from making any further untrue statement regarding the relationship between st mary of the lake seminary mundelein and the diocese of rockford

3948110 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3948111 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3948112 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3948113 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
3948114 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3948115 were proud of anyone who has worked on the side of angels in fledgling democracies
3948116 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians

3948239 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3948240 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3948241 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3948242 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3948243 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3948244 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3948245 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3948246 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3948247 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3948248 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3948249 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3948250 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3948251 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3948252 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3948253 no were not afraid of losing wow subscribers to diablo iii
3948254 theres not as big of a crossover as we expected between the two communities but were certainly hoping that the wow community will be interested in diii
3948255 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3948256 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know former pennsylvania governor tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
3948257 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than new york city mayor michael bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
3948258 what we also tried to do is create very clean textures so that you can really focus its a stylized feel and in that sense its very sort of a blizzard philosophy its just really pushing the envelope in terms of the visuals so that everyone is excited about how everything looks we think that diablo iii is going to be better in so many different ways were just building and improving upon the the first and second diablo games
3948259 were very involved because everyones very passionate about our games blizzard employees we spend a lot of time actually iterating on the game and so in terms of the next phase what well try to do is a proof on concept on lot of different gameplay aspects and we really want to get as much feedback as possible so that we can improve on the game and ensure that we meet blizzard quality for our fans and for ourselves as players
3948260 what is it you want to play what is it that you want to make
3948261 it can no longer be assumed that welfare is greater at an all around higher level of production than at a lower one the higher level of production has merely a higher level of want creation necessitating a higher level of want satisfaction
3948262 i have a zero threshold for insignificant facts i will cut people off if they dont answer my question
3948263 being a state senator where i have a forum to criticize him
3948264 when youre down there at the capitol every day and youre frustrated sure you think about it

3948272 the process is set up so that the letters go out several days prior to the instance of mail being redirected

3948274 typically a 30 to 60 day review period is prudent and normal
3948275 with all due respect to entergys self imposed deadline fema owes it to the people and the state of new york to do a thorough evaluation
3948276 i lost about 20 pounds but beyond that im feeling fine
3948277 i was just worried about him and just wanted him to know that we still love him
3948278 we got together in the locker room and gave him a big hug and just told him how we felt about him
3948279 hes too passionate just to give it up like that
3948280 he loves the game he loves the game so much hes going to ride this thing until the wheels fall off ill tell you that
3948281 hes a relentless personality a relentless coach and he just never allows himself to give in to anything
3948282 he attacked this the way he attacks the game and the way he attacks life and didnt let anyone feel sorry for him
3948283 on the court hes crazy but off the court hell do anything for you

3948295 first canadian team to get into the olympics now first to the quarter finals weve cleared a lot of hurdles as a team you know this is just another one
3948296 we have taken major strides by getting to the olympic games quarter finals its a fantastic accomplishment
3948297 i dont think the players are pleased or happy i think theyre eager to keep moving into the semis and to do that the most important thing is to replicate the type of performance we had the last three games
3948298 we were just kind of laughing and i said to her okay lets do it then
3948299 i think it would be foolish to underestimate them because theyre missing one player
3948300 social networks bedoel je samen in de kroeg zitten met vrienden en bier drinken

3948307 i think people understand we have always tried to regionalize our product
3948308 they see what weve done in rochester where the bills hold their training camp over the past decade
3948309 were looking to do everything we can to keep the franchise viable and having a market like toronto that is so vibrant wed be remiss if we didnt reach out into it
3948310 we will stay on a schedule in terms of this game in terms of people we want to play and when we want to see them
3948311 but wed like to win it with whos on the field and were not going to change our approach to the football game
3948312 they are very aware of whats going on within our organization and what were trying to do in order to keep our franchise healthy and viable
3948313 we know we have a loyal fan base here and back in western new york
3948314 wed like to expand our fan base here and were excited about the opportunity
3948315 its a tremendous place so much culture with a lot to do
3948316 pre season games have been played in canada before but to a regular nfl season game were excited to be part of that a new introduction of nfl football to the canadian market
3948317 ive built a quiet confidence within myself where the most nerve racking part was this right here the press conference
3948318 and that more than anything was just because we didnt have that in the ahl
3948319 i could tell right away when he walked through my office door that there was chemistry and that we were speaking the same language
3948320 i feel that my experience in providence will help me
3948321 we didnt have the team that anybody wouldve picked to win the amount of games that we did
3948322 it didnt just take coaching xs and os it took the players buying into the system that we play and being accountable to each other

3948433 the secret of the companys success in the american market wasnt that it sold coffee it sold coffee culture the other aspect of starbucks appeal in the u s has been its establishment of the cafe as a social hub but when starbucks came to australia to bring coffee and the cafe culture to the masses it found that we already had it particularly in melbourne we have better coffee and more relaxing cafes than anything that starbucks brought with it

3948440 under our administration the federal government will institute a zero base budget policy this means that every cent of every department budget will have to be justified on an annual basis no agency will be able to assume their budget level is safe and no agency will be able to go after any increases in funds until they can prove that they are spending all existing funds efficiently and for the public good in such a budget system there is no room for pork barrel projects
3948441 the real secret to winning an independent campaign is not attracting already semi committed voters it is to interest the disenfranchised those that are so dissatisfied with what is happen in politics today and within their old parties they have dropped out of the political system we hope to give these citizens who are now ignored by the two major parties and who make up a majority of the potential electorate a new and better option if we can attract these voters back into politics we have a real shot at winning
3948442 maybe my ideas are good maybe not so good that is for the voters to decide
3948443 i just know that in the last few elections i spent my time deciding who was the lesser of two evils not who i felt good about voting for that to me is sad we are the greatest nation on earth but we end up with only two choices to head the country neither of who excite me at all

3948460 he hit nose first and blew atyre and as he came down the rotors struck the ground and went flying
3948461 in alan carpenters leadership what you have is a practical bloke whos got a long term vision for the states future and is prepared to take hard decisions
3948462 what we want to do is partner with a government like this the key thing for us is to make sure the state leaders were dealing with are practical people like alan carpenter
3948463 oh we all have our problems on the way through
3948464 state elections however they turn out these are always in my experience fought essentially on state factors on state grounds
3948465 but i say this do we have a state government which has a strong plan for the future and can we partner with that plan in a very practical way with this premier i can work

3948487 common ground moving the conversation beyond the question of the legality of abortion and move towards sic actually reducing the need for abortion by investing in programs that will reduce both unintended pregnancies and abortions
3948488 this all sounds very nice and im sure its well intentioned but it uses right wing frames to build the discussion then appeals to a center ground thats actually skewed pretty badly
3948489 the only reason to refer to abortion on demand is to depict it as unnecessary an elective procedure like plastic surgery
3948490 and why precisely do we have a moral obligation to find common ground i suppose to help women and families make other choices
3948491 and we have to split the difference with them why
3948492 t he only way to make sense of the argument as hes framed it is to assume that abortion is a moral bad and that women need to be guided away from them sic
3948493 the strategic mistake here is to assume that the conservative interest is in reducing abortion its not thats only a positive result of the real interest which is in regulating womens sexuality

3948509 when we look at bank profitability we find that australian banks are around the top of the international range he said
3948510 on the surface this could indicate a lesser degree of competition than elsewhere
3948511 but when we look a bit deeper it seems that an important reason for the high profitability of australian banks is their unusually low bad debt experience
3948512 this has been the result of the very strong domestic economy he said
3948513 it is also worth noting that other australian industries have been very profitable over this period
3948514 history shows that it is new entrants that drive competitive behaviour mr battellino said
3948515 it is also important that this information be in a form that is easy to understand he said

3948534 manchester united need to win euopean cups its a great challenge every year at united but a greater challenege than ever this time as we try to repeat the success of last season as a team
3948535 for me personally its a great challenge to try and break into a team thats just won the double
3948536 last season i would say he was probably in our top two or three most consistent players he was fantastic throughout the season and deserved all the success he got including a place with england
3948537 ive got a number of challenges ahead of me and the ultimate one is to try and get back in that team in front of wes thats going to be hard for me with the way wes performed last season even though he is younger than me hes a great example of how you recover from an injury and how you come back
3948538 the strength of the squad now is enormous and with the youth in the squad and the ability i do feel we are in a better position but we have to show that important mentality and character to show we can go and do it again
3948539 no manchester united has ever been able to go on and repeat that success year in year out weve waited nine years from 1999 we cant afford to wait that long again weve got to go and prove ourselves
3948540 weve always talked about being a great club but bayern munich ajax and real madrid have all gone on to repeat their success and thats what manchester united have to do
3948541 ive believe as a fan as im sure all fans do that manchester united should be in that category
3948542 as older players now weve been through that and we can see that those youngter players are delivering the spirit in the dressing room that wins your european cups and championships
3948543 a team doesnt win the european cup based purely on ability they win it because they have a desire and a spirit with them we could see that last season i sat and watched it for 12 months to see them come into carrington every morning i could see those players taking over the dressing room

3948570 the jack screw is an important component that has been known to seize up in the past regular lubrication and checking of the jack screw is vital because corrosion poses a real risk and must be eliminated to prevent this key component from seizing up
3948571 boeing issued a directive that this component needed to be checked more rigorously and more regularly
3948572 there was a maintenance issue involving the lubrication of a jack screw on a boeing 747 400 qantas found this through a routine check of our maintenance records
3948573 the jack screw had been inspected and the aircraft will operate tomorrow

3948578 were constantly working towards improving and continuing to upgrade the health care system as it applies directly to canadian soldiers who have served
3948579 it is unacceptable in my view to have a disparity of treatment that leaves a soldier feeling as if his or her country or government is not responding to their needs
3948580 so if that requires further investment were looking at that if that requires hiring more health care professionals for a certain niche area like mental health we are doing that

3948593 americans are in denial about how widespread this problem is
3948594 we know from our research that parental engagement being involved in your kids lives monitoring what theyre up to is a very key component in teen substance risk
3948595 we know how to change behavior and attitudes that is what we do
3948596 we know what messages will work and what will not
3948597 people know outside is going to feel much better for them but underpredict how happy theyre going to feel after being outside in nature even 15 minutes
3948598 the people inside overestimate their happiness about being inside its this error in judgment people have about how happy they are in a different environment that may explain why people dont spend more time in nature
3948599 rather than changing their ways to protect the environment the results of this study suggest that these people may give up on their efforts to protect the environment
3948600 i think most people recognize we face a severe environmental crisis but its hard to deal with that head on because most people feel helpless to do anything about it
3948601 if we look at the nature of the problem it is so big its hard to know what any individual can do in their own life to make a difference
3948602 the tendency when people are confronted with an overwhelming problem is to run away from it so psychologists are very experienced in dealing with that
3948603 one of the first things you think of is turning off lights when you leave a room or changing the thermostat settings in the house they dont think first of caulking windows or upgrading your furnace
3948604 more insulation in the attic and tight windows make more difference than changing the thermostat setting having a more fuel efficient car makes more difference than any amount youre likely to decrease driving
3948605 people showed strong approval for other students who recycled you would hope to see people disapprove of people who dont recycle but they didnt disapprove
3948606 we are recognizing that environmental problems have a tremendous impact on many aspects of our lives but we need a lot more work
3948607 we cant afford to let this increased environmental concern become just another fashionable trend

3948617 funding costs for the banks across all sources had probably fallen by about 25 to 30 basis points in recent weeks he told a federal parliamentary committee hearing in sydney
3948618 people have been pushing the banks to give more commitment to the fact that they would follow the reserve bank when the reserve bank cuts interest rates
3948619 the banks have responded to that quite cautiously and have been quite non committal
3948620 my guess is really whats happening here is the banks are saying well its unreasonable for them to give commitments when they dont know when the rba is going to move or by how much
3948621 thats why we now find we are in a position to cut interest rates mr battellino added
3948622 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late mr battellino said
3948623 overall when we look at all the evidence which we have its reasonable to conclude that the australian financial sector is competitive and that it stacks up quite well across a range of international benchmarks
3948624 our view is that these recent events are cyclical in nature and do not represent permanent change to the structure of the market in the sense that when markets settle we expect securitisation to pick up again mr battellino said
3948625 when we started the business we used paid advertising and in our company right now we consider paid advertising kind of a drug so we definitely migrated away from that addiction and using pr and social networking and blogs to essentially build a viral effect to our service
3948626 for us is finding very passionate early stage users and having them help iterate the service and then when we think were ready for a product going to people like bloggers its free pr free marketing essentially
3948627 the first thing we spent money on after we spent money on engineers was a pr person somebody that was dedicated to work with the blogosphere that was even before we have salespeople in our case the very first deal we got was in india with tata one of the largest operator out there and that was because somebody there read about us on gigaom so thats the power of the blogosphere businesses from around the world are sending people here on an on going basis to see whats going on so if participate in those events chances are you are going to hook up with a global audience
3948628 hey just so you know there is someone else her name is and shes really pretty really short but very intelligent shes patient she listens and she doesnt get jealous

3948630 at the heart of the wellington political process for close to 30 years
3948631 equality fairness and freedom a labour view on kiwi politics labour candidate for hunua
3948632 they called and i didnt really quite believe it i was hoping i was still asleep and it was a dream but it was for real
3948633 im sure she wouldnt have gone into that situation if she had known nothings worth that
3948634 shes made a huge difference in the world already but i think its just a tragedy a stupid waste that she should be brought to a halt so violently and so soon she had so much that she was offering people
3948635 in the last two three years she travelled at least half a year maybe more and to many different countries her suitcase was sort of installed at the top of the stairs always being unpacked or repacked or en route
3948636 she knew what she wanted she would work hard to get it she didnt suffer fools gladly she had a mission and she took it very seriously she had a huge smile she really loved life she loved travelling she loved seeing different countries
3948637 ive spoken with staff in afghanistan she was terribly well regarded very very well regarded by the staff and by the afghan community as i understand it
3948638 she was very hard working utterly compassionate and committed to her work a real believer in humanitarian assistance
3948639 she was a smart committed talented young woman who went to a difficult part of the world where the needs are extensive to apply the skills that she had acquired over the years in her education and professional experience
3948640 she was courageous compassionate lovely brave hard working and utterly committed to what she was doing
3948641 she was very very good at her work she really was as good as it gets as a humanitarian worker and as an individual and we are heartbroken and utterly grief stricken by her loss
3948642 her energy cheerfulness generosity and critical mind will be sorely missed by her colleagues in education and the feminist community at mcgill
3948643 knowing the risks associated with working in a conflict zone these humanitarian aid workers gave selflessly to help improve the lives of the afghan people
3948644 their spirits will live on in the continued efforts of all who are assisting in the reconstruction of afghanistan

3948651 be not like the foolish husbandsmen who sowed in his ground cooked and frozen and rotted seeds and the autumn came and his field bore nothing and great was his distress but be like the wise husbandsmen who planted in his field living seed and whose field bore living ears of wheat paying a hundredfold for the seeds which he planted for i tell you truly live only by the fire of life and prepare not your foods with the fire of death which kills your foods your bodies and your souls also

3948657 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3948658 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3948659 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3948660 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3948661 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3948662 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3948663 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3948664 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3948665 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3948666 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3948667 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3948668 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3948669 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3948683 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3948684 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3948685 it really makes little sense to try to upgrade our infrastructure using a revenue source as ineffective unsustainable and unpopular as the fuel tax
3948686 secretary peters plan to overhaul our nations transportation investment strategy begins the much needed transition away from status quo solutions that produce status quo results her plan strengthens the abilities of state and local officials to integrate effective transit and highway solutions to meet americans ever changing travel demands
3948687 its uncommon to see people dressed up like this so the victims were watching them
3948688 i get asked i want one of those plug ins like i saw my neighbor drive around but they dont understand what its going to take to make us competitive here
3948689 stop thinking of us in terms of competing against each other
3948690 we are working on the development of the complete phev system which includes high energy capacity cells battery management electronics control software and an efficient thermal management system all optimally packaged for safety and efficient integration into the vehicle
3948691 there is a sort of strange flaw in the thinking at the federal level that encourages development but not u s production of these technologies
3948692 gm ford and chrysler arent competing against each other theyre competing against the world
3948693 we have to look at it as national survival nobody is going to do this on their own
3948694 we had invested in ford escape hybrids but were not happy with their mileage we were only getting about 27 mpg
3948695 we felt we could do better and we identified the priuses as meeting our needs weve only had them a month and weve found that they average 40 mpg
3948696 we probably drive these courier vehicles 20 000 to 30 000 miles a year and the priuses save us thousands of gallons of gas
3948697 with the initial shock of high gas prices fading consumers are returning to rationality and again viewing gas consumption as just one of many factors when considering their next vehicle
3948698 and as gas prices actually decline this trend could accelerate
3948699 if it was three bucks a gallon i think people would change their buying habits
3948700 i think the shift in buyer attitudes weve seen this time because of gas prices is the most dramatic in all the time ive been in the business
3948701 this one has made a permanent mark on peoples memories
3948702 highlighting the importance of keeping our eye on the ball during this brief reprieve from higher oil prices
3948703 automotive trends prompted by shifting consumer priorities need to continue full speed ahead
3948704 gas prices not incentives are the driving force behind recent consideration shifts

3948709 the violation is clear and indeed uncontroverted the state improperly disclosed grand jury testimony to another police officer
3948710 our family today still feels that the ruling just proves again that the justice system here in new orleans is still flawed
3948711 bill gwatney is an individual who cares a great deal about arkansas and its future
3948712 this is a perfect time to grow as aggressively as we are
3948713 every cloud has a silver lining in the case of a company like the bargain shop we are an extreme value retailer
3948714 in difficult economic times in particular with the increase in energy costs its something that coincides very well with our strong suit which is offering good quality merchandise close to peoples homes people want to save on gas
3948715 the whole category of giant tiger bargain shop dollar stores has been doing well and is likely to do better as the economy weakens
3948716 people of all income ranges are quite happy to shop at a dollar store in the morning and gucci in the afternoon
3948717 does not support the belief that organically grown foodstuffs generally contain more major and trace elements
3948718 the opportunity to work on this leading edge science bringing some of these learnings to fruition for consumers while drawing on my previous flavanol experience is what really energized me about this opportunity

3948723 in terms of the scope and international dimension of this attack its a landmark
3948724 international laws are very poorly developed so it really crosses a line into murky territory is an information blockade an act of war
3948725 seems like the kind of thing that a sophisticated military would want to experiment with
3948726 imagine how devastating it would be to a military commander to lose access to a server that tells him where his troops are stationed and where he has resources
3948727 this is the first time weve had such strong evidence of cyberwarfare
3948728 its an ongoing battle in documenting where its coming from and helping people get around it

3948737 in federal court affidavits mr ngs lawyers contend that when he complained of severe pain that did not respond to analgesics and grew too weak to walk or even stand to call his family from a detention pay phone officials accused him of faking his condition they denied him a wheelchair and refused pleas for an independent medical evaluation instead the affidavits say guards at the donald w wyatt detention facility in central falls r i dragged him from his bed on july 30 carried him in shackles to a car bruising his arms and legs and drove him two hours to a federal lockup in hartford where an immigration officer pressured him to withdraw all pending appeals of his case and accept deportation

3948740 we dont want the first time people were trying to keep this simple at first
3948741 i looked the man in the eye i found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy we had a very good dialogue i was able to get a sense of his soul a man deeply commited to his country and the best interests of his country
3948742 this is your wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the nations
3948743 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3948744 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3948745 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3948746 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3948747 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3948748 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3948749 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3948750 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3948751 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3948752 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3948753 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3948754 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3948755 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3948756 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3948757 you make it hard to smile because you make it hard to breathe
3948758 i wanna know if i could be someone to turn to that could never hurt you but i know what you think of me you had a breakthrough and now im just bad news for you
3948759 whoa oh whoa whoa oh why do i put myself in these situations whoa oh whoa whoa oh i keep pushing myself even though i cant take it at all
3948760 this life is way too short to get caught up and all mixed up when i just want you to love me back
3948761 if you take it personal then you should be in that line of work
3948762 welcome to xyz my name is jenna john how may i help you
3948763 actually i found the issue jenna john im sorry to have called have a good day
3948764 those two men are to be released i saw the video from the cameras on the streets officer hiuk you are suspended without pay for a week for abuse of power officer smith for being his accomplice you will be forced to do all the paperwork for him yourself and the three officers beneath you am i understood
3948765 understood chief kiuefu ill get on the paperwork right away
3948766 im sorry for that there is at least one corrupted officer in the unit he was just trying to get a raise through arrests he was one away from getting a pay raise and getting a chance to be promoted now i have to go through the camera histories and see what arrests will be taken off his resume
3948767 there was no harm done to my brother my comrade or their weapons so we are in good shape
3948768 but there is a no flying law unless you have a flying permit from city hall a citizens identification card a registry of your weapons name make and style and how many people the weapon can carry
3948769 thats too much work well stick with walking while were here
3948770 do you have a map of these no fly zones so we dont go through this problem again
3948771 we sure do theres a pamphlet over there that are free to all those who visit the station they mark all the zones and what you need to be able to fly in them without problems from the police
3948772 of course these only apply to the normal everyday person these dont apply to the magos oscuros they are free to fly anywhere they want
3948773 i cant believe the magos are labeled as good guys in this place and whats worst is that chief who was nice is in league with them
3948774 good thing we knocked ben out or he would have killed everyone in there
3948775 why would he kill everyone in there if the ch i ef is the only one with an emblem then why go after everyone else
3948776 its a militia teaching in akamaru if you take out the leader you need to take care of the underlings so no one can take over and with how ben fought before i introduced myself ill say he had some militia training
3948777 well master ang was his teacher and our father hiroto trained him
3948778 whoa whoa whoa hiroto captain of the guard hiroto trent nods that is something no wonder he is deadly accurate with his attacks
3948779 you were raised as a fighter from birth no wonder you are strong and straight forward and hellbent on killing those who wronged you
3948780 well according to what ben drew here the two weapons in this direction look like a small knife and a gun i think thats what they are
3948781 hey next time you need to knock my master out try not knocking me out either
3948782 there better not be a next time this entire town is corrupted with magos i need to kill the magos notices park where are we
3948783 were in a park in this town can you tell us what these shapes are
3948784 this one is a scapel and that one is a gun
3948785 well we knew one of the shapes we were looking for so if its a scapel the first place is a hospital damn why does a key need to be there
3948786 the hospital clinic in akamaru wasnt the best place to be in fact it was downright scary even i would rather face the hellmouth then go to that place
3948787 the big bad reaper is afraid of a little clinic uncontrolled laughter
3948788 maybe the person who has the scapel isnt a doctor
3948789 the scapel may belong to a beautiful nurse i could talk her into coming with us
3948790 what we need is a living weapon detector if we had that we could log in reapers hellias coatls and blunts energy signitures and then locate new ones
3948791 well with earth magic we can locate it through sonic vibrations on the ground if anyone has a living weapon and is walking around i can sense it but i will need trent to invoke the spell
3948792 you have to live life your way but remember what i said if you lose yourself to the power i will have to defeat you
3948793 there is little doubt that the significant decline in inflationary expectations in august is associated with the steep fall in crude oil prices over the last month
3948794 the effect of income tax cuts and the path of crude oil prices are significant factors in determining future inflationary expectations
3948795 im not going to be responsible for putting in fuelwatch that could actually put prices up and squeeze out independents senator fielding told sky news
3948796 if the rudd government is absolutely fair dinkum and they think this is going to save motorists money and the nrma in new south wales supports it then lets introduce it in new south wales and if it works then we can roll it out across the country
3948797 assistant treasurer chris bowen he comes from new south wales so if he believes its going to save motorists put it in new south wales and then well see what happens
3948798 i think the government is grasping at straws in trying to get petrol prices down
3948799 family first for two years has been saying that we should be cutting the petrol tax and that will get the petrol prices down
3948800 the rudd government should come out of the closet they should come out and support that now
3948801 that anyone could come into the school after hours and take advantage of defenceless animals that have been lovingly cared for by our students is disappointing
3948802 there will be consequences for the students according to their level of involvement
3948803 the college has put procedures in place to manage the wellbeing of all students
3948804 it is run for years 9 12 and we would have 150 plus kids involved including vce level to prepare them for university it is not a mickey mouse subject
3948805 we have entered into a one year deal which is by mutual agreement given the blueprint for the new nbl in season 2009 10 and beyond remains to be finalised
3948806 both fox sports and the league see this agreement as a stepping stone to a longer term deal and we are grateful for fox sports continued support of basketball while we undertake the major restructure of the nbl
3948807 given the fact that we are currently undergoing a major review of our entire sport that is expected to see the face of the nbl change considerably in season 2009 10 this is a vote of confidence by fox sports in the future of our sport
3948808 basketball as a sport has made the difficult choice of undergoing some short term pain for the long term benefit of the sport as part of their commercial review and were excited about the future direction that has been mapped out
3948809 with a tighter 10 team competition this season the nbl promises to be a thrilling spectacle in 2008 09 and were pleased to be the official broadcaster of the sport once again
3948810 funding costs for the banks across all sources had probably fallen by about 25 to 30 basis points in recent weeks
3948811 people have been pushing the banks to give more commitment to the fact that they would follow the reserve bank when the reserve bank cuts interest rates
3948812 the banks have responded to that quite cautiously and have been quite non committal
3948813 my guess is really whats happening here is the banks are saying well its unreasonable for them to give commitments when they dont know when the rba is going to move or by how much
3948814 thats why we now find we are in a position to cut interest rates
3948815 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late
3948816 overall when we look at all the evidence which we have its reasonable to conclude that the australian financial sector is competitive and that it stacks up quite well across a range of international benchmarks
3948817 our view is that these recent events are cyclical in nature and do not represent permanent change to the structure of the market in the sense that when markets settle we expect securitisation to pick up again

3948828 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
3948829 to somehow suggest obama is supportive of gun owners because he says so when he is in montana running for president is absurd

3948861 where russia can threaten a neighbour occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3948862 as the russians move into georgia as aggressors and if you read the statements from the beginning from senator mccain and senator obama one had a kind of moral neutrality to it
3948863 and i say it respectfully to senator obama because hes a gifted young man but hes not ready to be president on jan 20th of 2009
3948864 i think that whatever we think at the moment that we can all reserve that for a future time

3948870 you should be aware of your rights so as to ensure that you secure your full entitlements as well as being aware of the obligations of your chief officer and police authority under those regulations and determinations
3948871 our members together with chief officers and police authorities are expected to comply with their obligations under the police regulations and determinations this is particularly so when police officers are dissatisfied with the way we are being treated by the government
3948872 the official side offered the police a three year pay deal which was one of the most generous in the public sector regrettably they rejected it that is why we were forced to offer a one year deal
3948873 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected

3949066 aquelas crian as amp no vizinho n o abaixam a m sica
3949067 i had a dream the other night that you were pregnant it was crazy
3949068 i thought so so be careful and dont make any little es unless you want to
3949069 i thought we got some great work in today i thought both sides were very professional in their approach we have a little different schemes on both sides of the ball and it was good work for dallas and obviously the broncos we have a practice this afternoon and im looking forward to that
3949070 they have a different type of offense and a different type of defense we get a chance to work against a 3 4 look and they get a chance to take a look at a four man front i thought it was good for both teams it was a very healthy practice and there was some good fresh hitting you go against somebody where you dont know their tendencies so everybody plays a little bit more honest and its a good evaluation process for us
3949071 what you want to do when youre taking a look at your otas when youre taking a look at your summer camp you want to find your best 53 guys that can play you want to get better as a scheme offensively defensively and special teams this is a little bit different here normally that third week of practice you get tired of hitting against each other this is a good changeup for both teams where you get a chance to go against different schemes and different people i thought it was good for both squads
3949072 normally the first couple of weeks of training camp you want to install your offense and defense to go against a team too early would kind of take away what you are trying to put in as your basic fundamentals to installing your offense defense and special teams usually its better before your second preseason game because you have all of that installation in you have a preseason game under your belt you know who you want to evaluate and you get a chance to do it against different people
3949073 you change it up we went there last year obviously they are playing at our facility so they are going to come here we will probably do the same thing next year if we play the cowboys in preseason
3949074 we brought in a couple of corners poole and cb wale dada that we thought would give us more depth at that position guys that we feel have more of a chance to make our football team sometimes you make changes after a game based on how they play we didnt feel like either of those players cb lamont reid and cb christian morton could make our football team so we went in a different direction and brought some guys in that we thought could compete for possibly making our squad
3949075 he has been playing with the first team and second team throughout camp we have some competition there at middle linebacker and we will find out at the end of camp who steps up and who is our starter we have two guys koutouvides and lb nate webster that are practicing extremely well and we want to give both guys a chance to practice and play with the first team unit part of the evaluation process is how they play in practice and how thy play here in the games so we will have a chance to do both
3949076 i dont know if he picks his play up any more brandon has been doing this throughout camp i think you get a chance to see him against different people and obviously a very good football team in the cowboys its always nice to see a guy step up and make some plays like he did
3949077 naturally it does players and coaches you want to perform in front of your peers you want to practice well you want to play well and at the same time we want to evaluate a lot of people we have a chance to do it all today
3949078 to be honest with you they take advantage of an opportunity rb selvin young was obviously injured at texas but he came in here stayed healthy and took advantage of an opportunity any time you get a scholarship and are averaging about five and a half to six yards per carry at texas you know you have a big upside and he is taking advantage of that opportunity here
3949079 well he guaranteed 2 000 yards i think so he is going to be much better we have a long way to go though
3949080 i thought it went well obviously they are one of the best teams in the nfl theyre big physical and fast it went well though we are going to go back and look at the tapes to see what we did well and what we didnt do so well on but its definitely good to get somebody else in here instead of the same defenses over and over again i thought it went well
3949081 thats exactly what it is for us we have a young team with a lot of new guys dallas is one of the top three teams in the nfl it gives us a good measuring stick to see where we are at and exactly how far we need to go
3949082 dallas is dallas and they are going to do whatever they are going to do we are the broncos and we are not going to try and emulate them we are going to handle ourselves exactly the way our owner does and the way mike shanahan does we are going to be first class and go about our business
3949083 i talked with him before practice and he has dealt with it for a long time he said it was manageable just like i have been doing for the last four or five months he went through his career with it and i dont see any reason why i cant
3949084 we have two young guys on the outside ryan clady and ryan harris they are young but they are fighting i think they are going to be good if not great tackles in the future both ryans got a taste against houston and this is going to be a good test for them in the next two days im comfortable and i think they have done a great job so far
3949085 you see some guys breathing a little bit harder brandon marshall was gassed because he was so juiced up you have adrenaline running and it is fun it is game like out here and you get to see somebody different go against different looks and gauge where you are at i love doing it
3949086 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
3949087 to somehow suggest obama is supportive of gun owners because he says so when he is in montana running for president is absurd
3949088 we are going to make sure that anybody that tells montana gun owners that barack obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight

3949108 el resultado es muy bueno aunque all deberemos sentenciar porque el wisla es un equipo que corre mucho

3949116 en este tipo de partidos es vital que ellos no hayan marcado
3949117 estoy contento por el resultado aunque hubiera podido ser a n m s amplio por las muchas ocasiones que hemos tenido
3949118 hay que ser prudentes porque hist ricamente hemos tenido algunos sustos con eliminatorias bien encaradas
3949119 asumimos el reto del exceso de confianza entre al afici n hemos jugado muy bien y hemos marcado muchos goles durante el ltimo mes el objetivo es mantener este nivel en la liga y en la champions si nos clasificamos nuestra obligaci n es ser prudentes pero no podemos evitar que la afici n se ilusione

3949166 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
3949167 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
3949168 it was a public road and the toll was put on it by the previous coalition government
3949169 we did commit in 1995 to remove the toll the contract prevented us from doing that without massive payment from the taxpayers so we introduced cashback
3949170 in 2010 the concession period ends and the toll is scheduled to come off

3949181 we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness

3949183 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters
3949184 as so often the prince of waless views are in tune with public opinion
3949185 even the gung ho gm us department of agriculture accepts that currently available gm crops do not increase the yield potential only pr firms working for the gm industry claim otherwise 2
3949186 agribiz owned and patented gm seeds that only grow true for one season and which need large inputs of chemical fertilisers and pesticides will not deliver greater global food security they were not designed to meet the needs of poor farmers in developing countries but to maintain the profits of the vast multinational companies who make both the gm seeds and the chemicals used on them prince charles previous pithy summary of gm crops as new uses for old herbicides was spot on
3949187 currently available gm crops do not increase the yield potential of a hybrid variety in fact yield may even decrease if the varieties used to carry the herbicide tolerant or insect resistant genes are not the highest yielding cultivars
3949188 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present
3949189 gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
3949190 global political effort must be channelled into securing long lasting green farming solutions that put people not corporations at their heart and the uk government must look at the evidence before falling for gm industry hype
3949191 prince charless comments are a welcome contribution to the ongoing debate about gm crops around the world
3949192 the prince has also focused on the environmental impacts of gm crops especially on the soil
3949193 the debate about gm crops is not only about science and the princes comments will enable the wider social economic cultural and political issues to get the attention they deserve
3949194 it is hard to figure out what they did to it

3949219 its really scary this is really going to devastate the middle class in ways were just understanding
3949220 i could easily see that 25 or 30 heating oil retailers would not be able to make it through the next heating season without any question

3949232 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo
3949233 the tie buy that just came in scored 49 and it looks like a dud
3949234 i think any book written about the current housing mortgage disaster should have a chapter dedicated to all the insiders who seemed to truly disbelieve it even when it was happening a lot of bank and homebuilding insiders were loading up on stocks that had fallen from 40 to 20 only to see them go to 5 indymac insiders were buying big in feb or march at 3 4 only to see the bank collapse in july
3949235 remember the gold old days when this crummy i buy at tasr would be good for 300
3949236 the underlying principle here is that those small amount i buys arent likely to signal anything though we used to make 200 on junk like that all the time
3949237 another change from the past for many years banks never worked now they sometimes do because an i buy can be a major positive sign at a bank in distress but unfortunately an amazing number of insiders have bet on banks whose situation then deteriorated badly some of these insiders just didnt get it over the years we saw evidence that a lot of directors were out of the loop or just lied to but even officers have been betting on some of these dud banks the pros running real money know that officers know much more than directors do

3949250 the tri border region is suspicious because of its movement
3949251 yes we have guns and drugs especially marijuana that move through paraguay toward another destination there is movement because there is a market paraguay sells what it has and shouldnt be blamed for doing so there is only one law working here that of the market and it is the only law that matters
3949252 so it has historically depended on exporting to brazil and argentina to sustain itself ciudad del este was born about 50 years ago with the specific intention to encourage this kind of market
3949253 most of them have never used those things before and probably wouldnt know how to load a bullet if you asked them
3949254 we usually sell more than that 200 or so but we can do 50 one second

3949301 they will take away the big steel cage we sometimes have to drive around in
3949302 there is little doubt that the significant decline in inflationary expectations in august is associated with the steep fall in crude oil prices over the last month
3949303 the effect of income tax cuts and the path of crude oil prices are significant factors in determining future inflationary expectations
3949304 funding costs for the banks across all sources had probably fallen by about 25 to 30 basis points in recent weeks
3949305 people have been pushing the banks to give more commitment to the fact that they would follow the reserve bank when the reserve bank cuts interest rates
3949306 the banks have responded to that quite cautiously and have been quite non committal
3949307 my guess is really whats happening here is the banks are saying well its unreasonable for them to give commitments when they dont know when the rba is going to move or by how much
3949308 thats why we now find we are in a position to cut interest rates
3949309 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late
3949310 overall when we look at all the evidence which we have its reasonable to conclude that the australian financial sector is competitive and that it stacks up quite well across a range of international benchmarks
3949311 our view is that these recent events are cyclical in nature and do not represent permanent change to the structure of the market in the sense that when markets settle we expect securitisation to pick up again

3949321 both fox sports and the league see this agreement as a stepping stone to a longer term deal and we are grateful for fox sports continued support of basketball while we undertake the major restructure of the nbl
3949322 given the fact that we are currently undergoing a major review of our entire sport that is expected to see the face of the nbl change considerably in season 2009 10 this is a vote of confidence by fox sports in the future of our sport

3949370 its been a long long journey so long that a whole book was written about a part of it its obvious to anyone who is familiar with the story and the history that it is one of the project that to make an understatement did not turn out the way it was originally planned
3949371 if you view it from the point of view as something that would replace outlook and exchange it has completely and utterly failed
3949372 last january i reached the conclusion that i was really ready and needing to go on to other things and the team on the project had a really strong desire to see it through to competition the team shrank in size pretty dramatically then i put a little more money into it in order to enable this transition to happen in 2008 part of which was they were going to ship 1 0
3949373 you asked if chandler has lived up to the dream i had six years ago and i think the fair answer to that is in part yes and in part no what has actually been delivered delivers on part of what the original dream was theres a cross platform fully open source innovative personal information manager with a very strong calendar those were among the original goals obviously its taken dramatically longer than i thought it would which i would attribute to not good judgment about how long it would take or the complexity of the project
3949374 its more of a conventional open source project in the sense that its momentum hereon is going to depend on the extent there is a community of volunteers who find it valuable enough to contribute to it and move it forward
3949375 the short answer is i dont know but there are promising signs the numbers of people involved while modest are non trivial and growing if you view it from the point of view as something that would replace outlook and exchange it has completely and utterly failed but from the point of view of having built something that tens of thousands of people are happily using and were using before there was a 1 0 by those metrics its pretty promising
3949376 well yeah actually its easy when youve been successful to lose calibration about what you can accomplish about how hard it can be about how long it will take theres lots of people on the second time around that have dug themselves into one or another kind of hole part of what allowed chandler to get traction and to get to 1 0 was when people on the project myself included where able to have more modest objectives to have more realistic planning and to get into a more agile cycle of development on the principle it is far better to deliver something than it is to have huge dreams and deliver nothing that would be my advice
3949377 cuz its not like we dont already kinda know this
3949378 that anyone could come into the school after hours and take advantage of defenceless animals that have been lovingly cared for by our students is disappointing

3949555 it is impossible to estimate too largely the work that the lord will accomplish through his proposed vessels in carrying out his mind and purpose the things you have described as taking place in indiana the lord has shown me would take place just before the close of probation every uncouth thing will be demonstrated there will be shouting with drums music and dancing the senses of rational beings will become so confused that they cannot be trusted to make right decisions and this is called the moving of the holy spirit the holy spirit never reveals itself in such methods in such a bedlam of noise this is an invention of satan to cover up his ingenious methods for making of none effect the pure sincere elevating ennobling sanctifying truth for this time better never have the worship of god blended with music than to use musical instruments to do the work which last january was represented to me would be brought into our camp meetings the truth for this time needs nothing of this kind in its work of converting souls a bedlam of noise shocks the senses and perverts that which if conducted aright might be a blessing the powers of satanic agencies blend with the din and noise to have a carnival and this is termed the holy spirits working
3949556 appearance of a catholic procession one bore in his hand a cross
3949557 unsanctified ministers are arraying themselves against god they are praising christ and the god of this world in the same breath let the son of deceit and false witness be entertained by a church that has had great light great evidence and that church will discard the message the lord has sent and receive the most unreasonable assertions and false suppositions and false theories satan laughs at their folly for he knows what truth is many will stand in our pulpits with the torch of false prophecy in their hands kindled from the hellish torch of satan if doubts and unbelief are cherished the faithful ministers will be removed from the people who think they know so much
3949558 the people turned upon their ministers with bitter hate and reproached them saying you have not warned us you told us that all the world was to be converted and cried peace peace to quiet every fear that was aroused you have not told us of this hour and those who warned us of it you declared to be fanatics and evil men who would ruin us but i saw that the ministers did not escape the wrath of god their suffering was tenfold greater than that of their people
3949559 but what is the image to the beast and how is it to be formed when the early church became corrupted by departing from the simplicity of the gospel and accepting heathen rites and customs she lost the spirit and power of god and in order to control the consciences of the people she sought the support of the secular power the result was the papacy a church that controlled the power of the state and employed it to further her own ends especially for the punishment of heresy in order for the united states to form an image of the beast the religious power must so control the civil government that the authority of the state will also be employed by the church to accomplish her own ends
3949560 there will be a hatred kindled against the testimonies which is satanic the workings of satan will be to unsettle the faith of the churches in them for this reason satan cannot have so clear a track to bring in his deceptions and bind up souls in his delusions if the warnings and reproofs and counsels of the spirit of god are heeded letter 40 1890
3949561 ye have done worse than they i saw that god has given his servants the truth so clear so plain that it cannot be resisted wherever they go they have certain victory their enemies cannot get round the convincing truth light has been shed so clear that the servants of god can stand up anywhere and let truth clear and connected bear away the victory this great blessing has not been prized or even realized
3949562 israel was a cumberer of the ground its very existence was a curse for it filled the place in the vineyard that a fruitful tree might fill it robbed the world of the blessings that god designed to give the israelites had misrepresented god among the nations they were not merely useless but a decided hindrance to a great degree their religion was misleading and wrought ruin instead of salvation
3949563 a blessing if ye obey the commandments of the lord your god which i command you this day and a curse if ye will not obey the commandments of the lord your god but turn aside out of the way which i command you this day to go after other gods which ye have not known
3949564 god will use ways and means by which it will be seen that he is taking the reins in his own hands the workers will be surprised by the simple means that he will use to bring about and perfect his work of righteousness
3949565 as the time comes for the loud cry to be given the lord will work through humble instruments leading the minds of those who consecrate themselves to his service the laborers will be qualified rather by the unction of his spirit than by the training of literary institutions men of faith and prayer will be constrained to go forth with holy zeal declaring the words which god gives them
3949566 for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works
3949567 even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and i will return unto you saith the lord of hosts but ye said wherein shall we return
3949568 look into yourself and examine your reactions to persons and situations and you will be appalled to discover the prejudiced thinking behind your reactions it is almost never the concrete reality of this person or thing that you are responding to you are responding to principles ideologies belief systems economic political religious psychological belief systems to preconceived ideas and prejudices whether positive or negative take them one at a time each person and thing and situation and search for your bias separating the reality here before you from your programmed perceptions and your projections and this exercise will afford you a revelation as divine as any that the scriptures could provide you with
3949569 we were not surprised by the fine performance of the liege side we had seen enough of them to know they were a good aggressive side
3949570 the real surprise for me was the way liverpool played the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
3949571 we will have to be a lot better in the second leg at anfield much better
3949572 we have been playing well in pre season looking confident and passing the ball well
3949573 but we did not do any of those things i did not want to bring steven gerrard on because the doctors had told me he was not fit enough to start the match
3949574 we waited until well into the second half before using him but we were not controlling the game and i had to bring him on
3949575 this game was far more difficult than we expected and jose reina was the man of the match
3949576 we know we can always rely on pepe to stop penalties but we have been told that the other effort may have been behind the line but these things happen
3949577 liverpool maybe came here asleep and not expecting this sort of game
3949578 maybe though we have woken them up for the second leg which will me much harder for us
3949579 we felt that if we did not lose this first leg we would still be in with a chance we know though that we still have to score and that could be the problem
3949580 but i want to praise my team they attacked liverpool from the start and when their goalkeeper pulled the ball back from behind the line maybe the referee was asleep too
3949581 no me toques los cojones que te meto un rayo por el culo
3949582 global statements about the psychological impact of abortion can be misleading
3949583 i believe that we can only achieve political stability by adopting an approach of reconciliation not confrontation i ask all political figures to adopt an approach of reconciliation
3949584 we have to save our economy we have to stop this capital flight the dollar was stable for the past eight years now it has risen high those investors who once used to queue up at our door have gone away we must bring them back we must also combat extremism and terrorism the only way we can do this is if the nation gets behind the army
3949585 the european union has this body which addresses perceived violations of the european human rights convention mr mckinnon believes his rights under that convention have been violated by the u k rulings
3949586 mr mckinnon has never been classified in that manner or treated in that manner as far as im aware
3949587 he will be treated as a normal criminal defendant in the civil court system of this country hes a run of the mill criminal with a run of the mill crime
3949588 at this point and time theres no indication the european court will give any credibility to his argument
3949589 it would be premature for him to believe that he has found a sympathetic shoulder to cry on for all the reasons he didnt prevail in the u k he shouldnt prevail there enough already mr mckinnon

3949591 but being in marketing we thought we would write an email afterward to let the proporietors know then they would have a chance to improve their service
3949592 people may have been concerned that i wouldnt have the funds to bring in players but thats not the case we are actively pursuing players as we speak
3949593 it has been a difficult week in many respects but it has happened very early in my tenure and from this point onwards we can move on and work much better
3949594 there have been misunderstandings but its also true to say that in any organisation if you make big changes on occasions messages will be misinterpreted and mistakes will be made
3949595 i had a meeting with the players to make the group aware that im in charge and will make the decisions that affect the players
3949596 if players leave or if they go that decision will be mine and mine solely thats where we are and i think everybody understands now that that is the situation i think we will be better for it and we can now move forward
3949597 we cant really go into the details of the owners position because if we are truthful we dont know which way it is going to go
3949598 but i was aware of this situation before i came here
3949599 i stay focused on my highest priorities and dont worry about what isnt getting done since its not my highest priority
3949600 i relieve my stress by exercising every morning i also make sure my assistant schedules me in a hotel with an excellent fitness center when im on the road i stayed at a westin last week that had a treadmill in the room
3949601 spending time with my family including weekends at our second home on the lake helps me unwind its good to be in a different environment away from the everyday hustle and bustle
3949602 my mind can usually see things worse than they are i daily need to anchor my thinking in reality not fear of what might happen
3949603 dont expect me to lie dont expect me to die for me
3949604 wish i could stop and chat but im mad late already

3949607 do not let anyone tell you that you are not better than them because you are
3949608 you have mercilessly beaten out your friends your brothers your sisters and every one you have loved
3949609 you have deserved this you are hitler the fourth alexander the great the second napoleon the fifth here to destroy the world we know
3949610 joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
3949611 the democrats in the senate are in a tough spot they have 51 votes joe lieberman organizes with them
3949612 in 85 days or something they will have five more democrats they wont need him to make the majority and it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does at that point in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
3949613 are you strong enough to live with out them are you strong enough to stop crying

3949664 so long as the interest of the whole society requires it that it so long as the established government cannot be resisted or changed without public inconveniencey it is the will of god that the established government be obeyed and no longer this principle being admitted the justice of every particular case of resistance is reduced to a computation of the quantity of the danger and grievance on the one side and of the probability and expense of redressing it on the other
3949665 a drab of stat a cloth o silver slut to have her train borne up and her soul trail in the dirt
3949666 i should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves or to march to mexico see if i would go
3949667 if you really wish to do anything resign your office
3949668 render therefore to caesar that which is caesars and to god those things which are gods
3949669 if a state is governed by the principles of reason poverty and misery are subjects of shame if a state is not governed by the principles of reason riches and honors are subjects of shame
3949670 know all men by these presents that i henry thoreau do not wish to be regarded as a member of any society which i have not joined
3949671 they accuse me of burning a barn but i never did it
3949672 we must affect our country as our parents and if at any time we alienate out love or industry from doing it honor we must respect effects and teach the soul matter of conscience and religion and not desire of rule or benefit
3949673 and never propose to make an effort i have never countenanced an effort and never mean to countenance an effort to disturb the arrangement as originally made by which various states came into the union
3949674 because it was part of the original compact let it stand

3949682 our main focus is to make this a lot of fun for people of all ages
3949683 ive always believed in giving back to the community with our annual comic book camp and now with this convention we hope to continue that tradition we had over 1 500 people at the last convention so we needed to up the production this year
3949684 were all used to seeing pictures of melting ice caps and polar bears and thinking about rising sea levels but we dont see pictures of melting glaciers in the himalayas
3949685 if the government appears zealous on the climate change issue it is with good reason
3949686 the fear factor over climate change is not the main message
3949687 the main message is that it is cheaper to cut energy use if you want to get the price of fuel down then go green
3949688 it was hugely encouraging to see john mccain endorse a cap and trade plan which means all three candidates now support the idea
3949689 the good news is the us election and the fact that the chinese government is part of the solution and not part of the problem
3949690 the chinese economy might be part of the problem but the chinese government gets this issue not least because of the damage climate change and pollution is doing to their country
3949691 although two years may seem like it is a long way off in business planning terms it is not
3949692 every half hourly meter in the country will be written to as part of a reconciliation process to determine whether it is above the threshold or not
3949693 those sites that will win will be well organised with their data will know whether they are in or outside the scheme and are planning now
3949694 agriculture has land as a resource organic waste and the ability to grow crops for biofuels
3949695 all industries can benefit from renewable energy but agriculture is certainly very well placed
3949696 these projects would be very profitable and would deliver returns on investment within around five years
3949697 we also found these types of initiatives really resonated with customers many of whom felt that this was the type of thing supermarkets should be doing already
3949698 an anaerobic digestor at a pack house can use all the left over waste material to provide energy and also charge gate fees for waste material from other sites
3949699 the technology also generates two units of heat for every one unit of electricity so feasibly a firm could use that heat through an absorption chiller to cool the facilitys refrigerators or alternatively co locate a greenhouse on the site which would then use the waste heat
3949700 keep the world still in darkness to the intent they might sit in the consciences of the people
3949701 its true that consumer understanding of the figure was not high but that is exactly where youd expect it to be at the start of the story
3949702 also all our quantitative and qualitative research showed that while they may still be unfamiliar with the figures customers welcomed the information being there
3949703 the process allowed us to identify hot spots within the supply chain
3949704 for example we were able to uncover one supplier whose refrigeration units were far less efficient than those of a rival and were therefore able to work with them to rectify that
3949705 every capital expenditure and business decision is now looked at through the lens of the push to reduce co2 over the next two years
3949706 we were told this would cost us 50 000 per product but the cost is now down to 2 500 per product and falling
3949707 i dont want companies telling me that if i wash my hair with cold water that will lower the shampoos carbon footprint
3949708 we have to ask if all meat products will go into the g band or if beef goes in the g band and chicken goes in a lower band or if just the most carbon intensive beef goes in the g band with other beef products going elsewhere
3949709 i see no reason why the court shouldnt act in accordance with the wishes of the parties judge emmett said
3949710 why wont you talk to me usually you talk to me why are you being so mean

3949713 we have you tapped to come back and work with the new firm when its finished rebuilding on earth
3949714 come on gavin were going to go fuck with lindsey and fuck lindsey
3949715 hows that go again your woman your dog and your ford pick up truck
3949716 arent you looking fine i hardly noticed that your heads not on straight
3949717 or more accurately fuck me because i can get you out of here
3949718 this was one more effective way for us to communicate with folks who may not normally see other communications we have with voters who are paying closer attention to the race
3949719 it is a first i guess they are going after the insomniac vote
3949720 the groups result reflected good contributions from a number of large construction projects in australia and the gulf another solid property development performance and the contract mining of iron ore and coal in australia and indonesia chief executive wal king said
3949721 the groups outlook remains strong for the 2009 financial year sustained by a record level of work in hand
3949722 infrastructure investment is forecast to stay at historically high levels fuelled by major funding commitments from the federal and state governments mr king said
3949723 the resources market is expected to remain strong for the group fuelled by international demand for iron ore and coal
3949724 fuelled by petrodollars the gulf is enjoying a construction boom which should continue to offer the habtoor leighton group numerous opportunities
3949725 results on the asx are okay this morning and if companies meet expectations the market will give them the benefit of the doubt at least for the time being
3949726 unless things deteriorate significantly from there then they wouldnt be making adjustments so far mr hung said
3949727 funding costs for the banks across all sources had probably fallen by about 25 to 30 basis points in recent weeks he told a federal parliamentary committee hearing in sydney
3949728 people have been pushing the banks to give more commitment to the fact that they would follow the reserve bank when the reserve bank cuts interest rates
3949729 the banks have responded to that quite cautiously and have been quite non committal
3949730 my guess is really whats happening here is the banks are saying well its unreasonable for them to give commitments when they dont know when the rba is going to move or by how much
3949731 thats why we now find we are in a position to cut interest rates mr battellino added
3949732 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late mr battellino said
3949733 overall when we look at all the evidence which we have its reasonable to conclude that the australian financial sector is competitive and that it stacks up quite well across a range of international benchmarks
3949734 our view is that these recent events are cyclical in nature and do not represent permanent change to the structure of the market in the sense that when markets settle we expect securitisation to pick up again mr battellino said
3949735 for many organisations electricity bills are just one per cent of operational costs so putting additional financial costs on them through the crc does not necessarily change much
3949736 the reputational element attached to the league table will be the driver for change
3949737 someone has to come bottom and some companies will perform badly
3949738 even if they perform quite well and cut emissions they might still have performed worse than everybody else
3949739 within hours of the league table being published for the first time were going to know the best and worst diy chains the best and worst pub chains and so on
3949740 there will be these sub league tables within the overall league table and as such we shouldnt underestimate the reputational risk factor
3949741 we face a tough market in the year ahead but we are well placed to withstand these conditions with a proven business model clear strategy and sound property skills managing director matthew quinn said
3949742 we are budgeting for a nominal increase in earnings per security in financial year 2009 but it is going to be tough and we are assuming that market conditions do not deteriorate further
3949743 looking through the current cycle we expect to achieve higher earnings per security growth from financial year 2010 onwards
3949744 we have seen a steep decline in confidence in the australian reit real estate investment trust sector in recent months and were disappointed to have been impacted he said
3949745 we are intent on restoring confidence through our focus on value creation for our security holders and our sound balance sheet puts us in a good position to do so
3949746 our residential business also performed well despite deteriorating buyer sentiment and our ability to once again grow profits through a tough residential cycle demonstrates the quality and diversity of our business said mr quinn
3949747 active asset management and low occupancy costs should enable us to deliver further operational upside despite the recent slowdown in consumer spending mr quinn said
3949748 we remain of the view that the medium term prospects for the australian residential market are favourable due to high immigration and significant supply constraints mr quinn said
3949749 we can have you on a plane to milan in twenty minutes
3949750 any designer you want next seasons line a week at bacara if you want it say the word its yours

3949813 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3949814 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3949815 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3949816 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3949821 parents and children should see their relationship as one of shared responsibilities to strengthen values which are important in developing character
3949822 children being children are susceptible to making wrong decisions when influenced by their peers if parents or guardians leave them on their own for too long
3949823 the reported cases highlighted in the media involving deaths of children and sexual abuse should be a cause for alarm the safety and care of children must be top priority in the family and communities collectively we must step up on this important responsibility
3949824 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3949825 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3949826 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3949827 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3949828 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3949829 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3949830 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3949837 our dependence on automobiles especially in the suburbs is a concern of mine not only because it only perpetuates the breakdown of localism but also because of the negative effect it has on the environment and ultimately because i believe god has given us a wonderful gift creation as well as us the responsibility to care for it

3949850 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3949851 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

3949856 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3949857 i see no reason why the court shouldnt act in accordance with the wishes of the parties judge emmett said
3949858 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership

3949860 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3949861 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3949862 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3949863 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3949864 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3949865 who are open to doing something on the production side
3949866 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3949867 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3949868 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3949869 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3949870 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3949871 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3949872 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3949873 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3949874 the first defendant and the second defendant were notified of the listing today

3949883 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3949884 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3949885 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3949886 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3949887 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3949888 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3949889 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3949890 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3949891 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3949892 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3949893 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3949894 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3949895 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3949896 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3949897 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3949898 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3949899 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3949900 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3949901 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3949902 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3949903 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3949904 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3949905 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3949906 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3949907 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3949908 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3949909 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3949910 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3949911 long has our nation the united states of america kept the forces of chaos at bay
3949912 by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe
3949913 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3949914 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3949915 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3949916 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3949917 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3949918 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3949919 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3949920 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3949921 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3949922 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3949923 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

3949925 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3949926 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3949927 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3949928 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3949929 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3949930 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3949931 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3949932 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3949933 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3949934 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3949935 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3949936 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3949937 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3949938 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3949939 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3949940 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3949941 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3949942 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3949943 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3949944 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3949945 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3949946 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3949947 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3949948 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3949949 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
