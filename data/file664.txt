6640001 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
6640002 one desire has been the ruling passion of my life one high motive has acted like a spur upon my mind and soul and sooner should i seek escape from the sacred necessity that is laid upon me let the breath of life fail me it is this that in spite of all worldly opposition gods holy ordinances shall be established again in the home in the school and in the state for the good of the people to carve as it were into the conscience of the nation the ordinances of the lord to which the bible and creation bear witness until the nation pays homage again to god
6640003 the capitals are betting that the old theodore is back and we agree the upside with theodore behind this emerging capitals team really is quite astronomical he looked every bit the hart trophy winner he was in montreal the capitals have all puck daddy found this 2 days ago on
6640004 perhaps the first thing we must take from the fall of a leader is the fact that the frailty of the messenger does not negate the authority or truth of the message

6640013 when you have to teach sophomores how to convert fractions and decimals its sad
6640014 we havent ignored the traditional base of manufacturing there are jobs out there for people who retrain and take their skill set to a higher level and were trying to help with that
6640015 it fits into what we need to do toward training our young people for the next generation of jobs sometimes there are jobs out there but there arent people with the skills to do them

6640032 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting
6640033 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
6640034 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
6640035 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
6640036 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
6640037 i have been truly blessed over the last few years it hasnt been a long time
6640038 i mean before i wrote this book or before this book started selling about four years ago you know we were living in a condo myself michelle and our two girls
6640039 and we you know had two cars but one of them was kind of beat up and we didnt have a garage so youd have to in chicago you gotta shovel your car out of the snow and scrape the ice
6640040 and we didnt know how we were going to afford college education for our kids cause we had been paying down student loans for ten years between the two of us
6640041 so the idea that i have to pay the same tax rate as the waitress over at shoneys whos making maybe 16 18 20 000 a year when the truth is that the extra 2 or 3 that im paying by rolling the bush tax cuts i wont really notice but for her would allow to her get an extra 1 000 or 1500 or 2000 that would allow her to maybe buy a new coat for her kids or to get a new computer that they could work on
6640042 i know all the girls and the coaches its my home state all of my family and friends will get to see me play
6640043 i think ameera has shown herself to be a very complete player
6640044 i think the biggest difference between this year and years past is that shes a senior and were going to rely on her to be a leader both on the field and vocally
6640045 that he so confidently descants on the second rateness of various works of eliot yeats lawrence etc
6640046 and you withywindle who so confidently descants on the second rateness of orwell what does that make you
6640047 my friend can your heart stand the shocking facts about grave robbers from outer space
6640048 duh whats this coal stuff my boss keeps talking about
6640049 were in but we havent finished our business yet we havent completed the task
6640050 were close to clinching the division and thats what we want the playoffs is not really what we want we expected to be there clinching the division thats pretty nice
6640051 i think being fresh going into the playoffs is important i felt that a j needed a day off today lets face it hes been in there every day coronas been in there every day penas coming back maybe as early as tomorrow so i think theres an opportunity to give some guys some time off and i think its going to do them worlds of good a day off here and there never hurts anybody a couple days off never hurts anybody its a heck of a grind to go from april all the way to this point in the season
6640052 right now its going to remain the same but as we get nearer to the playoffs were going to try to start to set some things up as far as who we want to start game one and game two and so on
6640053 weve talked about it but theres nothing set in stone yet but you never know who youre going to have and who youre going to lose
6640054 at this point of the year it doesnt really matter im just looking forward to pitching in the playoffs
6640055 i only got one inning of mop up last year im just hoping to have a shot to make a difference this time around at this point last year i was put in the pen and i didnt get a chance to throw a whole lot i just want to get into the playoffs and throw the ball well
6640056 none of those situations are easy those at bats with the game on the line
6640057 but theyre situations you want to be in being up in that situation a couple times this year has definitely made it a little easier just having some success as well as failure in that situation makes it a little easier to handle mentally
6640058 ellos est n interesados en que venga una flota por los mares por el caribe por el oc ano atl ntico ellos nos han pedido apoyo y nosotros le vamos a dar apoyo a rusia para que llegue aqu a puerto venezolano a intercambiar con nosotros
6640059 es indudablemente cierto que los negociadores han llevado esto muy muy cerca de finalizar con un acuerdo pero no hay ninguna raz n para pensar que ya hay un acuerdo o que va a haberlo hoy
6640060 pero tendr una oportunidad con el primer ministro para saber en verdad si hay alguna brecha que tenemos que cerrar en washington
6640061 su mutuo populismo econ mico y particularmente en su antipat a hacia el libre comercio
6640062 nos hemos reunido con los representantes de la cadena wal mart y nos han manifestado que desean invertir en comercio en el pa s y esto es interesante porque quieren entrar al tema de supermercados y centros comerciales ligados al turismo lo que ayudar a a expandir nuestros servicios
6640063 the hospitals security video recorded sabocks care from april 28 when he choked on his medicine while a nurse stood by without helping him and through his day without food until his death from a heart problem
6640064 it went very very smoothly and professionally the whale suffered as little as possible
6640065 the internet was created by the united states of america
6640066 it cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded not by religionists but
6640067 done in convention by the unanimous consent of the states present the seventeenth day of september in the
6640068 of all the animosities which have existed among mankind those which are caused by difference of sentiments in religion appear to be the most inveterate and distressing and ought most to be deprecated
6640069 the women athletes we had in these olympics were in total compliance with the age requirement
6640070 since asian bodies are not the same as westerners there have been questions but there shouldnt be
6640071 given that there have been some discrepancies regarding her age that have come to light we have asked the fig to look into this matter
6640072 it is because of these discrepancies that we have asked for this investigation to start
6640073 the chinese gymnastics association registered its athletes in complete compliance with the requirement of the international gymnastics federation
6640074 please please help us we are losing our treasure our freedom i am almost crying because im seeing my country is falling
6640075 states are applying ever more fine grained methods to limit and shape the information environment to which their citizens have access
6640076 some states block access to a wide swathe of content while others tend to concentrate on one or two narrow baskets south korea for example tends to block access only to sites related to north korea
6640077 filtering can help shape the message a countrys citizens see including as may have happened recently when georgia filtered some russian web sites for the purpose of preventing enemy propaganda from reaching ones citizens
6640078 filtering isnt the primary technological way that internet freedom can be compromised
6640079 another type of cyberwarfare that occurs more regularly is hacking into computers and stealing information as well as planting trojans or viruses
6640080 they range from the electronic frontier foundations torsoftware to commercial anonymizers and virtual private networks and buddy system software like psiphon which allows a person in one place to handle requests for web sites from someone in a place that filters
6640081 the alleged assaults took place in a tiny space occupied by three people and that while the complainant testified she screamed the friend heard nothing
6640082 mr hnidan and mr marriot conducted themselves in a competent professional fair objective impartial and ethical manner in good faith in the honest discharge of their duties
6640083 at all times det glasgows actions were motivated by her desire to diligently faithfully and to the best of her ability fulfil her duties and obligations as a police officer
6640084 the defendants maliciously recklessly and intentionally abused the process of the court by proceeding with the prosecution with reckless indifference to the guilt or innocence of the accused
6640085 but the judges reasons said nothing further about the friends evidence or the exculpatory effects of large parts of her evidence
6640086 n o se dirijam aos gentios nem entrem em cidade alguma dos samaritanos

6640091 we finally got the right combination of ingredients partly by accident
6640092 ours is behaving in a similar way were actually looking okay he said
6640093 its been led mainly by the resources the banks were lagging and now the banks have picked up
6640094 the trading environment is worse than yesterday as the yen became stronger and oil prices rose sharply
6640095 lingering worries about the global economy including japan are also weighing on the market
6640096 we think the start of the recession will be pinned down to november last year which means that as long as this is just a normal cyclical recession the bottom for stocks could come very soon
6640097 when the rich wage war its the poor who die
6640098 rush hour 3 as dani reese charlies skeptical and demanding partner brent sexton hbos
6640099 frankly its surprising that life was even renewed for a new season but now that the show is relegated to friday night at 10 itll be even more surprising if it lives to see the end of the second season
6640100 dream no small dreams for they have no power to move the hearts of men
6640101 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6640102 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6640103 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6640104 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6640105 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6640106 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition

6640109 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison

6640127 the engineer is the type of guy who brings a gun to a sword fight
6640128 its had a couple of rallies up toward these levels and its just failed mr vrondas said
6640129 i think todays move is just a little bit of profit taking really
6640130 if we see some demand for euro against the us dollar when europe steps in then that will probably help the aussie mr vrondas said
6640131 it appears as though the market is still relatively buoyed at the moment on the back of the performance in commodities
6640132 we might see a bit more of a pullback in the us dollar
6640133 this test proves that the matmor process works with sub bituminous coal in addition to the already confirmed lignite and produces an ideal feedstock for the likes of secondary steel and iron production using electric arc or induction furnaces
6640134 we can now work towards offering a process that allows china india and other countries to use their previously sub commercial resources to make steel and iron
6640135 we dont expect the situation to deteriorate but we would be remiss in our duty not have a plan in place in the event the situation did deteriorate
6640136 if however the airport at nadi was closed then we would have to consider whether a military evacuation by air or by sea was necessary
6640137 we would work with what ever government was in place in fiji to try to get their concurrence if that was not possible then in the last instance the lives and the well being of our citizens would be paramount and we would do it with or without that concurrence
6640138 is if you just use you bob and you bob as caricatures the truth is both of you acknowledge the world is more complicated
6640139 the economy has changed in the last 15 years and our understanding of economic policy has changed as well
6640140 and that means that what was appropriate in 1993 is no longer appropriate
6640141 i still would have probably made a slightly different choice than clinton did
6640142 i probably wouldnt have been as obsessed with deficit reduction
6640143 she had to think very practically about how do you make money
6640144 how does the system work that led me to have an orientation to ask hardheaded questions during my formative years there was still ideological competition between a social democratic or even socialist agenda and a free market milton friedman agenda i think it was natural for me to ask questions of both sides and maybe try to synthesize approaches
6640145 reagans central insight that the liberal welfare state had grown complacent and overly bureaucratic with democratic policy makers more obsessed with slicing the economic pie than with growing that pie contained a good deal of truth
6640146 i like to think of him as a university of chicago democrat
6640147 ive never worked with a campaign that was more interested in what the research shows
6640148 this could be one of the biggest pieces of corporate welfare ever
6640149 the market is the best mechanism ever invented for efficiently allocating resources to maximize production
6640150 and i also think that there is a connection between the freedom of the marketplace and freedom more generally
6640151 weve probably done a better job of the last 20 years on the problems the market can solve than the problems the market cant solve were doing pretty well on the size of peoples houses and televisions and the like were not looking so good on infrastructure and education
6640152 the free market centrism of the clinton years to a revived push for european style social democracy
6640153 this is in many respects a deeply un american solution to the problems facing our country
6640154 one that would emphasize dependence over self sufficiency and bureaucratic condescension over self help
6640155 if you talk to warren hell tell you his preference is not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
6640156 that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end
6640157 i do think that what the argument may miss is the sense of control that we want individuals to have in determining their own career paths making their own life choices and so forth and i also think you want to instill that sense of self reliance and that what you do will help determine outcomes
6640158 we all talk about apollo 11 but there were some pretty public pretty awful failures along the way
6640159 the united states didnt say well we had some failures
6640160 now thats the story now telling it elegantly low taxes smaller government the way the republicans have i think is more of a challenge
6640161 one just because i think it really captures where i was going with the whole issue of balancing market sensibilities with moral sentiment one of my favorite quotes is you know that famous robert f kennedy quote about the measure of our g d p
6640162 well ill send it to you because its one of the most beautiful of his speeches
6640163 counts special locks for our doors and the jails for those who break them

6640166 this grouping of stores fits with our historical pattern of building a concentration of stores in new markets to leverage efficiencies in logistics marketing and management supervision
6640167 the company does not expect these stores to achieve profitability for several years but believes the opportunity presented by the whitehall jewelers acquisition was one which would enable michael hill international to enter this market on favourable terms

6640170 we are still clearing the highway and i am confident it will be open soon
6640171 we wanted to make sure that everyone feels comfortable and they can participate with dignity when they use our facilities i think its a tangible demonstration of our commitment to diversity to formalize the policy
6640172 we know that the industry is facing these acute challenges and i cant say with any certainty that there wont be further announcements in regard to job losses he told sky news
6640173 what were seeing here is the legacy of neglect from the previous government
6640174 this industry has been left on automatic pilot pretty much since 2002
6640175 every once in a while my sister in law would come over for a visit and because she and my wife look so similar id end up making love to her by mistake

6640179 the outlook going forward for 2009 were saying the market is a difficult market were saying the market conditions are probably the worst anyone has seen for a long period of time chief executive greg goodman said
6640180 but we are comfortable and confident of targeting eps growth in 2009 of 6 per cent and that is subject to no material deterioration in the market from where we sit at the moment
6640181 this result is largely due to organic growth mr goodman said
6640182 we have 371 investment properties under management and 97 developments globally giving us the benefit of significant geographic and earnings diversity
6640183 this has enabled us to navigate through a difficult period while no one can forecast when broader market conditions will improve we believe that our business is in good shape to operate through the current cycle
6640184 while there is understandable caution among retailers the world over we remain confident that our multi brand multi region business model will deliver healthy growth and our forward orders support this view
6640185 a very pleasing result in any climate let alone in the prevailing economic conditions
6640186 this again demonstrates the resilience of our business model and the heightened global demand for the groups brands
6640187 behind the pants the making of let me start by saying that this
6640188 ask your mama or your dada to tell you about the eh schism between minimalism and cubism
6640189 everytime we see each other well give each other hugs
6640190 that was really the only suspicious thing about the letter and our national headquarters advised out of an abundance of caution for our staff and volunteers that we have the authorities check it out
6640191 pancada justi a injusti a isso vai ter mas nunca precisei puxar o saco de ningu m
6640192 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6640193 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6640194 will be in a significantly stronger financial position and will have the resources to develop a strong international in market presence
6640195 the vast majority of these fall to silver fern farms or directly to supplier shareholders the report said
6640196 grant samuel believes a positive outcome of the proposed transaction is that the interests of pggw and silver fern farms will be closely aligned
6640197 the proposed transaction will increase silver fern farms equity to in excess of 500 million and transform silver fern farms from being an undercapitalised company with limited scope to undertake new capital projects or pursue acquisitions to the financially strongest company in the new zealand meat processing industry

6640200 my favourite singer is christina aguilera i love her voice and her current album stripped she has some great songs and lyrics and i have always looked up to jennifer lopez she seems so sure of herself and always seems to have a good time
6640201 i never wear anything random i m very conscious about my apperance

6640208 we have so far seen a lot of people gunning for the mmd presidency and this is likely to intensify after the period of mourning there are too many camps in the mmd backing different candidates so if someone goes through whom the other camps do not approve of we foresee a situation where there will be a lot of bickering and in fighting which may destablise the country
6640209 ultimately the stability of the country will depend on how the mmd will handle the issue of finding president mwanawasas successor
6640210 a serious blot on the culture of democracy in our sub region
6640211 the death of president mwanawasa is a very big blow to the development of the country especially to the fight against corruption president mwanawasa was very passionate and resolute about the fight against corruption zambians will greatly miss him for that
6640212 his death leaves a big hole not only in the ruling mmd but also in the country and southern africa as a region
6640213 president mwanawasa laid a good foundation for economic stability and growth what we need now is a leadership that will build on the foundation he laid if its to change in any way it can be only for the better our policies remain favourable to all investors

6640216 the three factor model is as fama and french have repeatedly emphasized only a model it is not reality
6640217 after almost three months on the road i was craving an easy low key weekend of cozy conviviality
6640218 but when i ventured outside i felt like a country bumpkin on his first trip to the big city gawking at everything from the tall narrow buildings in the 17th century style of philips vingboons in the 17th century to the tall pretty girls riding bicycles and talking on cellphones at the same time of course it had only been six weeks since i left rome but that short time in the provinces a knife dangling from my belt my thumb extended to catch a ride my eyes and ears alert for double dealing taxi drivers had transformed me in amsterdam i crossed bike lanes with caution and was wary of all who approached me i was a yokel
6640219 but as i followed in the footsteps of the original 18th century grand tourists and made my way back to the british isles i knew i had one last opportunity to expand my cultural horizons even as the sun was setting on my journey
6640220 thats almost a 75 percent increase over that period of time
6640221 we are doing everything we can but a bunch of it is out of our control
6640222 we just knew october was the time for tvas quarterly reviews
6640223 its a challenging time for customers in all respects but i dont believe im capable of passing judgement on to tva and their processes
6640224 we try to run kub and deal with the hand were dealt
6640225 weve got our work cut out for us and our employees understand that
6640226 they came to me and said that they had a piece of information that the scorpions had a meeting to counter the polokwane proposal they told me they got the information from their own sources
6640227 i initially wanted to deny knowledge but it became clear they had detailed information
6640228 my affidavit was a top secret document meant for the national security council and obtained to corroborate the information they apparently had in their possession
6640229 i was assured of the secrecy of the document it was not meant for mr selebi and i cant explain why and how selebi got access to the document maybe the national security council may help you in this regard
6640230 my instructions at the time i made this affidavit were that i must not disclose its contents or the contents of any other matter where i assisted the national security council to anyone and i do not intend doing so even now
6640231 i favor the pristine and classic all u s stock market and all bond market approach
6640232 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged
6640233 the three factor model is as fama and french have repeatedly emphasized only a model it is not reality
6640234 i never attempt to make money on the stock market i buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years
6640235 unless you can watch your stock holding decline by 50 without becoming panic stricken you should not be in the stock market
6640236 unless you can watch your stock holding decline by 50 without becoming panic stricken you should not be in the stock market
6640237 one of the most important things that we stress is that parents and educators need to deal with small problems when theyre small problems and make sure they defuse and de escalate
6640238 school officials need to be out in the hallways in the cafeterias not only just supervising but interacting because often kids will tell adults that they trust
6640239 the no 1 way we find out about weapons in school is students tell an adult that they trust
6640240 at any school the students and the staff all should feel wanted feel safe and feel successful
6640241 one of the easiest ways to prevent guns is to require people to tuck their shirts in you can hide so much in baggy pants and under sweatshirts
6640242 why did the alleged assailant bring the gun there mostly a gun is carried in school for one of two reasons for protection or to show off
6640243 the first line of defense is always a well trained highly alert staff and student body
6640244 he acted like the teasing didnt bother him but it did
6640245 he was joking with me and talking about his clothes i told him i loved him and to have a good day
6640246 to have the life he had its a wonder he wasnt crazy
6640247 sometimes you have to develop a shell or a shield to make it in this life
6640248 who would have guessed this would happen to him at school
6640249 as soon as the doctor came out of surgery i knew it was all over
6640250 he wanted to do something to help kids when he grew up he loved young kids he was a really good boy
6640251 its been demonstrated that local communities can always enact more stringent standards for signage than federal or state law
6640252 the reason for the collapse of world trade centre 7 is no longer a mystery
6640253 i kick myself for waiting as long as i did because weve enjoyed it so much
6640254 we took an old boxed up kitchen and made it all come together beautifully
6640255 i got to bring low voltage halogen workspace lighting into play which prevents shadows while youre cooking the entire transformation is like night and day
6640256 i am able to work around it really well as i move throughout the kitchen
6640257 we purchased our refrigerator early and plugged it in along with our microwave and toaster oven one night we were tired of frozen food and i couldnt get to my grill through the kitchen so i wheeled it onto the front porch the neighbors probably worried the couch would be next
6640258 you always hear that investing in your kitchen is money well spent ive really reaped the benefits i know if i tried to sell my house it would sell fairly quickly because of the new kitchen but i am enjoying it so much i dont want to move
6640259 we have had contact with the suspect and his family and we have had services workers in the home
6640260 he wasnt in our custody while he had some relatively minor charges im not seeing anything that indicates a violent history
6640261 we believe shes still in the nashville area we know she has attempted to get to chattanooga but presently we believe she is hiding out in public housing locations in the nashville area
6640262 im innocent im going to walk out of this place with my head held high
6640263 the outrage prior to the shooting that we were expressing and are still expressing was the indifference to the comments about safety and discipline or a lack of recognition that theres a problem
6640264 the problems were dismissed as anecdotal we believed theres a systemic problem
6640265 are so passionate about the way the school is run
6640266 im very proud to be a part of central high school
6640267 i still will be proud to be part of central high school
6640268 thursdays shooting comes on the backside of theres a discipline problem and youre not addressing it
6640269 this is one of those we told you so moments
6640270 some of the kids they dont adhere to any kind of rules
6640271 there are kids who habitually push others out of the lunch line to nick its extremely frustrating
6640272 a lot of people community leaders superintendent james mcintyre central high school administrators are going to be judged based on their response to this situation
6640273 would it have prevented a tragedy like today probably not
6640274 its been a very sad and devastating week for us who work here in knox county schools
6640275 my heart goes out to the parents of the students weve lost this week
6640276 are trained to be vigilant to watch and understand actions of students body language and those kinds of things
6640277 if we get into specifics of certain security arrangements it defeats the purpose of having those arrangements because it becomes widely known
6640278 whether or not it is we havent seen it now theres been problems but theres problems in every other school
6640279 its not like it used to be but i dont know a high school that is like it used to be
6640280 i thought somebody had just dropped a book or something
6640281 then he fell right behind me i turned around and saw him holding his hand to his chest when he fell his arm hit me in the back
6640282 when i saw the blood i thought it was fake i couldnt believe it that could have been me
6640283 i want to assure parents that despite this isolated incident our schools are safe
6640284 i dont think anyone could have anticipated a tragedy of this magnitude at central high school or at any of our schools
6640285 we have not nailed down the motive as of yet i dont know the extent of their contact
6640286 the officer observed him stopped him and located the weapon on him
6640287 he was looking around like he was looking for a teacher or something
6640288 in terms of what may have happened this morning those conversations havent even begun
6640289 im hopeful the state will decide not to seek a transfer to criminal court
6640290 i started loading kids into my car and i got them off campus as quickly as possible
6640291 i saw him go to the ground and start shaking
6640292 he was lying on the floor and blood was everywhere
6640293 so many people reached out to us now we want to reach out to them it was a good day to be running late
6640294 if this can be an aid to get us back in the games then so be it

6640300 there are a variety of providers in the area wait times are significant and not all the people we see have great mobility the idea that there will be additional health services is a plus
6640301 it got extremely busy here really quickly i didnt think in two years we would need another inner city facility

6640338 all programs kind of suffer if something goes wrong in the daily routine especially games which are held in the evenings
6640339 but on the final day of inspection we noticed some of the plates on the poles were off and we asked those questions to our people that did the job and they said it was on previously
6640340 a screw would hold that plate in place but now its tack welded

6640385 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6640386 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6640397 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw
6640398 our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons eugene justin and daniel gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side
6640399 before he cleans out his office have paul tagliabue show you where he keeps gene upshaws leash by making the docile head of the players union his personal pet your predecessor has kept the peace without giving players the kind of guarantees other pros take for granted try to make sure no one competent ever replaces upshaw on your watch
6640400 when you look at the issues and the recent round of cba negotiations and what actually happened ask the owners if they have gene on a leash or if they control gene ask them if theyre happy with the cba agreement and genes subservience
6640401 how many owners have come out and said they got the worse end of the deal when you know the truth about something and you hear the opposite enough times it really grates on you thats where im at
6640402 the consensus is that gene had his finest hour in the last cba negotiations robert smith said
6640403 i became the vikings player rep in part to get rid of gene smith said
6640404 everybody wants to focus on the nfl not having guaranteed contracts
6640405 it bothers me that that perception is still out there even if its a small number of people smith said
6640406 paul and i have had discussions about how people perceive us
6640407 we have a relationship where we can just sit down and talk without even talking about business we can talk about the history of the game about what hes been through what ive been through all of those things are why weve had success
6640408 probably the most important thing paul has done is kept us out of the courtroom he knew and i knew that if we stayed out of the courtroom and used the assets which is the players we could grow the game in a way that is unbelievable and thats whats happened
6640409 you just knew gene upshaw was eventually going to go on to something great
6640410 wed take trips to our capital at sacramento and id watch him moving among those politicians and just marvel sometimes sort of half kidding half serious i used to call him governor because thats what i always guessed hed be
6640411 when paul took over one of the first things he did was call me and said lets get together for dinner we met at a little washington d c restaurant up on columbia road from that point on thats been the difference
6640412 we have agreed on a lot of things and we have disagreed on a lot of things
6640413 its never been about either one of us trying to one up the other its always been what we can do to make our product better and to grow it if people dont understand that its their problem not ours
6640414 the beauty of the relationship is that we have a common interest in getting it out of the game whether its balco steroids whatever
6640415 we understand how delicate it is for our product to be in a situation where the fans dont show up because they have no confidence in the game when you look at the drug policy our players dont want it in the game when the baseball players dont want it in the game it will get out thats what happened with us this is the only area in which the football players basically gave the owners the right for random testing because they wanted it out of the game
6640416 he knows how to set his sights on his goal and pursue it relentlessly
6640417 he wanted a bigger piece of the pie for the players some of us took the position that revenue sharing might be good for league but its none of your business you know you just go ahead and make a labor deal
6640418 i think some people thought he was arguing but not really committed to the principle suddenly it started to dawn on people that the guy really means it over time he spoke with more and more owners
6640419 we have another 10 stadiums we still need to build
6640420 until we can get that done those teams arent going to grow minnesota oakland san francisco san diego that group at the bottom of the revenue scale are all in old stadiums ive been around long enough to remember when they opened all those stadiums and we thought they were great now theyre a piece of crap and need to be replaced
6640421 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man gene upshaws career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy we loved him and he loved us we will miss him our hearts go out to terri and the boys
6640422 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field
6640423 it is a sad day for the nfl but genes positive impact and legacy will live on for decades to come
6640424 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams
6640425 gene upshaw was a good friend an inspiring leader and a tireless and effective champion of players in the nfl i cant imagine a world without genes larger than life presence
6640426 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6640427 its not polite to speak ill of the dead and i hope his soul is at peace in heaven but he was a mean spirited man who disregarded the plight of many of his former colleagues who sought improved pension and medical benefits however he did a lot for the current players they owe their salaries to gene upshaw
6640428 people can say what they want to say about gene they didnt like him he was too brash he didnt stroke them the right way but gene always told you the truth gene got the job done when it boils down to it his legacy will go on forever
6640429 if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football in that he is obviously going to be missed he was respected by everyone because as a player he was a tough guy and as the union head he was a tough guy but he was also smart and he could compromise and he could make things happen
6640430 he always treated people with respect and dignity he always was able to keep things in perspective and maintained a positive attitude while he was a strong advocate for the players at the end of the day he really wanted to do what was right for the game
6640431 his union leadership has been one of the key factors to the exponential growth that the league and all of its players have enjoyed over the past two decades gene represented the players the way i would want to be represented with understanding integrity and a steadfast commitment to doing what was right for them and what was best for the game
6640432 after his long career as a player he dedicated his efforts to tirelessly working to improve the salaries benefits and working conditions of generations of nfl players we talked often about common issues and i will miss those conversations
6640433 i think he was a good guy you dont always have to agree with everything somebody does to respect them
6640434 i think any player who touched our game the last 20 years has been positively influenced by his leadership whether it be raising the minimums for rookies whether it be for veterans whether it be for retired players you name it you continue to look back over the last 20 years and hes done nothing but improve the game for players everybody can sit back and obviously some people might criticize some of the things hes done but overall i dont think you could have asked for a better leader
6640435 you wont find a better person in terms of taking care of former players than gene upshaw gene would do whatever is best for the players you hear all the older players who gripe and complain that we should have better this or better that they wouldnt have what they have today if not for gene upshaw

6640439 la fronda movimento di opposizione a mazarino prima in clandestinit e poi apertamente manifest tutto il risentimento dei francesi per la gravosit delle misure fiscali ed economiche imposte a seguito del perdurare della guerra dei trentanni
6640440 tendendo le orecchie nella comunit glbt romana si sente proprio rumore di fronda si avvicinano con repentine ed inspiegabili accelerazioni che parrebbero essere dettate dalla preoccupazione dellattuale dirigenza il congresso e le elezioni per il rinnovo degli organi sociali di arcigay roma ad oggi feudo indiscusso di fabrizio marrazzo noto ai lettori di questo blog per essere stato smentito con notevole clamore per certe sue sprovvedutezze mediatiche ricordate l inesistente aggressione fascista al roma pride 2008 ebbene il frinire delle fronde sembra provenire da un recentemente costituito comitato promotore a sostegno della candidatura di federica pezzoli che vorrebbe vedere contrapposta lavvocata romana gi responsabile dei temi transgender nella stessa associazione allimbarazzante boiardo fabrizio marrazzo

6640442 were constantly are trying to lower gas consumption and maintain the level of service we feel is expected
6640443 were developing another sub station to reduce the miles we go when we do investigation interviews or need to do a breathalyzer on someone
6640444 the sub stations save us a lot of miles driving
6640445 because of the size of the county its unrealistic to have cars driven back to a single point and then go back to where the car was patrolling
6640446 the law allows the defendant to do a video arraignment and they never choose to do that
6640447 they shouldnt have the right to choose it should be up to the court
6640448 were being creative where we can to try and save gas consumption its not like we are not going to try and comply to the resolution if passed gerace said
6640449 freilich w rde ich den wettkampf am liebsten nochmal wiederholen das war wohl unser bisher schlechtestes ergebnis doch ich habe immer davon getr umt einmal bei olympia zu starten jetzt bin ich ein olympionike also kann ich jetzt nicht entt uscht sein
6640450 unheimlich viele junge chinesinnen sind immer um mich herum ich wei gar nicht warum aber es gef llt mir
6640451 es halten so viele leute zu mir danke f r die unterst tzung
6640452 es ist und bleibt ein versuch man kann nicht voraussagen ob er das verkraftet
6640453 dont get me started on the mozzarella stick she said
6640454 wow a vampire could totally fall in love with her
6640455 der index ist unser ziel und wir sind optimistisch die kriterien daf r erf llen zu k nnen
6640456 the best organisation in the history of the olympic winter games
6640457 you know i never said that these were the best games and this is something i would never say i will have a qualification for these games which i believe will reflect the idea of the olympic family by the end of the games i ask them the athletes whats your impression of the games did you like it and i do the same with the leaders of the international sports federations i do the same with my colleagues of the ioc i speak to the sponsors and the broadcasters and then i discuss this together with my executive board and then we come to an agreement
6640458 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6640459 state and local parties have the primary responsibility for monitoring local voter registration and identifying problems our view is that advance monitoring of legal developments can avoid real legal problems later on especially on election day
6640460 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
6640461 he was a nice kid a friendly guy he didnt get into trouble
6640462 he was at home most of the time he always helped people out if he could
6640463 one of the youngsters who has worked very hard for their gcses has been the victim of this tragedy people are very shocked and upset
6640464 he climbed on to the outside of the tower block via an open balcony and then climbed down several floors trying to escape
6640465 he reached the seventh floor when he could no longer carry on after this point he fell to his death
6640466 the defendant exhaled and i had a strong odor of alcoholic beverages at that point
6640467 first i asked the defendant if shes been drinking and her reply was well yeah
6640468 i can say with relative certainty that this was a red light it was on at the time it was impacted
6640469 she never once asked about the other car never once asked about anybody else involved in the accident i asked where she was coming from never said anything about that
6640470 i thought it was odd that she was unusually calm considering what had just occurred
6640471 vote up if you know how many houses you own
6640472 i dont know how many homes i own this is stupid youre doing polls wrong
6640473 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
6640474 amazing feats of memory mental agility and apparent mental telepathy dazzling undeniably impressive
6640475 a smart fast paced mental magic show that is suitable for the entire family
6640476 sure david copperfield can walk through the great wall of china but can he read your mind sam eaton can
6640477 great fun for the entire family sam eaton is a consummate showman and a modern day houdini i couldnt get enough
6640478 two of the silliest pieces i have read on ya literature in ages
6640479 heres an idea why doesnt everyone just grow up and stop talking about this and let teens read what they want whether a publisher designates it ya or not
6640480 i really have a problem with this book it shouldnt be on the shortlist let alone win
6640481 college guys talk about what theyre reading what they read in high school and what books are important to them now
6640482 well weve established that the vanagon isnt exactly a race car
6640483 ruby dont drive your air cooled vanagon westfalia to town
6640484 id investigate whether a porsche or subaru boxer engine might fit
6640485 i mean how cool is it when your everyday transportation can double as an apartment
6640486 id love to see a prime minister who says lets all roll up our sleeves and work together
6640487 im not holding my breath but thats what id like to see
6640488 hes managed to get his entire program through with the help of the liberals and the bloc qu b cois so its actually not a valid complaint
6640489 its sort of like getting an mba on what the country is thinking or in this case the people of new hampshire
6640490 this is a great opportunity from a research perspective because its a major change that would normally take decades or centuries to see
6640491 a lot of people worked hard to do it and theyve done a wonderful job
6640492 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
6640493 he was a nice kid a friendly guy he didnt get into trouble he was at home most of the time he always helped people out if he could
6640494 maybe he was too nice he kept himself to himself he didnt get involved in trouble
6640495 when the network equipment detects a state approaching congestion it identifies the heaviest current users of the system based on their last few minutes of use no historic profiling and then deprioritizes their packets for periods of between 10 and 20 minutes
6640496 slow speed due to other people on the network is fine
6640497 no god cant be a presented as a woman yes there is a hierarchy in the holy trinity with god the father in command
6640498 i looked over and the five man on their kickoff team was star running back tim hightower
6640499 we kind of came to the conclusion that your best players need to be on those units
6640500 i think after the richmond game we were close to being one of the best special teams teams in the conference
6640501 its an honor to be named but ultimately its preseason
6640502 but im excited for the season last year i did well and a lot of it goes to the team that i was on we didnt have any blocked punts going into the last couple weeks of the season
6640503 he should be a starter on every special team for us
6640504 im just trying to get on the field as much as possible
6640505 i got on the field last year after i recovered from injury and im hoping to stay that way
6640506 we have a lot of experience but we still have to go out and do it
6640507 its kind of a pain to move all this stuff back so we thought lets leave it
6640508 well pack up one bag each whatever we can fit in the car
6640509 a potential buyer may be quite attracted to the idea of turn key move right in and instantly start enjoying this great home
6640510 we kept our place in seattle so you have to wonder how committed we were to being here
6640511 part of me feels that we didnt give it enough time
6640512 the conventional homebuyer programs have pretty much all done away with doing this this is something that has been specific to fha loans for quite some time
6640513 move up their time frame to buy a home a little quicker
6640514 is one of the things that is getting more people into the housing market when this is what we really need to get the economy going
6640515 it doesnt seem like the timing of the ban makes sense
6640516 and if you think you can prove me wrong do it
6640517 but let me tell you job youre wrong dead wrong
6640518 or you may fall on your knees and pray to gods delight
6640519 keep listening job dont not finished yet but if you think of anything i should know tell me theres nothing id like better than to see your name cleared meanwhile keep listening dont distract me with interruptions im going to teach you the basics of wisdom
6640520 wait aura you still have to give me a second chance
6640521 baileys marker propels stephenville squad into senior mens soccer final
6640522 it was great to play on a high quality pitch referring to the artificial turf in corner brook with all that we have to deal with on the west coast playing in dirt and rock in stephenville we cant get them to do nothing with our field
6640523 our fields are under a regular maintenance program and we are continuously working on them
6640524 the only thing that has changed in recent years is that we have more weeds because we have stopped spraying them with weed killers
6640525 cest le couronnement de deux ans dun norme travail cest d finitivement ma derni re course professionnelle
6640526 we have been deeply troubled by the lack of responsiveness by some federal and state appraiser regulators in carrying out the law
6640527 we hope this article proves to be a catalyst for modernizing the existing appraisal regulatory structure and making it more effective
6640528 you go out there and you want to prove people wrong and get better
6640529 hes a smart quarterback and we believe if hes out there that he can make the right reads and do what tom does out there
6640530 youve got to react and thats part of playing the position and its part of being a good offense
6640531 i would say everything he would probably be doing hes done before it is just a question of fine tuning it working on timing and all those kinds of things
6640532 some of the practices that he hasnt participated in are still things that he has done before not new things
6640533 but to the extent if there are new things and the player misses those then we will need to catch him up on it because the rest of the team has got it
6640534 any time you can get into game situations and get out there and be in game speed its great for the development process
6640535 the more you do it obviously the more comfortable you become
6640536 hes always very supportive and points out things that he thinks that i could get better on and also points out the things that i did really well
6640537 it doesnt matter to me what people say on the outside all that matters is whats going on internally and how im doing
6640538 i feel like im making a lot of progress and i feel like i know the offense and i feel like i can go out and execute the offense
6640539 what we want to do is devise a system to manage large items of solid waste well into the future
6640540 this is not an event its a process once we have this system up and running and in place theres no reason why it couldnt be used year after year indefinitely
6640541 hopefully at the meeting we will know the scope of the work and we will be able to get estimates from scrap metal companies on what theyll pay and what our groupings types of waste items should be
6640542 we think the pleasant state that can be induced by music leads to special physiological changes which eventually lead to stress reduction or direct immune enhancement
6640543 stress reduction probably plays an important role but the stress reducing effect seems to be different for various types of music
6640544 listening to music in hospitals might show benefits for patients and may for example lead to shorter recovery times
6640545 we are trying to get individuals to become more aware of their health
6640546 thats big not lazy not a glutton and certainly not deserving of the pompous poisonous disrespect served up daily to those of us with more bounce to the ounce
6640547 the state will feel good about itself for offering something and the person of size will end up paying 300 a year for the bad luck of having a chronic disease his her state sponsored insurance program failed to cover in an appropriate and meaningful fashion
6640548 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
6640549 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen
6640550 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
6640551 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
6640552 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
6640553 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
6640554 there has to be effective enforcement of some sort there has to be reality to it
6640555 what are you going to do if there is pressure on appraisers how are you going to penalize someone who puts that pressure on appraisers whos going to do it whos going to enforce it they need to have that or it wont work
6640556 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies
6640557 they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
6640558 gene was a leader mentor and friend to me and many others throughout his lifetime today is a sad day for all those who knew him as gene would have wanted the nfl players association will continue to move forward in making the nfl the greatest professional sports league in the country
6640559 my great great grandaddy made it possible for me to feel this wonderful warm air
6640560 although you may not get much money back in some cases its better than nothing especially in these tough economic times and we all know how quickly the value of electronics depreciates so those poor saps holding onto their first generation iphones should probably unload them asap

6640567 appleinsider reports that the mobileme web apps supposedly do use ssl even though you dont see https urls or the secure lock icon in your web browser
6640568 there are lots of ways for two parties keep rotating secrets on both sides of the wire without disclosing them see for example rfc 1938 i dont know exactly what apple is doing with json but dismissing it just because it isnt encrypted doesnt prove anything
6640569 verifying that software is genuine or that a website is what you expect
6640570 a supposedly sniff resistant ssl session that is still nonetheless 100 hosed
6640571 false sense of security that distracts from real security threats
6640572 mobileme web interface insecure but other apps get it right
6640573 being able to inject executable code into a system from malicious sources is a primary security problem for that reason web apps that transmit data using json have to authenticate with the server and regularly perform security handshakes to ensure that the data being sent back and forth is indeed coming from and going to a trusted source
6640574 unnecessary panic among web users who have equated their browsers ssl lock icon with web security
6640575 false sense of security that distracts from real security threats
6640576 we think ssl would bog down performance without providing security
6640577 while theres a reasonable if small risk someone might sniff your connection when you are out in public the odds of a redirection attack are extremely low
6640578 were cutting the growth in the budget and if its that hard to cut the growth in the budget you can see how we got to this point

6640588 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6640589 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6640590 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6640591 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6640592 there is incredible enthusiasm for barack obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
6640593 we can assure our supporters these texts did not come from the campaign and their data is secure everyone can also rest easy that despite their popularity mickey mouse and michael phelps are not on the short list at this time
6640594 we are proud to help cause confusion and excitement during this terrible boring week of no news at all
6640595 but we cant really take too much credit for it apparently one of our readers listens to which is still on the radio and heard of the veep txt hoax and figured out an easy way to do it through
6640596 so many of my so called friends have sent hoax texts to me now

6640599 yo yo o holy prophet i dont understand how it could be that the messiah is facing so much rejection from the infidels does the bible have anything to say about that i know from your teachings that the whole bible is about black liberation theology the evils of american chickens coming home to roost and that pap about doing stuff for the least of these but does it say anything about the messiahs rise to leadership
6640600 i dont think so grasshopper but lets actually look and see what it might have to say hmmm ive never seen this before it says that the messiah will be despised and rejected by men a man of sorrows and familiar with grief
6640601 well that certainly has become true so i must be on the right track
6640602 it says here that the messiahs father has forsaken him
6640603 yeah yeah thats happened to me i surely am the one
6640604 here it talks about the messiah being betrayed by someone close to him
6640605 here some soldiers put a crown of thorns on his head spit on him and slug him until he is barely recognizable
6640606 well the messiah does rise from the grave ascends into heaven and promises to come back
6640607 well actually the world has been waiting over 2 000 years for that to be fulfilled except i think he visited the jehovahs witnesses
6640608 ya mean i wont become president til at least the year 4008
6640609 it appears so obamessiah and youll be hanging out with the jws til then
6640610 i dont know about that but im sure glad im off your bus

6640657 but we were in touch with their parents before they left the scene
6640658 a lot of work the defense is ahead the offense needs work more so than other years at this point right now weve got to get better on offense
6640659 we lose the center nick couturier whos been leading the offensive line the last few years the quarterback and keith levan a three year starter at the slot receiver position all three were pretty key parts of our offense
6640660 we didnt have the physicalness coming off the ball that we need
6640661 the doctors saw him and hes on some anti inflammatories
6640662 if this was a game he would have played today
6640663 but we picked it up toward the end of the scrimmage i think we came out a little flat more than anything else
6640664 i thought overall we ran to the ball pretty good and i thought we were closing on the ball better than we were last year at this time
6640665 hell be ok when he figures out whats going on
6640666 hes a big strong kid whos got a little vision hes got to figure it out though

6640670 it makes me mad i had to pay in the first place
6640671 once you agree to it then its a done deal and its a contract
6640672 to me it does not make sense to charge our veterans an extra fee when all they want to do is display the pride they have in their service
6640673 our veterans have sacrificed for us and if they choose to show the pride they have in their service we should not be charging them extra to do so
6640674 were never exactly sure how long she will be in the hospital

6640696 i think that the school board has been very good about trying to have competitive salaries for the administrative team
6640697 the town council is supportive of paying employees and department heads a wage thats comparable to the competition
6640698 they support the experience each individual brings to the community
6640699 talk talk talk all you ever do is talk all talk and no action words are cheap what value is there in talking
6640700 there will only be one or two additional light rail lines in this region
6640701 we just simply dont have the population density and we wont get the federal matching dollars
6640702 and express buses but the dynamics simply dont exist for a huge expansion of light rail we might only have one or two more commuter rail lines in this region
6640703 we at met council support that broader definition of transitways
6640704 weve studied 29 corridors many of which are not eligible for commuter rail or bus rapid transit there just isnt the ridership maybe the only thing that makes sense for them is an express bus route we think that should be allowed under the quarter cent sales tax funding
6640705 we havent decided whether to pursue that but i have weighed in on it in part because id like you guys to come in as payers into the system and i know you wont if you dont get anything back and i dont blame you
6640706 even though it wasnt the ending i wanted i wouldnt trade the last four years
6640707 youve got to make up your mind before you dive to enjoy it youre going to walk away with certain memories if you make it good
6640708 it would be like if you pulled your hamstring and had to run a 100 yard dash how good are you going to be
6640709 when you dont have that capability of holding up out there your confidence goes out the door youre more worried about injury at that point
6640710 she didnt hold one entry tonight she couldnt actually im really quite happy we didnt dislocate a shoulder shes up in age and shes been up there for a long long long time
6640711 she left it all in the pool like she always does and shell come out of here with her head held high
6640712 i wouldnt change a minute we can go back and do it all over again if she likes it would be fine
6640713 he was only gone an hour one block away from home how could something like that happen
6640714 were confident that there are more people who know what happened and who have the rest of the pieces of the puzzle
6640715 im going to do it because somebodys going to want that money
6640716 its a big resource its got a good cost curve and its not getting enough attention
6640717 i feel that the current leadership in the guam fire department is adversely affecting the morale and welfare of its personnel
6640718 they open their minds to the many things that the world has to offer
6640719 i really want to teach i want my students to know what their skills are in kindergarten and i want to prepare them for the first grade for the next level as much as i can
6640720 why would the legislature give the right to an individual voter if were saying these are the rights of the parties
6640721 dalam forum yang terhormat ini secara khusus saya menyampaikan penghargaan yang setinggi tingginya kepada para gubernur bupati walikota camat termasuk lurah dan kepala desa serta pimpinan anggota dprd yang telah bekerja keras mencurahkan pikiran waktu dan tenaganya untuk meningkatkan kesejahteraan rakyat
6640722 sebagai kepala negara dan kepala pemerintahan saya menyampaikan ucapan terima kasih yang tulus dan penghargaan yang setinggi tingginya
6640723 betapa bahagianya saya ketika berkunjung ke daerah dan melihat berbagai program pembangunan yang berjalan dengan baik apalagi jika di situ dibangun dengan dana apbd

6640727 my foot has been bothering me for about a year
6640728 about 70 or 80 meters into the race i felt something tear
6640729 i went under the stadium and had a doctor look at it he gave me some injections that did really well but in the long jump it started to hurt again
6640730 i told my coach there is no way i can take a second shot
6640731 i realized id have to get an injection after every event and it just wasnt worth it
6640732 it was deja vu it definitely brought the memories right back
6640733 ever since 04 i have never been quite healthy this has been bothering since last year at least now that it has ruptured maybe it will start to heal
6640734 i wont make any decisions until i see how my foot goes well see
6640735 in the first half we werent knocking down shots but we were playing great defense and that was what allowed us to stay in the game
6640736 coach said that defense was the difference between today and two years ago
6640737 two years ago we had the same thing where we couldnt score but then we couldnt keep them from scoring but this year we found a way to play as a unit and get those stops
6640738 we always talk about offensively we are going to find a way to score enough points to win
6640739 look at the firepower we have for us our goal is to hold the other team under 60 points this russia is a team coming in so prolific on the offensive end coach said going in that she thought our defense was going to win the game for us and it came true
6640740 catchings is just a firecracker when she gets in the game
6640741 she changes the game with her energy she swung it our way tonight
6640742 this was a big game because it was a semifinal game in the olympics not necessarily because of me and the whole united states thing
6640743 ive been to togo only once when i was very young
6640744 i was on the bubble but if i didnt make it id know i tried my best and id cheer for my country
6640745 she said something to me at one point but i just kept right on going
6640746 well this is nice but you could add this and cartoon this
6640747 have to drive intranets from business needs and in line with business outcomes
6640748 the corporate directory is the number one application for the intranet
6640749 there has been a much higher interest in governance this year
6640750 then i went to grab it and there was nothing its kind of the way its been happening to me this olympics
6640751 but i know its my job to get the guy the baton and i didnt do that
6640752 if you garnish my salary i will find out who your married boyfriend is and i will tell his wife
6640753 sensitive data on prisoners has been mislaid and jacqui smith hasnt a clue where it is
6640754 the british taxpayer will be absolutely outraged if they are made to pick up the bill for compensation to serious criminals
6640755 it is vital sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
6640756 searching questions must be answered about what safeguards were in place to protect this information
6640757 first time buyers are the people who have been hit hard
6640758 we would say whatever the government can do do it for first time buyers if the government can find a way to underwrite the securitised loans that banks are having difficulty refinancing then that could ease the situation
6640759 trading conditions have been the most challenging in persimmons recent history our results for the period reflect this difficult market
6640760 there has been a major step down in activity since the end of march
6640761 he catches everything thrown in his direction he has been opening peoples eyes since he got here
6640762 its nice to be mentioned with some of the great receivers in penn state history but im really not worried about the records
6640763 no more games no more well theres next year possibly this is it you want everything done right so you find yourself being a little tougher on the younger guys because they have another year and they dont realize the seriousness of the moment
6640764 you can kind of sense that urgency that the seniors before you had why they wanted you to be perfect in workouts and why they wanted you to take practice seriously because this is the last go round
6640765 for a lot of us guys this could be our last time playing organized football you just want it to be serious
6640766 we know stuff without having to communicate to each other we can do things on the fly
6640767 their size brings a whole different element to this offense
6640768 maybe theyre not as open as they could be but you can throw a jump ball to those guys and theyll go up and get it the red zone is going to be a big difference with those guys they complement us well
6640769 a lot of guys are going to be able to step up graham zugs doing real good derek moye is really coming into his own this year he finally knows what hes doing so now he doesnt have to really think about what route to run
6640770 we just keep letting our younger guys know not to push for stardom if you push for the team and we win the publicity will come more people will want to find out about you when youre winning

6640772 there are ups and downs when they go through that process
6640773 today is a good day some days its not as good as others
6640774 i dont know how much pain is in there how much better its feeling i think erik is the only one who can answer it and unfortunately hes not talking
6640775 i kind of hope we limit it to that but i think its a good idea
6640776 the home run thats the furthest thing away from the umpires
6640777 everything else is close to them but when it happens out there and its bouncing around off of rails and poles i dont think theres anything wrong with getting technical help there
6640778 i told somebody one time if they started a league called the backyard league where you threw a football into the backyard and you let guys choose up teams and make their own rules and play football the first two guys i would choose on my team are steve tasker and doug flutie
6640779 they know how to play the game probably because they are small they have been forced to figure out ways to be good they dont need somebody to tell them what to do they would figure it out they would be inventive creative and be two of the best players in that league and i think justin is a little like that all his life he has been forced to overachieve and make things work because he is not as tall as everyone else
6640780 if you stand up on him i dont care how big you are he is going to knock you down hit them in the mouth that is his philosophy that is something i picked up from him early on letting them know that just because you are small or short doesnt mean you can just run over me
6640781 there are little guys out there who are 5 8 165 or 170 pounds those guy generally dont last too long
6640782 they might light it up for a while but they cant take the physical beating and then there are these guys who are 5 6 5 7 and weigh 200 pounds they are not little guys they are just short guys its a big difference justin just like jones drew is a short guy
6640783 the thing about those men they are so quick and yet they are explosive they do a great job pressing the line of scrimmage and then they make some great cuts
6640784 the things that he did against chicago were the things that i have seen from him back in college
6640785 it wasnt like there was a big lane that opened and he ran through it he made people miss tackles he can break tackles you see guys fall off him he spins out of some things he does a lot of good things
6640786 im sorry you didnt choose to sit on your chair and have a cookie this week maybe next week you can make a different choice
6640787 we want to push the genre farther forward were bringing innovation this year
6640788 they can pick up the standalone version of world tour and use those instruments and when they break they can buy ours
6640789 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
6640790 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused
6640791 there are holes in this story that you can drive a truck through
6640792 we conducted the study without bias without interference from anyone
6640793 we have only one single minded goal in this effort
6640794 dr steven jones found it in the dust that landed in the entire area of lower manhattan and he finds it in the chunks of previously molten metal from the towers
6640795 if water had been available it is likely that sprinklers would have operated and the building may still be here today
6640796 it looks like they want to wrap up this investigation and blame the collapse on normal office fires
6640797 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6640798 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6640799 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6640800 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6640801 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6640802 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6640803 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6640804 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6640805 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

6640809 ive figured out what it takes to be really good friends with someone you have to have a very similar personality you have to be together a lot and when you first meet you have to be willing to not be nervous to meet that person or else you might miss a wonderful friendship if you never thought to introduce yourself so it basically takes a lot to become a good friend the hardest part is not being nervous when you first meet and being willing to become friends
6640810 you might not want to try to touch someones glass eye to see what it feels like because you might accidentally touch the wrong one
6640811 i saw the officer running from it i looked to the left and there was a guy standing in the yard and i looked at the officer he was down
6640812 i said im trying to get to you and they were still shooting at him
6640813 he was shot in the lower abdomen thats the first wound i saw then i saw the upper shot
6640814 i was leaning down trying to hold his head up
6640815 i knew if i could keep his head up and keep him talking he would make it the first thing that came to my mind was to keep him talking
6640816 i could have easily turned around and avoided it i could have went the other way i couldve but something made me stop
6640817 i couldnt leave a guy laying over there in the gutter that would really bother me
6640818 i dont think anyone in those houses saw the officer on the ground it was a dark area i dont think he would have made it
6640819 i wanted to make sure he was ok and i wanted to secure him so they wouldnt come over and kill him
6640820 he was someones child or father you know he just wasnt a police officer he could have been anyone i just wanted to help him because he needed help and he was doing his job
6640821 i think i was meant to be there i was right there when it happened and im glad i was there
6640822 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

6640824 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6640825 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6640826 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6640827 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6640828 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6640829 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6640830 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6640831 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6640832 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6640833 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6640834 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6640835 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6640836 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6640837 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6640838 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6640839 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6640840 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6640841 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6640842 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6640843 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6640844 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6640845 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6640846 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6640847 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6640848 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6640849 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6640850 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6640851 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6640852 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6640853 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6640854 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6640855 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6640856 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6640857 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6640858 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6640859 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6640860 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6640861 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6640862 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6640863 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6640864 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6640865 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6640866 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6640867 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6640868 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6640869 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6640870 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6640871 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6640872 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6640873 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6640874 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6640875 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6640876 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6640877 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6640878 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
6640879 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
6640880 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
6640881 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country

6640886 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

6640888 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6640889 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6640890 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6640891 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6640892 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6640893 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6640894 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6640895 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6640896 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6640897 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6640898 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6640899 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6640900 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6640901 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6640902 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6640903 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6640904 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6640905 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6640906 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6640907 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6640908 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6640909 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future

6640917 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
6640918 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
6640919 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
6640920 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
6640921 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
6640922 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
6640923 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do

6640927 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6640928 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6640929 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6640930 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6640931 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

6640933 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

6640941 peet limited expects to be operating within a challenging australian residential market in the year ahead with clear signs that the difficult macroeconomic environment will persist in fy09
6640942 nonetheless the fundamentals of the residential property market remain sound
6640943 while short term issues such as affordability purchaser confidence and investor activity can cause more volatile short term cycles long term prospects for residential property development are strongly linked to underlying supply and demand
6640944 the current cycle has resulted in a major shortfall in housing supply relative to underlying demand which is determined by factors such as population growth driven by international migration and employment rates and those factors remain positive
6640945 interest rates are also a key catalyst for consumer sentiment and while anticipated lower interest rates are unlikely to spark an immediate response it should have a positive impact on the residential property market

6640962 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6640963 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6640964 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6640965 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6640966 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6640967 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6640968 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6640969 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6640970 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6640971 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6640972 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6640973 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6640974 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6640975 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6640976 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6640977 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6640978 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6640979 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6640980 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6640981 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

6640986 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6640987 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6640988 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6640989 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6640990 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6640991 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6640992 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6640993 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6640994 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6640995 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6640996 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6640997 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6640998 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6640999 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6641000 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6641001 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6641002 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6641003 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6641004 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6641005 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6641006 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6641007 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6641008 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6641009 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6641010 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6641011 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6641012 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6641013 because while robert certainly was a tremendously gifted storyteller with a wholly original voice capable of spinning an exciting yarn in first draft that could capture his readers imagination he simply wasnt a great writer
6641014 the assumption being of course that reh didnt need editing not by wright de camp or anyone else a questionable assertion
6641015 farnsworth wright was a good editor for robert e howard his suggestions and edits improved roberts work and helped him to mature as a writer
6641016 i think it would be better if you had this guy here do this
6641017 but the phoenix of sic the sword has points of real excellence i hope you will see your way clear to touch it up and resubmit it it is the first two chapters that do not click the story opens rather uninterestingly it seems to me and the reader has difficulty in orienting himself

6641019 people should not allow their credit cards to be taken away from their sight
6641020 they should watch as cashiers swipe their credit cards and immediately retake possession of them on the purchase is made
6641021 we believe this began in this area but initially were afraid it may have spread outside of the area
6641022 we began asking the victims to trace their purchases and determined the only common factor was they all bought items at the local mcdonalds he said

6641026 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6641027 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6641028 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6641029 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6641030 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6641031 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6641032 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6641033 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6641034 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6641035 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6641036 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6641037 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6641038 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6641039 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6641040 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6641041 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6641042 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6641043 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6641044 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6641045 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6641046 changes in technology alter the symbolic environment the socially constructed sensory world of meaning that in turn shapes our perception experiences attitudes and behaviors

6641048 why is it that there are so many books on leadership yet not everyone who aspires to become a leader is a leader
6641049 why is it that there are so many damn traits and theories about leadership who is going to memorize all this

6641053 this will be the first time photographs of the exhibition in venice have been shown we named this show he puna manawa puna as a translation of pool or spring where all of the video production took place and manawa or heart after te manawa regional museum and the manawatu river that is at the heart of the local community
6641054 it was about two years ago that we did the filming in the creeks around the university and at the dive hq training pool
6641055 participating in the venice biennale was a really big undertaking we had a short lead in time and there wasnt enough funding available to cover our costs we decided to pull out all the stops as only a handful of new zealand artists have ever exhibited there
6641056 four days before we left by my sister hana who is a ceramic artist decided to come with us for five weeks she was our gofer and cook
6641057 the people of venice related to the exhibition and the notion of a town drowning it connected with them
6641058 at these things you usually have wine nibbles and occasionally speeches but not often while we didnt have kaum tua with us we did follow tikanga in the opening ceremony with karanga karakia and whaik rero the whole ceremony was conducted in m ori and italian and the experience of that really struck them

6641096 recycling plastic bags is certainly as convenient as using a reusable cloth bag and we think its something consumers can adapt to
6641097 once that playground slide breaks its not getting recycled again
6641098 were going to get it passed because its a no brainer in fairfax
6641099 a lot of towns want to do this but they dont want to get sued if the voters pass it its a precedent for the public to say no to plastic bags

6641109 he told me he didnt think they could do anything with james it wasnt going to get done
6641110 james told me to keep negotiating now and during the season
6641111 james has played at an extremely high level for the entire time ive been here
6641112 it was a pleasure getting that deal done its great to know hes going to be part of our future
6641113 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective

6641122 it was a bit of a shock to see the levels and the widespread presence of these pesticides
6641123 we already had in place ways to test for viruses bacteria and fungi but it was difficult to find an analytical laboratory that could analyze for unknown pesticides
6641124 we need to look at all pesticides not just those used in beekeeping
6641125 we are finding fungicides that function by inhibiting the steroid metabolism in the fungal disease they target but these chemicals also affect similar enzymes in other organisms
6641126 these fungicides in combination with pyrethroids and or neonictotinoids can sometimes have a synergistic effect hundreds of time more toxic than any of the pesticides individually
6641127 this synergistic effect has only been demonstrated to occur under highly artificial laboratory conditions in field trials there was no evidence of synergistic toxicity to honey bees
6641128 oh hey you again buying two fountain drinks thats a surprise

6641140 it is shocking that the union would act like this
6641141 it is no different to any other workplace there are requirements when an employee wants to undertake activities outside their employment that have the potential to bear upon their employment and they are required to get the approval of the employer to do that

6641147 the steelers have been good to me and i put all my heart and soul into this and im going to try to close it out
6641148 its not something im dwelling on its on them if they want to make that decision or not well take it when that time comes
6641149 its all in the organization what they want to do
6641150 james is a great player theyre smart to do something like that
6641151 james has played at an extremely high level for the entire time that ive been here its a pleasure to get that deal done were glad to get it done glad that hes going to be here in the future not only is he an outstanding player but hes an outstanding professional and outstanding leader
6641152 when you look at the number of older linebackers out there you can go to ray lewis junior seau willie mcginest tedy bruschi london fletcher it seems like james is getting stronger
6641153 when you have a leader like that to keep the guy around and the type of player he is you cant do nothing but help the team
6641154 its a matter of how you perform and thats what this business is based on how you perform hes been doing it for a long time and i think hell continue doing it for a long time
6641155 kevin i love you and i am sorry for being such a bad wife b c i left you at the worse possible time ever

6641157 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
6641158 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
6641159 if people get down there on the floor and want to start blowing kazoos and making a scene we want to make sure weve got people who stand in front of them with obama signs
6641160 is it typical for a losing candidate to have their own whip team no but its also not usual for a losing candidate to get 18 million votes either
6641161 we have been and are working closely with the obama campaign to make sure we have an exciting and unified convention
6641162 our delegate whips along with the obama delegate whips are a part of a team that will be on the floor of the convention to make sure delegates have everything they need whether thats answering questions or passing out signs during hillarys speech the whips are a traditional part of every conventions floor operations
6641163 a funny sexy and poignant look at the journey of three all american girls as they mature from cheerleaders to sorority sisters to independent women spanning the turbulent 60s through the late 80s vanities celebrates the lives and loves of three best friends caught up in rapidly changing times
6641164 a whole new scene no longer just a coda or epilogue set years after the ending of the original play
6641165 the 60s and early 70s were arguably the richest era for pop music in the whole 20th century from the beatles to burt bacharach to even broadway which as we know was enjoying sort of its last gasp at the top of the hit parade with everything from hair to hello dolly since vanities the play takes place over that entire period i heard the music in the piece right away and since the story revolves around a friendship between three women thats what i zeroed in on for inspiration the girl group music of the supremes and shirelles the songs of lesley gore and ellie greenwich moving through the decade into the more soulful sounds of legends like janis joplin and tina turner and the singer songwriters like joni mitchell carly simon and carole king interestingly enough those last three just had a best selling book published about their music and the complicated relationship between them called girls like us one thing thats different about the musical is that it goes beyond the timeframe of the original play and adds a new scene set 15 years later that takes us to about 1990 by which time pop music obviously had a whole different kind of sound so we have some fun with that for one song
6641166 but hopefully the whole thing is filtered through a theatrical sensibility and my own style and sounds cohesive as a score i love jacks original play and these three characters and ive been having the time of life musicalizing all of it with him

6641172 on some levels hamlet 2 is a parody of inspirational teacher movies goodbye mr chips and dead poets society and dangerous minds dana is pretty idiotic at times but he does what he says hes going to do ultimately inspire his students
6641173 theres no upside to being adversarial in these kind of deals youve just got to stay positive and youve got to focus on whos here and have trust and faith in the people that are working on getting everything done
6641174 its nothing major it just hurts a little when i try to make catches and stuff
6641175 he and i became really good friends we were there in the tough times in the good times too
6641176 he is really going to be missed in the nfl and by football generally
6641177 obviously life moves on but i dont know that anybody can replace gene upshaw
6641178 the games the most important thing and thats what youre trying to protect
6641179 he saw that and i saw that with him we just started that and as you do with friendship youre with people for a time when i had my 50th wedding anniversary he and his wife terry came we had that kind of relationship
6641180 he came to my fathers and my mothers funerals we were pretty close
6641181 i played against him when i was with the houston oilers and he was with the raiders he was a great player his leadership will be missed by all in the nfl
6641182 i think overall for the players you can throw darts at gene all over the board but he did far more than anybody who ever started in this business free agency and where the system is is far better than any player ever imagined
6641183 how could these a propos songs from the 80s really be the ones he woke up to unless hes just making this up

6641194 they were getting guys on base and making me work
6641195 it was a grind i had to work a lot
6641196 its imperative we throw our support behind alex as opposed to throwing him under the bus as i inexplicably did last season by the way we handled his shoulder injury 22 july 2008
6641197 if a guy has a first time offense i dont believe in throwing that guy under the bus to try to stave off the wolves so to speak
6641198 the reason todd jones is not the closer right now is because the quality of his pitches and the location of his pitches was not good enough
6641199 if you think im going to throw my white sox under the bus because im here in minnesota thats not going to happen
6641200 hes never been afraid to throw nominees under the bus
6641201 in his own election in 06 you know he abandoned every republican on the ticket so the fact that hes wishy washy in his comments now is nothing new for him

6641212 i went out to the mound many times to check pitchers injuries but never for a cracked molar we needed a dentist
6641213 that was a little cubbie occurrence that was a first for me first for the umpire
6641214 we had zambrano sort of on the ropes early he wasnt that sharp and he got out of the first with no runs he had a runner on third with less than two outs that was really the difference in the ball game
6641215 we held their offense down pretty good too we played a good series we just came up a run short of winning the series

6641224 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event
6641225 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down
6641226 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of wtc 7
6641227 we did not find any evidence that explosives were used to bring the building down
6641228 this size blast would have produced an incredibly loud sound that was not recorded on videos of the collapse nor reported by witnesses
6641229 collapse was also not due to fires from the substantial amount of diesel fuel stored in the building
6641230 the idea is by tomorrow night all those forces will move to within that perimeter the peacekeeping perimeter

6641236 first his troops are going to be out on monday then his troops were gonna be out on wednesday now his troops are gonna be out on friday
6641237 im beginning to wonder if the russian president is ever going to keep his word or can he keep his word or whats going on there
6641238 many people have died because of russias use of cluster munitions in georgia even as moscow denied it had used this barbaric weapon

6641290 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6641291 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6641292 but if youre like me and you got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home then you might have a different perspective
6641293 and by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6641294 when it comes to founders we know we are usually going to see something odd
6641295 in some cases they are exorbitantly paid and in others they are paid miserly
6641296 some of this might be overreacting to the recent dramatic increase in gasoline prices
6641297 consumers are still going to buy the biggest suv or car they can afford with the best mileage they can get
6641298 we certainly are seeing more interest in full size suvs and trucks over the last several weeks
6641299 remember we are in our eighth week of declining fuel prices in the u s
6641300 in may we were selling one truck for every one car we sold at our dealers and we had never been one to one it was always three trucks to two cars
6641301 however in june when ford came out with employee pricing things changed my theory is when something is cheap enough people buy it we began to see the trend for sales go back more toward trucks
6641302 july was really something we had our best truck month in the pittsburgh region since august 2007 that really blew our minds so the incentives combined with the reduction in gas prices greatly increased our truck sales
6641303 last month when you saw gas prices going down a little we noticed that the price and value reductions for big cars and trucks slowed down also the increases in the residual value of small cars leveled off too they are still increasing but at a reduced rate
6641304 our experience has been that american consumers adapt pretty rapidly to fuel price spikes and higher fuel prices i think people were initially shocked and there were some people who reacted in knee jerk fashion and said hey i gotta get out of my suv or hey i dont want to spend 100 for a tank of gas now people are starting to have a more rational take on all of this
6641305 residual values a new vehicles projected value after 36 months for trucks and full sized suvs declined at about twice the rate at which they normally declined over the last few months that was very steep
6641306 now things are starting to level out again some suvs like chevy tahoe ford expedition and toyota land cruiser had dropped by as much as 25 or 30 percent over a six month period of time those residual values have now stabilized
6641307 irrevocable trusts often cannot be fdic insured for more than 100 000
6641308 the broker would be responsible with providing the fdic with documentation
6641309 we dont know exactly what we are going to do with it
6641310 this is a non traditional approach that blends our most valuable artist and their music with the power of brand marketing
6641311 im sick of it im sick of the whole industry
6641312 im frustrated broken hearted i cant make money at it anymore
6641313 why are there three record shops in this city when there once was 167
6641314 i loved this business but 15 years ago the industry started dropping out from the independents and going with the mass merchandisers best buy circuit city and wal mart and those three places sell cds below cost my cost from a distributor is 12 97 theyre retailing them at 10 99
6641315 the city could have helped by supporting this collection as a museum
6641316 the heinz history center said theyd take the records by the local pittsburgh artists but i wouldnt split that out of my collection
6641317 now on a saturday if i do 200 today its a miracle
6641318 pittsburgh is such a famous city for music do you think anybody knows that
6641319 they dont even know the artists i go to their funerals and theres nobody there some of the people who wrote some of the grandest music that exists and they dont even know who the hell they are
6641320 im looking for something new and exciting to do i want to do something dark or a comedy
6641321 theres tons of icons that i would love to work with on something new and exciting
6641322 unfortunately that end of the house was already well alight
6641323 the flames were so intense they burnt trees around the property the entire home was fully involved very quickly and totally destroyed
6641324 we have a couple of theories as to how the blaze started but we wont speculate at this stage
6641325 d s que vous commencez examiner les questions dadoption en cor e vous serez imm diatement confront s dautres probl mes beaucoup plus gros qui doivent tre r solus

6641335 its had a couple of rallies up toward these levels and its just failed mr vrondas said
6641336 i think todays move is just a little bit of profit taking really
6641337 if we see some demand for euro against the us dollar when europe steps in then that will probably help the aussie mr vrondas said
6641338 it appears as though the market is still relatively buoyed at the moment on the back of the performance in commodities
6641339 we might see a bit more of a pullback in the us dollar
6641340 words cannot adequately describe the impact of your conduct on the lives of innocent people
6641341 ours is behaving in a similar way were actually looking okay he said
6641342 its been led mainly by the resources the banks were lagging and now the banks have picked up
6641343 its terrible if you walked around in a t shirt with that written on it in english you would be arrested
6641344 they should be fined and get the van off the road it doesnt do much for cairns as a tourism destination to have vans driving around with something vulgar like that on it
6641345 finally to take leave while constituting means to construct through the reterritorialization that the bodies of the multitude experience in postmodernity common machines through which men and women stretch out beyond the edge of time

6641357 it was a flight from singapore to siem reap it was a very rainy day
6641358 when staff did a go around of the aircraft after landing they discovered that one of the left hand tyres wasnt fully deflated but it obviously had some cuts on it and there was mud on the aircraft
6641359 there was not permanent damage to the aircraft and no injury to passengers
6641360 because there was only damage to the left hand wheels it would be incorrect to say that the aircraft totally left the runway there was nothing wrong with the right hand wheels
6641361 left the runway and blew a tyre and scraped the ground
6641362 weve been told that technical difficulties in siem reap have caused the cancellation for a full 24 hours
6641363 hay un segmento de personas que quedan desprotegidas como el caso de los menores de 18 a os en sectores donde est habilitado el acto de fumar
6641364 dejar el asunto al albur de acuerdos entre fumadores y no fumadores o sencillamente en los padres o tutores del ni o o ni a resulta una barrera para la adopci n de medidas realmente protectoras y eficaces si tenemos en cuenta que un 2 8 de los casos de c ncer de pulm n se relacionan con el tabaquismo pasivo

6641384 so like a fucking moron i started to show them the video for the song which is basically fitty pulling up to a mansion in a lamborghini and then opening the front door revealing scads of fancy ladies in sundry states of undressitude puckering their dewy lips and gyrating their sundry dewy protuberances in his general direction
6641385 you gon back that thing up or should i push up on it
6641386 when you start invading smaller neighbours bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and carrying out the wanton destruction of its infrastructure that is isolating
6641387 nearly one third of the survey participants reported having experienced some form of discrimination in the workplace with approximately the same amount 31 reporting that they believed they had not been hired for a job specifically because they were transgender a full 15 reported that they had been fired from a job for being transgender with 40 of those people having been fired more than once nearly 10 reported experiencing open blatant discrimination from an employer or prospective employer they were explicitly told that they were being fired or not hired because they were transgender
6641388 you dont have anyone breathing down your neck to do your work or even go to class thats a good thing and a bad thing
6641389 no one likes to be nagged but sometimes you need it to get motivated
6641390 my best friend just moved to cincinnati from orlando and now im moving up to school so i feel like she thinks i am abandoning her
6641391 my biggest fear coming into my freshman year was not knowing if the professors were good at letting us out on time and knowing i had a class in five minutes across campus
6641392 and appears unlikely to select anyone who supports abortion rights
6641393 were just floating petraeus to use you and grab attention
6641394 it became apparent to me as a capitalist that if i lent myself to this sort of action by his fellow businessmen and resisted any change designed to benefit all the people i could be consumed by the poisons of social lag i had helped to create
6641395 we have examined everything down to the smallest of details we have worked with anz stadium and nsw police we have spoken with manly we have spoken with our members and unfortunately we have been unable to clearly identify the perpetrator
6641396 we have done everything we can and unless someone steps forward and owns up to this or we receive further information to help with the inquiry then we consider the investigation to be closed
6641397 somebody out there knows who this cowardly person is and its only a matter of time before we know who it is as well
6641398 this is a serious incident which goes against everything our club stands for and it is poor form that a member or fan would do something like this in the first instance and secondly tar the name of the club and its members by not owning up to their mistake
6641399 one study at lee university found that first semester grades of teenage students who had always attended public tax supported schools were slightly lower than the grades of students who had received some home schooling instruction by parents at home although the grade differences disappeared in the second semester these results suggest that home schooling is the best way to educate teenage children therefore instead of spending more money on public education the government should provide financial incentives so that home schooling is an option for more parents after all children schooled at home receive more attention since they are taught by the best possible teacher a parent who has a high stake in educating them well
6641400 nothing profits more than self esteem grounded on what is just and right
6641401 patient confidentiality laws prevent me from discussing these or any other patients who may have been admitted to the facility
6641402 aurora las encinas has been committed to quality patient care and service to the community for over 100 years and will continue to do so we are not at liberty to comment on recent media coverage due to patient confidentiality
6641403 not a very good track record especially at an expensive hospital like that
6641404 up until a few months ago people remained quite bullish about their own circumstances despite being pessimistic about the economy as a whole
6641405 these latest figures indicate that people are starting to think that some of the economic trends may begin to start affecting them directly
6641406 i kept the television off and didnt discuss war with the kids around if they had questions or worries i reminded them that he was going to be as safe as possible and that it was our job to pray for all the soldiers not just daddy i set up individual email accounts for each child as they got older but dad was the only one who e mailed them they loved that they always got to talk to him individually whenever he called and as long as it wasnt a school night id wake them even if he called late it was worth the loss of a few minutes of sleep
6641407 consider having daddy say goodbye to the kids at home and then you and only you go with him to the airport its very tough on kids when they see mommy and daddy crying
6641408 in the previous ad we stated that john mccain own 7 houses we were wrong john mccain owns at a minimum 10 houses
6641409 the first few weeks of the academic year typically are quiet but by october all of the slots are full with a waiting list the majority of clients are referred by nearby high schools but some have come from as far as illinois it is not unusual for students in the program to pile up 50 absences a year one teen had not set foot in a classroom for two years
6641410 kids are miserable and parents are frustrated no matter what parents say or do it doesnt make any difference and they dont know where to turn
6641411 hey jeppesen shame shame theres blood on your hands and blood on your name
6641412 after general tagubas investigation of the dehumanizing treatment of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq there is no doubt that the bush administration has committed war crimes and we will all be held accountable for our actions torture is not what this nation is about
6641413 no state party shall expel return or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to torture
6641414 but ive still got to look forward i look forward to the us open try to save my season
6641415 when someone sets the bar so high guys find a way of creeping up behind you
6641416 i find attractive the arguments of scholars such as stephen macedo who defend an activist supreme court that would
6641417 that caught me off guard and i had no recollection of making so atypical a statement which shook me up even more
6641418 now it would seem to me what you were talking about
6641419 is you find attractive the fact that they are activists and they would like to strike down existing laws that impact on restricting the use of property rights because you know that is what they write about
6641420 it has been quite some time since i have read professor macedo but i dont believe that in my writings i have indicated that we should have an activist supreme court or that we should have any form of activism on the supreme court
6641421 but the libertarian argument overlooks the place of the supreme court in a scheme of separation of powers one does not strengthen self government and the rule of law by having the non democratic branch of the government make policy
6641422 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness
6641423 i like the fact that for the most part my poems are pretty accessible
6641424 they can have homework in every subject almost every night not just in math and english
6641425 thats a big change from sixth grade not only managing the expectations of different teachers but managing a binder and going from class to class is also a challenge
6641426 we want them to learn to bring the right books to class and get to class on time
6641427 a daily planner is a great communication tool between home and school
6641428 we also encourage study hours like from 7 to 9 or 6 to 8 just to have two hours without any distractions
6641429 another thing that really helps with the transition is to get involved cross country the drama club or mock trial
6641430 there are all sorts of things going on throughout the year getting involved is highly encouraged and once they do theyre so psyched
6641431 the dances are a big thing here there are about six a year
6641432 i encourage parents to get kids on a school schedule about two weeks before going to bed early waking up a little earlier
6641433 we take blank calendars and break down the work for them that really helps they cant wrap their head around a six page paper but they wait until the last week to do it
6641434 they see me as younger and its easier for them to talk to me about things
6641435 i always say what happens in my office stays in my office
6641436 tell him he cant use a cell phone video game etc
6641437 take it away from him its such a problem for parents i would just be like no not now thats something a lot of parents struggle with
6641438 its hard to know how a kids doing unless they come to me or a teacher gives me a heads up she said
6641439 its easier to talk to them now than when theyre 14 and 15 theyre still kids
6641440 would give them a stronger base if they had an extra year
6641441 once they master it a sense of relief comes over them
6641442 everyone in this building is trained to work with adolescents and understands the changes theyre going through
6641443 overall the majority of the kids do fine transition fine

6641460 the appellate judicial commission has selected three candidates who they believe should serve on the missouri supreme court and i will thoughtfully review their selections
6641461 my office will have a selection process that is open and transparent and i will carefully review and research the qualifications and experience that each panelist could bring to the missouri supreme court
6641462 if the selection group is picking people based on consistent qualifications based criteria its not surprising that someone picked last time like judge holliger or someone who was a strong candidate last time like judge hardwick or someone seen as a strong candidate for court appeals last time like judge fischer would be selected as people qualified for the supreme court

6641484 trading so far for the first half of the 2009 financial year has been very positive assisted by back orders we held at the beginning of the new financial year as well as particularly strong demand for our respiratory and acute care products
6641485 we now expect to achieve a first half operating profit of approximately 43m which would be an increase of approximately 38 percent on the first half last year
6641486 for the full year at current exchange rates we now expect to achieve an operating profit of approximately double the first half

6641515 ive definitely needed these few matches to get back on the right track in terms of my game i thought i mixed it up pretty well tonight and was really solid not giving her many free points and making her work for every point i also came in and really made her guess a lot so yeah im just pretty happy

6641517 shes definitely one of the young ones coming up very talented shes playing a little bit differently from the other young girls shes capable of doing different things playing a little bit soft and then suddenly changing the pace putting spin on both sides so itll probably be a little bit of different match than tonight well see how it goes

6641529 when i first arrived in the senate that first year we had a situation surrounding terri schiavo and i remember how we adjourned with a unanimous agreement that eventually allowed congress to interject itself into that decision making process of the families
6641530 it wasnt something i was comfortable with but it was not something that i stood on the floor and stopped and i think that was a mistake
6641531 the first thing id do as president is sign the freedom of choice act

6641534 we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further with the national chinese federation if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into as to why there is a discrepancy
6641535 these documents existed on a state wide website and now they dont exist and this change has taken place recently i was interested because these were documents that no one could find if theres information to be found on the internet im a citizen journalist it was a challenge
6641536 the listing in there quite clearly is he kexins birth date january 1 1994
6641537 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes
6641538 much of the coverage regarding kexins age has only mentioned allegations of fraud and the ioc has ignored the matter completely i believe that these primary documents issued by the chinese state rise to a level of evidence higher than allegation how official are these documents pretty dang official they were issued by the general administration of sport of china
6641539 my real age is 16 i dont care what other people say i want other people to know that 16 is my real age

6641548 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6641549 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6641550 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6641551 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this

6641559 you could only use embryos that were about to be discarded
6641560 i think that is a legitimate moral approach to take
6641561 no matter how a single celled human embryo comes into existence naturally or artificially it constitutes a person a nascent person but a person nonetheless
6641562 there is no scientific basis for discounting the humanity of a person at any time during her or his development yet this is exactly what our government and society condone in the case of embryonic and prenatal persons
6641563 for those of us in the pro life community this has been a great struggle and a terrible dilemma were also taught other obligations that we have as well
6641564 wildly optimistic that skin cell research which is coming more and more into focus and practicability will make this debate an economic one
6641565 r eprogrammed adult cells display this embryonic characteristic they form fatal tumors in adults
6641566 while embryonic stem cell research advocates argue that we should make use of extra embryos the bitter bitter irony is that human embryonic stem cells cannot be used at all because they form tumors and lack essential properties needed to maintain mature tissues
6641567 equivalent to abortion because in both cases innocent human beings are killed
6641568 we need your guidance and advice i know theres disagreement we had several callers who were concerned about mccains support for embryonic stem cell research im against it im not panicking on the subject because i think john is warm and wonderful and humble and open and right down the line on the rights of the vulnerable i think well get there

6641583 russia says she wants to be and we want her to be part of the normal international community the response of the west is vital
6641584 this is a straightforward act of aggression by russia not an international development issue cameron sussed that and saw that john mccain was right about where the story was going this trip by cameron just makes us look wet and dithering
6641585 we must make clear that the path russia has chosen leads to isolation and contempt we should suspend russia from the g8 and suspend negotiations on a partnership with the european union

6641607 there are people and groups at home that are planning acts of terror here or abroad
6641608 crucially the research has revealed that those who become terrorists are a diverse collection of individuals who fit no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism

6641611 on this issue we fully support russia georgia started this crisis but the west is blaming russia
6641612 the war which was triggered in georgia is the culmination of attempts to encircle and isolate russia
6641613 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important
6641614 i think we should speed it up moreover the west and israel continue to put pressure on russia
6641615 one of the aims of irans 10 year space programme is to send a manned rocket into space

6641643 a lot of the marketing of particular programs had fallen to each of the different arts schools
6641644 create one visual identity that will be used for all the programs of the school that will help reinforce that this is one institution doing a whole body of really stellar work in the arts and arts education
6641645 a new seal for the university along with graphic standards for both the logo and the seal
6641646 yes we would love to be able to devote additional funds toward new initiatives to strengthen our ongoing marketing efforts but it wont happen this year unless we are able to raise additional private dollars for it

6641652 knowingly assisted hamas and the islamic jihad to carry out terrorist attacks
6641653 for the purpose of planning preparing for and executing terrorist attacks
6641654 that depends on how big fannie and freddie blow up
6641655 theres not protection for shareholders of common or preferred shares
6641656 even if any rescue effort gives a priority to the federal government that still makes fannie and freddie more solvent
6641657 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6641658 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6641659 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6641660 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6641661 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6641662 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6641663 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6641664 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6641665 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6641666 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6641667 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6641668 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6641669 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6641670 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6641671 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

6641684 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6641685 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6641686 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6641687 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6641688 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6641689 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6641690 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6641691 i said what the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6641692 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6641693 this storm is going to be with us for a while
6641694 it needs to come and get gone so we can get back to what we were doing
6641695 the list will concentrate no 1 on all of the people who made it happen
6641696 there are these scenes in rodanthe and you just get the wind swept austere beauty of the outer banks
6641697 its co mingled with a story that im proud to have written and that translated well to film
6641698 its not often you have a movie named after the place that it actually was filmed so weve got a lot of opportunities
6641699 they hit our target market they showcase our incredible island
6641700 that we cant afford to be in on our own

6641706 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6641707 it doesnt matter if they were or werent involved in an attack today yesterday or on sept 11 2001 we seek out terrorists and we will give them the option to be captured or killed or possibly flee
6641708 we have no information allowing us to consider that french soldiers were killed under fire of nato planes

6641711 why is it that every child that comes into contact with him is broken
6641712 so you got these incredible suggestive tainted interviews and who takes over the interviews the woman who has custody of the three children
6641713 i thought things would go the justice way but justice is fickle i guess
6641714 i honestly dont know why it went the way it did this is the first time ive heard all this stuff that the d a is putting out that is not my child
6641715 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6641716 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6641717 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6641718 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6641719 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6641720 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6641721 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6641722 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6641723 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6641724 in all likelihood it appears that mandatory restrictions will be enacted however the final decision hasnt been made yet
6641725 it is a gray area because if you look at how much water they are using and how much is in the streams we are in good shape if it were much worse it would be clear
6641726 we are in the zone where mandatory conservation is probably advisable
6641727 we will try to give a little more of a warning if we get closer to those criteria
6641728 the last samurai was filmed the most beautiful place i have ever seen getting randomly treated to dinner by people i dont know going to shows and getting lost where among the few things i catagorize as
6641729 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6641730 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6641731 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6641732 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6641733 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6641734 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6641735 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6641736 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6641737 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6641738 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6641739 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6641740 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6641741 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6641742 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6641743 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6641744 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6641745 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6641746 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6641747 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6641748 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6641749 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6641750 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6641751 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6641752 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6641753 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6641754 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6641755 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds

6641766 does the presence of this chapter make it the true first edition or the second state i can never remember you see whether fathers is the missing chapter or the correct one
6641767 and dont let the bastards steal anything or spend too long in the basement if they start tapping on walls or doing any other strange shit kick them out

6641770 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
6641771 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
6641772 the vitol groups net crude futures position on the main international exchanges on the sixth of june was in fact short 11 million barrels
6641773 this short position reflects the groups extensive use of the exchanges for managing price risk on the physical oil it supplies as is standard practice throughout the oil industry
6641774 people of earth stop your bickering i am from harvard and im here to help

6641778 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6641779 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6641780 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
6641781 a violent education corporal punishment of children in u s public schools
6641782 more than 200 000 u s public school students were punished by beatings during the 2006 2007 school year
6641783 the other kids were watching and laughing it made me want to fight them when you get a paddling and you see everyone laugh at you it make you mad and you want to do something about it
6641784 all corporal punishment whether or not it causes significant physical injury represents a violation of each students rights to physical integrity and human dignity it is degrading and humiliating damaging the students self esteem and making him or her feel helpless
6641785 in the 13 southern states where corporal punishment is most prevalent african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population and african american girls are 2 1 times more likely to be paddled than might be expected

6641788 i went to the hospital to see lcpl fisher the e co
6641789 here is a marine who just lost three of his friends could easily have been no 4 of the kias and his way of honoring his friends is to re enlist to stay in the same battalion in order to return to the same place his friends were killed so that he can continue to carry the fight to the enemy and whats most important is that his actions are not an act of vengeance but an act of love a way to honor his comrades he inspires me
6641790 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but from the preponderance of the many she did not make
6641791 her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency

6641794 in case you missed it this week there was a tragedy in kansas ten thousand people died an entire town destroyed
6641795 over the last 15 months weve traveled to every corner of the united states ive now been in 57 states i think one left to go
6641796 there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma alabama because some folks are willing to march across a bridge so they got together and barack obama jr was born
6641797 we only have a certain number of them and if they are all in iraq then its harder for us to use them in afghanistan
6641798 ive made it clear for years that the threat from iran is grave
6641799 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
6641800 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade
6641801 i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last best hope on earth this was the moment this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals
6641802 you cannot in this day and age give up a month or a week
6641803 while the republican convention went on he was picking judges for western massachusetts
6641804 and the lesson was an election can be lost in august
6641805 the candidate usually keeps a low profile during the opposition convention certainly bush did in 2004
6641806 the polls are tightening youre seeing a sharper tone out of barack obama
6641807 we think he recognizes that theres a shift in this race and that the republican party independents and conservative democrats have recognized that john mccain is the candidate and the leadership that we need in the next four years
6641808 hes taken obama down a peg and he doesnt want to overplay that hand
6641809 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6641810 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6641811 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6641812 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6641813 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6641814 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6641815 the one time front runner for the republican presidential nomination has disappointing poll numbers and deathly results from the second quarter of fundraising his failed effort to push through a comprehensive immigration bill has alienated him from many conservative republican voters out of luck and money hes a man looking for love
6641816 no one has charged obama with wrongdoing something he has been quick to point out
6641817 economic problems that will make this years financial turbulence look like a trip to the debt counselors office
6641818 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6641819 schade dass ich keine medaille mit nach hause bringen kann ich habe ein super stechen gehabt ein zehntel ist sehr sehr wenig
6641820 das war sehr belastend aber ich habe versucht mich auf den sport zu konzentrieren

6641822 ich bin mit einem knopf in der m hne h ngengeblieben und konnte mich nicht mehr richtig ausbalancieren
6641823 it was certainly a rougher time where your emphasis was more on reprisal retribution punishment
6641824 we were a rudderless ship there for years and years without oversight
6641825 we finally decided to take back control of our prisons
6641826 i think the forecast of continuing violence itself played a role in moving people to take seriously the problem of violence in prison
6641827 it correlates almost directly with when we started segregating all the gang members
6641828 they may not have been the ones perpetrating the violence but they were involved in calling the shots
6641829 weve been more successful nationally dealing with the anger that many people come to prison with
6641830 certainly theres security issues anything like that has to do with an airport commercial traffic of airplanes certainly we have an interest especially after 9 11
6641831 ive achieved what i came here for and none can take it away that surely takes the pressure off my shoulders and ill be in a free state of mind tomorrow
6641832 but that does not mean ill just go through the motions today it will be the same vigour and the intensity too would remain same im going for the gold
6641833 sleep epic sleep well knowing that tomorrow is a blank canvas your life a portfolio that you give death at your funeral

6641835 there arent too many authors of note who have passed through l a in the last three decades whom connie hasnt interviewed and interviewed well
6641836 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students
6641837 digitizing these tapes will give students and others an opportunity to hear and watch these outstanding authors for themselves whenever they want
6641838 seeing authors up close like this provides a rich point of view to their work
6641839 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion
6641840 in fact drucker once described management books as dreadful trash and suggested that he derived much of his philosophy from novelists such as austen balzac and others
6641841 is a beautiful setting for the tapes to call home

6641847 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6641848 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6641849 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6641850 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6641851 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6641852 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6641853 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

6641860 los s bados d as 19 y 20 abril de 2007 hemos tenido asambleas con los afiliados a sepla y es nuestra obligaci n informarte de la elevada inquietud que reina entre los mismos por el modo en que se realiza la operaci n diaria desde hace un mes
6641861 el elevado n mero de vuelos retrasados las escalas programadas en tiempos que se escapan a la realidad la falta de recursos calidad de medios en tierra los reiterados aogs en las flotas la escasez de tripulaciones y el sistema de movimientos de los tripulantes para lograr una tripulaci n concreta hacen que el sentimiento general sea de caos operativo que hace poner en riesgo el pasaje raz n de ser de spanair

6641863 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6641864 this is a planning took where all things are going
6641865 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6641866 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6641867 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6641868 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6641869 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6641870 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6641871 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6641872 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6641873 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6641874 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6641875 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6641876 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6641877 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6641878 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6641879 for barack obama it doesnt matter if your name is hard to pronounce or where youre from whats important is working hard and getting a good education

6641883 kyoto was the capital of japan until 1868 when the capital was moved to tokyo the city is full of beautiful historical buildings and sites it should be a treat for every player that visits
6641884 honolulu was the site of one of the most exciting pro tours ever
6641885 we had an amazing turnout and we still get comments from players that went and those that didnt and would like a chance to go again every year since we were there we have discussed when we would return and now the time seems right it will have been three years since we were there but the popularity of honolulu as a pro tour site is evident and should once again allow for a spectacular show
6641886 austin is a smaller city but that is not unheard of in pro tour cities charleston is much smaller
6641887 austin is the capital of texas and has a much different feel than the rest of the state i was there in 2004 for a grand prix and was surprised about what a cool city it is lots of great restaurants night spots and history should make for a great pt stop
6641888 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff
6641889 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6641890 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6641891 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6641892 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6641893 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6641894 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6641895 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6641896 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday

6641900 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6641901 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6641902 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6641903 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is

6641905 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6641906 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes

6641910 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies
6641911 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6641912 the fundamental basis of this nations laws was given to moses on the mount the fundamental basis of our bill of rights comes from the teachings we get from exodus and st matthew from isaiah and st paul
6641913 i dont think we emphasize that enough these days if we dont have a proper fundamental moral background we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state

6641921 the noise and pollution from 10 000 vehicles a day is driving everyone crazy
6641922 i really miss doing as many interviews as i used to
6641923 i think theres something about the web vibe and i know that makes me sound very out of it to use the word vibe but im looking forward to being able to have more casual but hopefully hard hitting coverage if thats not too counter intuitive
6641924 a distinct venue to mix good food and lively political debate
6641925 its very ambitious and a huge commitment of resources i dont think by the end of fall anybody will be able to say cbs just talked about the polls and the candidates latest gaffes
6641926 talking to real people is one of my strong suits and hopefully this gives me a chance to get out its frustrating sometimes to be behind the desk all the time and not interacting with people and talking to them making people comfortable and guiding the interview and being a good listener
6641927 this will be an opportunity to do some of that
6641928 we dont know exactly what we are going to do with it
6641929 the presence of variant pronunciations indicates that not all educated speakers pronounce words the same way a second place variant is not to be regarded as less acceptable than the pronunciation that is given first

6641933 i told her i would love for her to work for me
6641934 she always had this joyful spirit always saying something nice about the next person
6641935 she hugged all of her students at the end of her class it was a ritual they curtsied and then she would embrace them
6641936 ill tell you what this is a very very aggressive schedule if they dont get this building closed in in the good weather they have a big problem
6641937 we need to get on a fast track to get the building enclosed so winter wont have an impact
6641938 we got a good jump on it right now because we were able to get so much of the steel and precast erected
6641939 i fully expect well be having lights on at night
6641940 we dont think its going to be a substantial or significant impact fans will have to make some adjustments but we dont think its going to dramatically affect traffic flows
6641941 the continued development of the north shore is a positive for the city but we can expect to deal with some traffic issues due to construction during the process
6641942 we continue to recommend that people take advantage of the many downtown parking options available to them and we will regularly update our fans on the best possible alternative routes to take on steelers game days and for heinz field events
6641943 we wanted to do an environmental showcase on a modest budget
6641944 if an energy star house is 5 000 more thats inconsequential on a 30 year mortgage
6641945 being sustainable is a natural extension of our mission as a model for a healthy environment and doing the right thing
6641946 its getting to the point where its irresponsible not to
6641947 we are aware of that incident and we are looking into it
6641948 its mind boggling to think that 1 billion people are currently without the most basic human need
6641949 water is extremely important and im happy that this is helping

6641951 i get in my own little world when i swim endurance events are sort of like an active form of meditation for me it brings me peace
6641952 im sick of it im sick of the whole industry
6641953 im frustrated broken hearted i cant make money at it anymore
6641954 why are there three record shops in this city when there once was 167
6641955 i loved this business but 15 years ago the industry started dropping out from the independents and going with the mass merchandisers best buy circuit city and wal mart and those three places sell cds below cost my cost from a distributor is 12 97 theyre retailing them at 10 99
6641956 the city could have helped by supporting this collection as a museum
6641957 the heinz history center said theyd take the records by the local pittsburgh artists but i wouldnt split that out of my collection
6641958 now on a saturday if i do 200 today its a miracle
6641959 pittsburgh is such a famous city for music do you think anybody knows that
6641960 they dont even know the artists i go to their funerals and theres nobody there some of the people who wrote some of the grandest music that exists and they dont even know who the hell they are
6641961 this is an historic agreement there are only improvements there are no steps back

6641965 he and i became really good friends we were there in the tough times in the good times too
6641966 he is really going to be missed in the nfl and by football generally
6641967 obviously life moves on but i dont know that anybody can replace gene upshaw
6641968 the games the most important thing and thats what youre trying to protect
6641969 he saw that and i saw that with him we just started that and as you do with friendship youre with people for a time when i had my 50th wedding anniversary he and his wife terry came we had that kind of relationship
6641970 he came to my fathers and my mothers funerals we were pretty close
6641971 i played against him when i was with the houston oilers and he was with the raiders he was a great player his leadership will be missed by all in the nfl
6641972 i think overall for the players you can throw darts at gene all over the board but he did far more than anybody who ever started in this business free agency and where the system is is far better than any player ever imagined
6641973 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6641974 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6641975 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6641976 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6641977 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6641978 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6641979 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6641980 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6641981 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6641982 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6641983 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6641984 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6641985 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6641986 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6641987 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6641988 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6641989 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6641990 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6641991 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6641992 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6641993 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6641994 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6641995 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6641996 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6641997 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6641998 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6641999 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6642000 and who are not about ego self aggrandizement getting their names in the press
6642001 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6642002 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6642003 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6642004 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6642005 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6642006 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6642007 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6642008 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6642009 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6642010 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6642011 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6642012 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6642013 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6642014 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6642015 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6642016 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6642017 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6642018 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6642019 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6642020 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6642021 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6642022 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6642023 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6642024 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6642025 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6642026 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6642027 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6642028 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6642029 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6642030 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6642031 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6642032 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6642033 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6642034 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6642035 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6642036 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6642037 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6642038 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6642039 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6642040 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6642041 this is a very solid showing for senator obama in historical terms its a showing that augurs well for him
6642042 the more you like senator clinton the more likely you are to be for senator obama
6642043 look the clintons are dirty how many times do the republicans need to throw that in our faces turn the page they did most of the stuff that the republicans said they did whitewater catte futures filegate travelgate gennifer flowers katherina wilkie monica lewinsky turn the page
6642044 never walk over others in climbing the ladder to success you just might meet them on your way down
6642045 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you
6642046 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6642047 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6642048 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6642049 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6642050 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6642051 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6642052 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6642053 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6642054 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6642055 because approving a second choice may help defeat the voters first choice it is likely to devolve to typical vote for one plurality voting
6642056 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6642057 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6642058 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6642059 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6642060 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6642061 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6642062 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6642063 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6642064 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6642065 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6642066 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6642067 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6642068 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6642069 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6642070 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6642071 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6642072 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically
6642073 bowing to pressure from environmental groups the florida senate recently passed a bill backed by gov charlie crist that would eventually shut down six pipes that carry waste water into the atlantic from miami dade broward and palm beach counties
6642074 people are getting smart on the bs behind mmgw and that is exactly why algore is trying to recruit
6642075 no trippin we just have to stop dumping raw feces and piss into the ocean simple
6642076 i didnt know what to expect some kind of moonscape perhaps but it was incredible huge matrices of branching porites coral up to 8 meters 25 feet high had established creating a thriving coral reef habitat
6642077 throughout other parts of the lagoon it was awesome to see coral cover as high as 80 percent and large tree like branching coral formations with trunks 30 centimeters 12 inches thick
6642078 it seems like you won approval from all who write bs on every subject every day the know it alls stay true to yourself never change to please others or to fit in
6642079 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6642080 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6642081 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6642082 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6642083 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6642084 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6642085 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6642086 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6642087 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6642088 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6642089 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6642090 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6642091 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6642092 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6642093 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6642094 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6642095 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6642096 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6642097 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6642098 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6642099 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6642100 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6642101 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6642102 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6642103 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6642104 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6642105 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6642106 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6642107 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6642108 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6642109 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6642110 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6642111 mister you will feel better letting it out but please dont put any on my shoes they are new
6642112 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6642113 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6642114 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6642115 they told me there are going to be resources here
6642116 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6642117 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6642118 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6642119 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6642120 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6642121 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6642122 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6642123 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6642124 my daughter has taught me more than i could ever imagine including that you need to take the time to stop and smell the roses or watch the ants as they take food to there home

6642157 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6642158 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6642159 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6642160 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6642161 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6642162 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6642163 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6642164 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6642165 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6642166 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6642167 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6642168 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6642169 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6642170 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6642171 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6642172 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6642173 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6642174 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6642175 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6642176 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6642177 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6642178 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6642179 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6642180 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6642181 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6642182 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6642183 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6642184 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6642185 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6642186 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6642187 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6642188 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6642189 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6642190 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6642191 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6642192 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6642193 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6642194 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6642195 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6642196 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6642197 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6642198 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6642199 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6642200 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6642201 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6642202 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6642203 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6642204 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6642205 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6642206 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6642207 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6642208 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6642209 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6642210 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6642211 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6642212 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6642213 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6642214 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6642215 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6642216 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6642217 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6642218 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6642219 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6642220 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6642221 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6642222 with the value of hindsight our 42m capital raising late last year was well timed and this coupled with strong trading profits and cash flows provides ebos with an excellent base from which to continue to pursue new growth opportunities
6642223 we expect our regular trading markets to remain competitive with some softness in the retail environment
6642224 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6642225 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6642226 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6642227 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6642228 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6642229 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6642230 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6642231 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6642232 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6642233 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6642234 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6642235 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6642236 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6642237 the minute we accomplish that we will have done everything asked of us
6642238 so i have to ask you howd you go from living on the upper eastside to st louis
6642239 i moved there for him he was gorgeous he was talented he was sexy view previous topic
6642240 nobody else is gonna come along to develop something like this in the city so we need to take whatever we can get
6642241 legal and easy way for elected officials to reward their biggest contributors
6642242 chief asset and most reliable tool for economic development is our historic architecture
6642243 chief asset and most reliable tool for economic development is our historic architecture
6642244 chief asset and most reliable tool for economic development is our historic architecture
6642245 mom i really dont wanna talk about it can we maybe talk about it another time
6642246 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism
6642247 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
6642248 musharrafs departure signals the end of a de facto presidential form of government in pakistan
6642249 he had concentrated power in his own hands by virtue of the fact that he was also head of the military
6642250 both the pakistanis and the americans are going to have to decide what kind of policies they follow with regard to foreign affairs and economics and that will depend in no small measure on the attitude that the us congress and a new us president will bring to the entire region
6642251 i hope all of pakistans friends will now seize the opportunity created by musharrafs exit to focus on the urgent issues of today confronting the threat of extremist violence dealing with food and energy shortages and helping the pakistani people build a stable secure democratic future
6642252 i hope that the elections for president musharrafs successor will serve to reconcile the pakistani people behind a leader who can solidify their government internally
6642253 colorado and the west are both a big focus of this campaign
6642254 that investment and the energy that we see on the ground in new mexico will absolutely translate in november
6642255 in a place like montana there simply werent the resources to keep a party headquarters opened during the entire year in non election years and so it was very difficult
6642256 it kept people on the ground recruiting new candidates maintaining voter files making sure we have county committees that are working and organized
6642257 the government not telling you how to live your life and what to do
6642258 i think that i have a lifetime of experience that i will bring to the white house
6642259 that obama told the people of new hampshire that he has a kansas accent because his mother was from there is nonsense and a cover up
6642260 the result demonstrates that paranoid dysfunction breeds the impulse to hoard
6642261 experts generally agree that clintons campaign was not prepared for a lengthy fight it had an insufficient delegate operation it squandered vast sums of money and the candidate herself evinced a paralyzing schizophrenia
6642262 hillarys orchestrating a play within the play in denver just as hamlet used the device to show that his stepfather murdered his father hillary will try to show the democrats they chose the wrong savior
6642263 hillary clinton feels no guilt about encouraging her supporters to mess up barack obamas big moment thus undermining his odds of beating john mccain
6642264 you can almost hear her mind whirring shes amazed at how easy it was to snatch denver away from the obama saps
6642265 like taking candy from a baby except bean pole guy doesnt eat candy
6642266 in just a couple of weeks bill and hill were able to drag no drama obama into a swamp of clinton drama
6642267 now theyve made barrys convention all about them their dissatisfaction and revisionism and barely disguised desire to see him fail whatever insincere words of support the clintons muster their primal scream gets louder he cant win he cant close the deal we told you so yes she can
6642268 love o darling is drown on the moons face engraved on birds feathers amp rain drops but any girl would have the opportunity to find it ends up throwing it with thousands stones
6642269 the vehicle failed shortly after liftoff and in no way reached its intended position
6642270 its always difficult with scene examinations to know exactly how long its going to take but just from experience id suggests were going to be there for a number of days at least through to saturday sunday and maybe even next week
6642271 the party atmosphere involved excessive use of alcohol casual sex seems also to have been part of it
6642272 it is clear that in the atmosphere that then prevailed in which mr owen was an enthusiastic participant consent to sexual intercourse was mostly assumed never respectfully sought
6642273 it is shocking that the union would act like this
6642274 it is no different to any other workplace there are requirements when an employee wants to undertake activities outside their employment that have the potential to bear upon their employment and they are required to get the approval of the employer to do that
6642275 that is the issue between us that we are resolving at the moment
6642276 our vet staff are confident that the recent bout of cold weather in wellington has not been a factor in her death
6642277 there were no outward signs she was not feeling well
6642278 we dont expect the situation to deteriorate but we would be remiss in our duty not have a plan in place in the event the situation did deteriorate
6642279 if however the airport at nadi was closed then we would have to consider whether a military evacuation by air or by sea was necessary
6642280 we would work with what ever government was in place in fiji to try to get their concurrence if that was not possible then in the last instance the lives and the well being of our citizens would be paramount and we would do it with or without that concurrence
6642281 perdi mas fiz a minha parte bem feito infelizmente no entanto meu advers rio foi melhor
6642282 he was so nice he bought me this and that
6642283 joe famm was a scrappy colorful street talking reporter and an unforgettable
6642284 this is why we learn pick up guys so when your dream girl comes along you have the skills to get her to not let her walk away from your life
6642285 its ok because i know you love me like a little brother
6642286 let me know when you get home and ill come over
6642287 fuck i cant get rid of my friends drive my blonde friend back to my house so you have an excuse to come over
6642288 great my last name is kim so im set right
6642289 the screen is really at the forefront of the experience
6642290 that really steps it up in terms of the browsing experience you can get the streaming experience you can get
6642291 all the stuff you used to have to go back to the office for
6642292 theres a lot of business usage as well as a lot of personal usage
6642293 its that blurring of personal and professional life as the day goes on
6642294 of the mobile system youre getting a lot of requirements from the it department
6642295 its still one of the largest inhibitors of deploying a mobile solution
6642296 the nice thing about facial recognition is its got more barriers to duplication
6642297 can leave a print or pattern behind that can be lifted or utilized
6642298 using a 2d of a 3d obviously one of the big factors is going to be how you position yourself in front of the camera
6642299 which following technology tools does your firm use or plan to use in the next five years for internal employee communication
6642300 do not use and or do not plan to use
6642301 when a company does go to technology they are looking for some sort of roi numbers and sometimes its hard to calculate right away it will take a while to make sure enough people in the company use the tool to be able to measure it
6642302 if you have firewalls in the way what one business is using internally the business right next door to them has no idea whats going on there or what value they might be getting out of it so its really hard for ideas when they do work to spread
6642303 i think also some of the best tools are coming out of companies who arent the established it providers smaller startups who dont have the distribution and the marketing reach necessary to get their story out there
6642304 its been really slow for businesses to discover some of the values of social technology but at the same time a lot of social technology providers have had a tough time marketing to business or even necessarily adopting their products ideally for business as opposed to a consumer environment
6642305 on the consumer side blogs have definitely been here for a while and have been used a lot but on the business side not a lot of companies are doing it i see a lot more companies using blogs internally for maybe their collaboration tools or for their projects but not necessarily externally communicating to their customers or their clients
6642306 blogs and wikis were version 1 0 of web 2 0
6642307 they were like direct lets take a few tools that have worked in wikipedia with the blogosphere and lets just bring them straight into the enterprise i think you have to do a little bit more work than that to make tools that really work in a business environment
6642308 companies before they implement something they try to make sure that its going to be useful and theres some sort of roi in time saved or travel saved
6642309 anyone under the age of 30 these days is used to using social tools on the internet to come into an enterprise environment where everything runs through outlook is just strange and its an alien experience for them
6642310 tools that empower employees and let the leadership emerge within organizations is going to be important
6642311 in order to have those interactions you have to know who in your organization you should be talking to or what conversations to be having being aware of whats going on in your organization and knowing who to pick up the phone and call is just as important as having that conversation
6642312 il ny a pas de pain pas de nourriture pas de m dicaments les gens meurent ici
6642313 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6642314 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6642315 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6642316 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6642317 other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6642318 we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later
6642319 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment
6642320 all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6642321 the outlook going forward for 2009 were saying the market is a difficult market were saying the market conditions are probably the worst anyone has seen for a long period of time chief executive greg goodman said
6642322 but we are comfortable and confident of targeting eps growth in 2009 of 6 per cent and that is subject to no material deterioration in the market from where we sit at the moment
6642323 this result is largely due to organic growth mr goodman said
6642324 we have 371 investment properties under management and 97 developments globally giving us the benefit of significant geographic and earnings diversity
6642325 this has enabled us to navigate through a difficult period while no one can forecast when broader market conditions will improve we believe that our business is in good shape to operate through the current cycle
6642326 we have been waiting for this moment for 15 years
6642327 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies
6642328 they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
6642329 esos son niveles mucho m s sostenibles niveles que nos dan el espacio para reaccionar si en caso hubiera una recesi n mundial o si enfrentamos un problema originado por un desastre natural
6642330 debemos seguir tratando de evitar que los precios de los alimentos y los combustibles pasen al resto de la econom a si bien es cierto que debemos tener unos precios m s realistas en los combustibles tenemos que evitar que se propaguen sus impactos en los dem s precios ese es un objetivo importante
6642331 hay una tendencia creciente al aumento de los cr ditos de consumo que es preocupante
6642332 no se puede permitir que haya relajamiento de los criterios prudenciales para ninguna entidad financiera
6642333 la sbs tiene que estar muy segura que los criterios prudenciales son estrictos y son fielmente implementados no debe haber ninguna disculpa para ninguna entidad financiera de mantener en su cartera cr ditos de dudoso recobro porque eso afecta la calidad del sistema financiero la confianza de la poblaci n y la capacidad de ahorro del sistema

6642336 as a wii owner and lover since launch i have been awaiting for many moons any evidence that pointed to nibris sadness as being a real game not some joke having gone through various stories confirming the game would actually be made or not including the confirmation that it would be using the gamebryo engene made by emergent oblivion fallout 3 sid meier games like pirates and civilization iv i still was not satisfied until now the proof i was looking for
6642337 no chief executive likes to be in the position that i find myself today it is not anzs finest hour
6642338 the bottom line is we were in a business that we should never have entered into in the first place and it was in a business environment where the risks werent properly understood and werent properly managed
6642339 at the most basic level staff in the business didnt understand the reputational risks and the differences between managing a securities lending business and an equity finance business
6642340 we then compounded the problems by not having the usual risk controls and governance procedures in place
6642341 the review committee found that because of these failings these issues were never given the proper attention and oversight and in particular were not escalated to the ceo to the board committees or to the board in the way that they should have been
6642342 so this is what we found and it is clearly unacceptable
6642343 a number of employees have had formal notes placed on employment records and cuts to their remuneration eight managers and executives will leave anz this includes two members of the management board peter hodgson and david stephen
6642344 more would have been affected if they still had been at anz
6642345 right you know i made my bed and i have to lie in it i cant say that i am enjoying myself every day but you know i still think we have got huge potential with this business
6642346 she aniston is so intent on getting married and having children he felt hemmed in
6642347 after a 20 minute phone conversation he just said i cant take it any more and hung up then he texted thats it the end
6642348 its the most normal thing in the world theres no lying theres no cheating theres no nothing
6642349 ours is behaving in a similar way were actually looking okay he said
6642350 its been led mainly by the resources the banks were lagging and now the banks have picked up
6642351 the most famous reaction to the half blood prince delay
6642352 its had a couple of rallies up toward these levels and its just failed mr vrondas said
6642353 i think todays move is just a little bit of profit taking really
6642354 if we see some demand for euro against the us dollar when europe steps in then that will probably help the aussie mr vrondas said
6642355 it appears as though the market is still relatively buoyed at the moment on the back of the performance in commodities
6642356 we might see a bit more of a pullback in the us dollar
6642357 because historically because historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution
6642358 whoooao shake it up youre like bad medicine rah rah loud obnoxious
6642359 what brought you here where do you live how do you live are you happy

6642372 the basic idea is that people should not be forced to say or to do things they believe are morally wrong in particular health care professionals should not be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience
6642373 freedom of expression and action are unfit barter for admission to medical employment or training
6642374 by leaving the term abortion undefined the regulations create all sort of space for ideology and political views to insinuate themselves into medical practices emergency rooms and clinics all across the country and when that happens women will suffer
6642375 in a field where were already losing a disproportionate number of doctors this would enable them not only to stay but also maybe to recruit more doctors who are highly qualified and can provide quality care to their patients
6642376 my private part died today and i am very sad

6642384 today we practiced a little like it was a monday practice which means we started some primary preparations for our first game of the season against clemson i think the biggest thing we are trying to get our players to learn to do is how to prepare for a game everybody on the team has a role for preparation for a game
6642385 we did a little bit more today than we usually do i think it was a good start i was pleased with the players intensity and attitude towards trying to learn you always make mistakes but that is why you practice
6642386 we have had a good camp and had a good chance to evaluate most of the players we kind of know who we are going to go out there and work with in some cases we are working with more than one player at a certain position those things may not be decided until game day
6642387 we had no idea that once you get married you have to eat off of one plate it also cuts the doing dishes time in half being married is great
6642388 we posed for this picture before dinner and then we got stuck like that for half an hour im never wearing that much hairspray again
6642389 i spotted joe quickly but he was trying to hide from the crowds by tucking in between a few people
6642390 he was wearing a baseball cap and real casual dress so he wouldnt stand out
6642391 hes an amazing guy and anybody would be lucky to be dating him
6642392 shes a great girl i think anybody would love to go on a date with her
6642393 just make it to the next switch just do it come on legs
6642394 i will pit my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains any time any time
6642395 and i think an objective analysis will say that ive been right a lot more than he has for all that time that hes spent in washington
6642396 that doesnt mean though that i know everything ive got to have good smart advisers around me i already do
6642397 my mother taught me that if you dont have anything good to say about anybody you just shouldnt say anything
6642398 i will say that the kind of politics thats all about division and resentment and making people mad at each other hasnt gotten us very far
6642399 it may help you win elections but it sure hasnt put more income in the american family budget it hasnt brought down gas prices it hasnt made college easy to finance
6642400 who does something like that what kind of values are those to make stuff up about people
6642401 no person except a natural born citizen or a citizen of the united states at the time of the adoption of this constitution shall be eligible to the office of president neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained the age of thirty five years and been fourteen years a resident within the united states
6642402 today the denunciations of mr mccain seemed to flow a little more easily especially after mr mccain handed him the gift of not remembering how many houses he owned
6642403 the office of president is filled by whomever best reflects the mood of american citizens at a particular point in time
6642404 the mood the constitution was written with the understanding that voters would use their judgment based on information they learned about the candidate from the free press among the sources you carly should not vote if you are in a bad mood that day who are you voting for and if you are in a good mood good to see obamas poll numbers have made his campaign wake up and realize that the high road rarely leads to pennsylvania avenue theres more than enough to hit back mccain on foreign policy as well fox reporter back in 2003

6642424 if he was standing in judgment of cases and was somehow impaired that could be fertile ground for defense lawyers and perhaps prosecutors to ask for a reconsideration of his rulings you assume a judge is mentally stable
6642425 certainly you never want to kick somebody when theyre down but you have an obligation to your client

6642433 i want to let the public know i am a sensitive easy going guy that wishes this whole incident didnt happen id like channel 7 news to know that im sorry for this negative attention that you julie and your station has received in no way shape or form had this incident been premeditated or was supposed to happen at all

6642441 kids get scared easily wherever the child is its not right because right now that little boy is crying for his mother
6642442 our biggest concern has been trying to figure out how bobby jr and amanda are going to react as time passes
6642443 we say that their mommy and daddy are angels we try as best we can to let them know that even though they may not be able to see mommy and daddy right now they are right here and always with them
6642444 its not time to tell bobby and amanda why they cant see their parents theyre angels we say its hard to see angels but theyre always here always right beside you watching over you every minute mommy and daddy see you all the time
6642445 no they dont really understand still in their eyes sometimes you can see they know something isnt right
6642446 usually when it was just a back and forth visit like that one was going to be donna stayed home with the kids
6642447 i finally was able to cry yes but i still cant believe theyre gone its just too awful too horrible its a tragedy when a child loses one parent but to lose two i dont know how to deal with that
6642448 shes asked me to bring my son and daughter who are the same age over to play with bobby and amanda
6642449 the kids will have fun but it will be strange for me to be in bob and donnas house and not have them there

6642469 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6642470 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6642471 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6642472 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6642481 he was a good kid who was dealt some bad cards in life
6642482 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school
6642483 i want to assure parents and others in this community that despite this tragic and isolated incident that our schools are safe
6642484 i wish to god that i could answer that persistent question that i have heard all day long

6642492 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6642493 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6642494 why are they going to go back to their country and pay someone to bring them over here again

6642496 at a press conference in 1997 the dalai lama said from a buddhist point of view lesbian and gay sex is generally considered sexual misconduct he very soon found that he had stumbled into a pink minefield when some western buddhists a significant number of who are gay loudly expressed their outrage together with promoting the dhamma the dalai lamas main purpose in touring the west is to win support for his cause and to this end he defiantly does not want to alienate anyone as soon as he realized what he had done he immediately back peddled he called a meeting with gay and lesbian representatives during which he expressed the willingness to consider the possibility that some of the teachings may be specific to a particular cultural and historic context dawa tsering spokesperson for the office of tibet released a suitably politically correct and safe statement his holiness opposes violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation he urges respect tolerance compassion and the full recognition of human rights for all ruffled feathers were smoothed gay western tibetan buddhists left convinced that the dalai lama approved of their sexual orientation and the dalai lama continued believing that homosexuality is wrong only now making a careful note never to say so again in public
6642497 what conclusion can we draw to invite the gods ruins our relationship with them but sets history in motion a life in which the gods are not invited isnt worth living it will be quieter but there wont be any stories and you could suppose that these dangerous invitations were in fact contrived by the gods themselves because the gods get bored with men who have no stories roberto calasso the marriage of cadmus and harmony

6642502 the party that is in power is the party of benazir bhutto many of the christians felt like the party would offer more protection to them more protection for their churches more freedom to worship so i think the hope is that this party would follow through on some of bhuttos ideas and ideals

6642506 some of the christians who receive these packs actually in turn share them with muslim neighbors

6642530 it was a combination of his role on the present club and on future clubs as well as the value and compensation associated with that role
6642531 we might get a player whos a better fit long term for us
6642532 no i think last year it was definitely a big relief that was the first time i had faced a situation like that possibly picking up and moving and wearing a different uniform second time around maybe it was a little easier to take
6642533 the part that was hard actually was losing those other two guys
6642534 honestly i dont know whats going to happen with me this offseason i really dont so yeah you go out on the field with that feeling that hey this might be my last month and a half in a pittsburgh uniform and i want to end it as well as i can
6642535 those people have been through a lot and i feel like ive been through it with them
6642536 jack wilson is such a huge part of the pirates
6642537 i dont know the direction of shortstop for this team i can see theyve made their direction as far as the team goes building with young guys so i hope to find that out as soon as i can
6642538 jacks been in a pirates uniform a long time and between him and freddy those probably are our most recognizable players
6642539 the reality is that we cant make emotional decisions on any player jack certainly has proven his worth again defensively and we can see that the whole club solidified with him out there but we always need to leave ourselves the ability to make the team better jack hopefully will be a big part of this turnaround going forward but as it was with jason and xavier and damaso marte if the right baseball trade is out there well have to entertain it
6642540 well i laid down odds on that last year and i was wrong
6642541 but no matter what ill keep going out there every day with the same attitude ive always had
6642542 if he makes it back after this work today i think in the next couple days hell be practicing full speed with us
6642543 hes positioning himself to be the no 1 guy he came in in that position if he can show us that hes ready its likely that wed go that way
6642544 we liked the way pavano was throwing the ball and we felt that hughes needed some more work
6642545 hes pitched in big games before hes pitched in the playoffs youre not talking about a kid coming up that is a rookie and doesnt have a ton of innings under his belt in the big leagues
6642546 were expecting him to throw well and keep us in the game and give us an opportunity if he can go six innings it would be great
6642547 i think what everyone is interested in and clearly what the community has consistently told us is that they want to maintain that quality of orchestra in pittsburgh
6642548 we realize we owe it to this city and the people who made the orchestra great every contract is a homage to the past
6642549 but maintain that nebulous connection that accomplishment equals legacy equals career goals sometimes you cant separate the two money and prestige
6642550 the economic downturn which happened around 2000 2001 for a lot of nonprofit organizations was not over when it was over for the rest of the country
6642551 for a lot of nonprofit organizations that was one of the longest periods of a downturn that we had gone through we were only two years into a recovery maybe three when it started all over again it is not a typical cycle this decade has been particularly difficult
6642552 pittsburgh is a smaller city than it used to be so we need to be very efficient about finding resources and utilizing them
6642553 they enhance the reputation of the city and help bring in money too in allegheny county the pittsburgh arts industry is a 341 million regional business
6642554 an orchestra of the reputation and historical significance of pittsburgh adds so much value to a city it is an enticement for business and it spreads the name of the city internationally
6642555 the talks are cordial and we intend on coming on some sort of agreement
6642556 the question is how much benefit does having one of the world class orchestras so intrinsically recognized with your city what is that value to the city the message of an orchestra to its community has to be one of investing
6642557 especially since we were in a game situation from start to finish
6642558 it wasnt outstanding one way or the other but ill take that
6642559 but its better to get them out now as opposed to on game day
6642560 probably as healthy as hes been in camp right now
6642561 i dont think weve ever been this healthy at this time of year

6642576 this is a win win proposal for unitholders to unlock value now compared to the price the market has been prepared to trade their units
6642577 at the same time it allows unitholders to maintain exposure to the core investment strategy of the fund
6642578 the board believes that it is in the best interests of all unitholders to de list the fund from the asx and to introduce a series of redemption facilities to provide unit holders in the fund with liquidity should they desire it once the fund is de listed
6642579 we are confident that the proposal provides a value enhancing solution for our unitholders
6642580 it balances the interests of unitholders who wish to redeem from the fund in the short term while preserving the integrity of the underlying investment strategy for unit holders who have invested for the long term

6642603 there was a time when it did not rain we offered prayers and it rained since then we have started this festival
6642604 we pray to god that there should be adequate rains this year that is why we take out these bhujerias
6642605 i think that it strikes a chord i think it makes people aware that this is a serious offense
6642606 whether it was simply not feeding them enough or whether it was some type of mystery ailment as he had alleged he knew how to get the dogs help and he failed to do it
6642607 his deliberate indifference to the dogs suffering really is tragic and regrettable and it was wholly avoidable
6642608 i think the fact that he pleaded guilty demonstrates his recognition of the strength of the commonwealths case
6642609 im confident that we can work out a separation agreement
6642610 whether we have an interim superintendent or a new superintendent i hope that they will take a look at the decision process to eliminate the hubert kindergarten principal
6642611 i think what is in place right now will have to suffice for the year
6642612 i think we hired approximately 20 teachers this year but that was a combination of retirements and people leaving
6642613 every year we have individual teachers leaving i dont think thats changed
6642614 a high school kid can definitely take a bike when its sunny

6642619 is applicable for every chick youre interested in and to be honest vice versa the sooner you realize this the better off youll be
6642620 you dont need to be sweating anyone that hard dog and to be perfectly honest
6642621 i dont think you can just look at the mortality but i think its part and parcel of improving patient care and safety
6642622 theyre not even realizing the outcomes might be better at the hospital they pay 40 percent less for
6642623 we put a lot of stake in the numbers we spend a lot of time working to improve our system
6642624 for hospitals that take this seriously our numbers are even better than they were a year ago
6642625 most hospitals are much better than they were before this initiative started
6642626 its always been there but as cremation has increased the effort and the time involved in searching out families has been increased its sad
6642627 they were regulations we were dealing with before and not laws
6642628 thats why funeral homes kept the ashes the responsibility has really never been clearly defined
6642629 who knows when someone could show up and say they want them
6642630 youre responsible forever because if someone comes back in 20 years and says wheres dad
6642631 you can explain to a family we hold the ashes for a year then its up to our discretion
6642632 i think its nice to have the law to fall back on
6642633 personally i would probably just hold them id feel more comfortable knowing the cremains were there and if somebody did come along i can say theyre here
6642634 we had everything carefully stored and labeled so it was no problem
6642635 but further back a lot of people thought once someone was cremated that was the end of the process because more people are being cremated what to do with the ashes is part of the discussion now
6642636 we have not run into a situation where we cannot get in touch with a person
6642637 when the ashes come back we notify the family member weve been making arrangements with
6642638 the big deal is out of respect for these people

6642666 we have a good chance if everything continues to go the right way
6642667 i was locating my fastball and thats always the key to success
6642668 when i pitch well i also work very fast and i dont throw a lot of pitches thats exactly what happened tonight
6642669 i feel more comfortable at the plate and right now it feels like something just clicked
6642670 the hitters were uncomfortable and they didnt have time to think tonight
6642671 and if we dont make the playoffs its going to take a heck of a run by the teams in front of us were going to catch them i dont see a way we wouldnt
6642672 our team is just so good from top to bottom though its one of those things that it doesnt matter where you hit you just have to capitalize when you get the chance
6642673 oigan bien hasta ahora no he hablado ni visitado al se or presidente de la rep blica pero si fuere necesario en provecho de nuestros prop sitos lo har sin temor
6642674 uh i think i want to try zoloft now i kinda like that little happy pill thing that bounces around on tv hes cute

6642676 withdrawal effects cause severe problems in more than half the users that try to come off the drug slow tapering helps somewhat but the effects are still horrific solution if withdrawal symptoms occur is to continue to take the drug not a good solution the withdrawal can happen even if not coming off the drug but just taking it as prescribed eli lilly does not offer a tapering schedule to minimize the effects they do not offer the drug in doses conducive to tapering they created a drug that may or may not help depression and they make it impossible to get off of it their solution is to keep taking it what a great company so concerned about the effects on the patients they dont care about people they care about money

6642681 its fun pitching in games like that especially against good teams
6642682 its nice to have those runs and you can go out and be aggressive
6642683 my sinker wasnt there my slider wasnt there and my changeup wasnt there i was just pitching expletive
6642684 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6642685 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6642686 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses

6642697 i thought i saw the ball pretty good when i go to catch it i couldnt see it
6642698 he got five of the first six hits on the ground
6642699 the bottom line was that we couldnt hit the ball
6642700 brandon pitched seven innings but we couldnt get him any run production the other pitcher was equally as effective and he just kept the ball low on us and we couldnt get the ball out of the infield
6642701 this is a major artery and traffic has been detoured through residential streets for more than five months
6642702 the noise and pollution from 10 000 vehicles a day is driving everyone crazy
6642703 members of unite here and citizen action are concerned that this developer may choose to accept the subsidy yet still provide inadequate health benefits for hotel workers undercutting area hotel standards and pushing hotel workers onto public assistance
6642704 that are as good or in fact exceed union operating requirements
6642705 further despite repeated meetings with the union we have yet to understand what specific economic benefit goes to the employee above what we have always offered
6642706 if the city would like to have the project operated as a union facility it will need to provide the funds necessary as it is simply not supported by the economics in this market
6642707 we are aware of that incident and we are looking into it
6642708 its mind boggling to think that 1 billion people are currently without the most basic human need
6642709 water is extremely important and im happy that this is helping
6642710 theres some days that i would like not to be looking at cloudy water but i do have an imaginative mind
6642711 i get in my own little world when i swim endurance events are sort of like an active form of meditation for me it brings me peace
6642712 im sick of it im sick of the whole industry
6642713 im frustrated broken hearted i cant make money at it anymore
6642714 why are there three record shops in this city when there once was 167
6642715 i loved this business but 15 years ago the industry started dropping out from the independents and going with the mass merchandisers best buy circuit city and wal mart and those three places sell cds below cost my cost from a distributor is 12 97 theyre retailing them at 10 99
6642716 the city could have helped by supporting this collection as a museum
6642717 the heinz history center said theyd take the records by the local pittsburgh artists but i wouldnt split that out of my collection
6642718 now on a saturday if i do 200 today its a miracle
6642719 pittsburgh is such a famous city for music do you think anybody knows that
6642720 they dont even know the artists i go to their funerals and theres nobody there some of the people who wrote some of the grandest music that exists and they dont even know who the hell they are
6642721 at the end of fiscal 2009 the turnpike would have done everything possible to avoid a toll increase
6642722 at that time if in my judgment other nontoll revenue options do not occur the board will vote for an increase knowing that no stone would have been left unturned
6642723 the only way to get out of this is to really look at the whole picture otherwise were going to be dealing with toll increases again and again and again
6642724 the least fair thing is to impose a toll increase on the tollpayers who have been saddled with 1 2 billion in debt for something which people are using without cost
6642725 to me its the ultimate unfairness and i think thats the legislatures responsibility to fix
6642726 if we had an excellent solution that didnt do some level of damage to some constituency i think we would have done it by now
6642727 we are facing a whole series of bad options if its not the bondholders its the tollpayers if its not the tollpayers it will be some other constituency
6642728 we wanted to do an environmental showcase on a modest budget
6642729 if an energy star house is 5 000 more thats inconsequential on a 30 year mortgage
6642730 being sustainable is a natural extension of our mission as a model for a healthy environment and doing the right thing
6642731 its getting to the point where its irresponsible not to
6642732 he and i became really good friends we were there in the tough times in the good times too
6642733 he is really going to be missed in the nfl and by football generally
6642734 obviously life moves on but i dont know that anybody can replace gene upshaw
6642735 the games the most important thing and thats what youre trying to protect
6642736 he saw that and i saw that with him we just started that and as you do with friendship youre with people for a time when i had my 50th wedding anniversary he and his wife terry came we had that kind of relationship
6642737 he came to my fathers and my mothers funerals we were pretty close
6642738 i played against him when i was with the houston oilers and he was with the raiders he was a great player his leadership will be missed by all in the nfl
6642739 i think overall for the players you can throw darts at gene all over the board but he did far more than anybody who ever started in this business free agency and where the system is is far better than any player ever imagined
6642740 the presence of variant pronunciations indicates that not all educated speakers pronounce words the same way a second place variant is not to be regarded as less acceptable than the pronunciation that is given first
6642741 the requirements of the printed page are such that one must precede the other
6642742 ive been coming to big spring since 1957 when my uncle gene farmed at lomax
6642743 i chose webb air force base for my pilot training in 1972 because it was 80 miles from paint creek grand old buildings like this have an extraordinary story to tell but this is not just about a building
6642744 its about good neighbors who go out and strip somebodys cotton when they have something go rough and tough in their life its a reflection of our spirit of individualism as texans and a celebration of family and friends
6642745 coming out of paint creek north of abilene in haskell county i thought this was the biggest building in texas
6642746 bringing the settles back into the glorious shape it was in in the 1930s and 40s is going to be a great asset
6642747 oh no we had 40s music with a local big band
6642748 it will give us an opportunity to open up more businesses and bring more people downtown
6642749 i have looked at this building all the years ive been here and im so excited it will be refurbished
6642750 it will generate new jobs and do something for the attitude and morale of the community to see this building restored
6642751 ill tell you what this is a very very aggressive schedule if they dont get this building closed in in the good weather they have a big problem
6642752 we need to get on a fast track to get the building enclosed so winter wont have an impact
6642753 we got a good jump on it right now because we were able to get so much of the steel and precast erected
6642754 i fully expect well be having lights on at night
6642755 we dont think its going to be a substantial or significant impact fans will have to make some adjustments but we dont think its going to dramatically affect traffic flows
6642756 the continued development of the north shore is a positive for the city but we can expect to deal with some traffic issues due to construction during the process
6642757 we continue to recommend that people take advantage of the many downtown parking options available to them and we will regularly update our fans on the best possible alternative routes to take on steelers game days and for heinz field events
6642758 we make money with our people not on our people
6642759 this delightful little blond haired lady taught these guys who were a bunch of bozos to look like professional dancers
6642760 i was blown away by the choreography i was amazed that she was able to get non dancers and make them look so balletic and precise
6642761 i told her i would love for her to work for me
6642762 she always had this joyful spirit always saying something nice about the next person
6642763 she hugged all of her students at the end of her class it was a ritual they curtsied and then she would embrace them
6642764 we have a better idea of how to evaluate this year opposed to last season and i didnt realize how thin we were last year
6642765 weve worked on getting our depth up and have a better idea on plugging some of those holes
6642766 he is going to get his fair share of carries and will still return kickoffs for us
6642767 last year he got the record here at alvin when he returned a kickoff 94 yards against pearland ashton has a lot of people looking at him plenty of schools will wait after that first game to see where they stand with him but there has been a lot of traffic on him and one thing he has done is improve his speed
6642768 last year he was able to be a back up at quarterback and also played receiver and defensive back he was also a deep snapper so he got a lot of his experience on the special teams but he is not your typical junior because he is a leader and very smart with the football so we are hoping to do some good things with him
6642769 a couple of those guys are bryce hogue in the secondary who has looked very solid in the early going
6642770 a good linebacker that also is looking good is justin baum and an offensive lineman is jeffrey lewis weve come a long way since last year
6642771 i want to take care of that right now because these kids are focused and can get it done
6642772 camp to our supermax in the prince albert pen to the facility in quebec where the most violent persons are sent
6642773 given that derivatives markets have become a vital component of the financial system the bank believes that the expert panel should consider the regulation of these markets
6642774 rbc is committed to addressing the problem of retail clients who hold auction rate securities
6642775 we have expressed our willingness to work with regulators to develop and implement a program to provide liquidity to certain individual clients and small businesses and charities
6642776 it was frustrating when i was dusting myself off but really i was there
6642777 i learned a lot and experienced so much for my first olympics i will take that onto the next one
6642778 everybody is so cool i think a lot of people enjoyed it i think its the sport to watch in four years
6642779 this morning i didnt even have practice because i had a mechanical problem
6642780 my first lap on the track was my first time on the track this morning
6642781 i was nervous i got through it the second motto i was pissed off with everything that happened in the third motto it was just acceptance i just needed to go out there and race my best and whatever happens happens in the end i qualified
6642782 it wasnt the way i wanted to qualify but i did being in the final and falling you cant be too upset i learned so much this olympics really hasnt went my way but ive persevered and im confident for the next four years
6642783 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6642784 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6642785 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6642786 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6642787 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6642788 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6642789 hes not one of them he never was one of them
6642790 in my view hes never been accepted by the horsey set
6642791 he was absolutely suicidal we were so scared we were losing him
6642792 we want it known that we disagree strongly disagree with the selection we want the public the media and our sponsors to know weve done all we could to not accept him
6642793 i worked from the bottom up as a groom it was a lot of years of hard work thats where the tears on the medal podium come from
6642794 hes turned his life around and no one knows how
6642795 but the sports establishment came down so hard on him its great to sit in judgment
6642796 im so impressed with his character his strength and his discipline
6642797 he stops and says you know i really want to win for canada i want to win for my country erics a proud guy he was just driven by this
6642798 who showed me great support at a time when that was not so easy
6642799 i met rodney in the deep end of the pool today
6642800 two a days is a system that i believe is built to kind of break us down and then lift us back up
6642801 this is part of lifting us back up we just had a hard scrimmage yesterday we get a chance to relax lay in the lazy river for a little bit just recharge our batteries
6642802 its a good time to relax and get to know each other a little better
6642803 you dont have to think about football as much you dont have to work as hard remember plays any of that stuff
6642804 i thought we were worn out more mentally than physically
6642805 in the locker room we were talking about would we go some guys heard some rumors about going last week
6642806 i didnt want to get my hopes up just because then every day you get let down and you might be thinking about it in practice
6642807 this is the last two a day school starts on monday so i was pretty shocked
6642808 i think they thought i was being a bad guy this year
6642809 i heard the rumor that coach is mad so were not going to do it this year
6642810 it just takes the mind off football for a couple hours
6642811 some of these guys the rookies probably dont know we have to go back to work tomorrow
6642812 we the legislature are going to force you to wear motorcycle helmets because those motorcycle riders who do not risks having head injuries that would then be a drain on state resources used to care for those who are disabled because their actions adversely affect others and society as a whole we are going to prohibit them
6642813 we are not forcing you to take care of us we are willing to take the risk we value taking the risk and we are willing to accept the consequences if we end up with massive brain damage then dont take are of us
6642814 what inner man arrange as of now are your robbers arsonists and murderers simply himself threw your have title to football concours as thats un american
6642815 you gotta keep an axe in your waist at all times and its a whole lot of people thats just looking to side so dont worry about the haters you just bring it from withinside
6642816 if its blown up youll see that its good and multiplied good but its
6642817 it is not because they are muslims but it is because they have done criminal acts
6642818 justice for the pains he has done and justice for the people and i am willing for that to happen because it will open our hearts and minds i also accept the fact that he had done terroristic activities
6642819 with that bounty i hope that bravo and kato will be brought to justice

6642950 i get five months a year and only work four days a week so its pretty good for the band
6642951 we spend the winters writing dans parents have a place on the vineyard and we write music and hang out the winter tends to be really creative for us
6642952 i discovered bowie after i started my own foray into glittery boots
6642953 i dont study glam rock but it fits me very well naturally what i like to do is be flamboyant when im onstage
6642954 but we wanted to wait until we had a good idea of what we wanted it to be
6642955 i dont know how ive managed to do it but ive somehow dodged the place for the five years ive been in the big leagues
6642956 i havent been there since i was 16 and i was on the canadian junior national team and it was still skydome so its going to mean more to me being the only canadian team left it might be a little hectic at first with the media because i havent been there but im looking forward to it
6642957 when i was a kid growing up in the early 90s when the blue jays were winning back to back world series they were everyones team and we all followed them after a while no matter where you are baseball tends to just be baseball regardless of where you are but this one is going to be a little more meaningful
6642958 the patriotism that runs through that country is second to none so whether its baseball or whatever people just embrace that i think thats what makes canada canada and its not just athletes its everybody
6642959 trail has produced at least a dozen impact hockey players not just cup of coffee nhl guys
6642960 im a little different but the people there are still excited because it gives them something to follow outside of the winter season weve had a lot of success with our athletes theyre very patriotic when it comes to canadians but even more proud when it comes to the locals
6642961 theyve got a great bullpen great starters and every time weve played them it has not been fun
6642962 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting
6642963 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
6642964 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
6642965 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
6642966 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
6642967 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
6642968 the response rate is 10 and we do not calculate refusal rates for zogby interactive polls
6642969 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
6642970 as far as i know we dont publish response and refusal rates we conducted the poll for the associated press youd have to ask them about releasing the response and refusal rates
6642971 we dont have them here from ipsos it takes a little while for them to get those to us i can ask them it shouldnt take too long but normally it takes a few days theyre not secret or anything
6642972 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
6642973 the response rate for the poll was 31 over a three day field period because of the unique method of collecting data for this poll the response rate is not comparable to those of telephone based polls
6642974 as we collect data using our online panel there really is not a comparable metric to the refusal rates that telephone polls have
6642975 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
6642976 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
6642977 the latest reuters zogby poll has a cooperation rate of 16

6642979 then i went to grab it and there was nothing its kind of the way its been happening to me this olympics
6642980 hes a humble guy but i know its my job to get the guy the baton and i didnt do that
6642981 if people want to assess the blame to me thats ok
6642982 i mean i can take whatever it is that people are going to dish out we had good chemistry the hand was back there she was there i dont know what happened
6642983 i probably went over the race a million times in my head
6642984 he really opened up his stride coming down the home stretch
6642985 i used to run that way back in high school before i started to get all technical so i came here and said im just going to open up and let it fly and thats how it played out
6642986 but i believed i could do it and that is the first step in winning
6642987 i have been looking for this moment for four years
6642988 i think some people put more emphasis on it than the others but its necessary for the team because its a good time for the team to jell together
6642989 really after the third one two more weeks and youre playing for real so we use it as a tempo setter jelling together and guys getting their conditioning together playing for longer amount of plays and a longer amount of the game so i think its very important
6642990 i think all of us we need to play well this week
6642991 we were disappointed last week and we need to answer against a real good football team in philly its a great opportunity and were looking forward to it
6642992 i think theyre all important league wide this is traditionally the one where you actually do some game planning and what not i think some people put more stock into it
6642993 but i think any time you hit the field you want to go play good football we need to tighten up on the little details when we do that things will be good
6642994 when youre not out there youre always going to get behind
6642995 but first and foremost the most important thing was getting healthy thats something i did and im ready to go but i was also able to talk to rodney we went over plays and stuff so i think that helped
6642996 its important for the rookies to bring themselves up to speed and to seek out help if they need help they have veterans here they have young guys fourth and fifth year players they can communicate with as well as the coaches
6642997 stats and myself if we see someone struggling well definitely help them out
6642998 dont worry this is how we do it youre going to love it
6642999 i guess they say you learn the hard way and today i learned the hard way
6643000 all i can say to everybody is thanks for your support ive put absolutely everything into this everything from the age of ten
6643001 but im an athlete ill come back stronger in london turn it round and show everybody im made of
6643002 this time round there have been some real ups and downs
6643003 i crashed in the time trial got back up got second then got first in the last semifinal im cut up and hurt its been a tough day
6643004 really though i couldnt have put any more into the racing than i have done this week

6643086 there are at least three major story lines at the convention and the clintons are the third
6643087 my suspicion is that a conflict oriented press corps will get bored with a celebratory convention forgetting that this is what conventions are meant to be
6643088 so we will look for conflict sizzle and the clintons would then elbow aside the vp choice for second place and we will have the equivalent of a britney spears watch
6643089 there is going to be maximum coverage of the clintons
6643090 the clintons have rock star status you have the near miss in the primaries and bill clinton is one of the most eloquent orators on the planet it all spells maximum coverage and news organizations are going to have to plan accordingly

6643105 with average americans facing economic dislocation barack obama led the charge himself at a campaign rally today in chester virginia where he claimed i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make five million dollars and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong theres no other way to look at obamas outburst and the lefts piling on than anything besides rank class warfare maybe this tack will play well in stoking latent working class resentments at inflation housing instability and rising unemployment maybe this meme will stick if the american electorate is undergoing a fundamental shift in ideological orienation toward the abandonment of free market competition and opportunity based upward mobility or perhaps obamas income envy will play with those who harbor genuine revolutionary inclinations and see the illinois senator as the vanguard of the proletariat more likely obamas attack on mccains residential non recollection reveals the candidates subterranean push to resurrect great society liberalism in america note that obamas quoted in the wall street journal today regarding his recent statements on health care reform if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system
6643106 prefer that the government focus on improving overall economic conditions and the jobs situation in the united states as opposed to taking steps to distribute wealth more evenly among americans

6643121 one of the worst disasters in our nations history hurricane katrina and its aftermath became one of the biggest disasters in bushs presidency
6643122 the perception of this catastrophe was made worse by previous decisions president bush had made including first and foremost the failure to be open and forthright on iraq and rushing to war with inadequate planning and preparation for its aftermath
6643123 it was all about manipulating sources of public opinion to the presidents advantage
6643124 no one including me can know with absolute certainty how the war will be viewed decades from now when we can more fully understand its impact
6643125 what i do know is that war should only be waged when necessary and the iraq war was not necessary

6643137 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment
6643138 all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago

6643250 there was an incident a few weeks ago when a lad was knocked unconscious on the street outside a pub in carlisle he looked in a bad way
6643251 there was a door supervisor trying to put him in the recovery position but his mate who was very drunk was kicking off because he wanted to look after him
6643252 it was five minutes before police arrived and were able to handcuff him
6643253 if wed had the handcuffs then we could have acted immediately to restrain him
6643254 im all in favour of the practice building up to date premises but not on clarks field
6643255 it is a valuable green space which is heavily used by sports people youngsters and dog walkers it would be ridiculous to think of building there when there is a much better site just a few hundred yards away
6643256 the belah school site has much better access and would be the ideal location for a new surgery in that part of the city
6643257 there are two possibilities one is to simply knock down the old school and built it on that piece of land the other is to build it on open land there and then to knock the school down to replace the green space i would much prefer to see a medical centre on that site rather then housing and i think its a way for the county council to give something back to the community
6643258 our priority is to find somewhere convenient for our patients with good access
6643259 discussions are taking place between ourselves potential developers and other interested parties but there are commercial sensitivities and no site has been earmarked
6643260 its going to be our main surgery but the other two practices are going to use it as a branch surgery for their patients in this area the other two practices will retain their main premises and use the proposed building as branch surgeries

6643320 back in the day we had some creative control over our own individual characters we were allowed to develop our own personalities and our own style and thats what made everybody unique and different it would be very hard for me for somebody to hand me a written script as to what they think my character might say no matter how good they may be or how talented they might be at what theyre doing i dont think i would have succeeded in that environment i just needed to know when i did an interview what were the bullet points then i would put on my thinking cap and try to think of a new approach something to make my interview different from everybody elses and different from my last interview
6643321 the little small fiefdoms couldnt flourish anymore because everybody was seeing what everybody else was doing with cable television
6643322 part of the problem with world championship wrestling was you had non wrestling people who didnt understand the product trying to compete with a company that was headed by a third generation family in the wrestling business and understood the core product even though the wcw was beating them in the ratings the wwf was still remaining profitable with pay per view it was really a situation where they just gave wcw enough time to create their own demise and thats really what happened
6643323 its like a minor league baseball team you can have a beautiful park some outstanding players and a great product that youre putting on the field but the perception is that its still the minor leagues and the big show is over here and everybody is going to see the disparity between the two i dont think theres any way that the minor league team can elevate themselves to the place where theyre seen at the same level
6643324 the original horsemen will always be special to me because they were what started it all and it wasnt molded creatively it was an impromptu thing the fans really made it happen and it was because of the uniqueness of the talent but in terms of the in ring product and the capability of the type of matches about the third time through when barry windham was there was the best in ring product because barry had everything barry was young tall good looking had an amazing athleticism could really do anything in the ring and would have made a great world champion so thats my favorite group in terms of what could happen in the ring
6643325 you have to want me i have to keep you on your toes
6643326 we all want the business to do well not ourselves
6643327 they are there to enjoy the show and have a great time
6643328 that would be awesome i am big fans of both of them but right now everyone has to concentrate on watching the talent we have right now and the talent that has brought us to this point right now to want mick foley amp ric to come to us to sign
6643329 hey lets write a really smart texas hold em movie there hasnt been one since rounders

6643333 we live in a society of unbridled greed and the studios are a big part of that huge conglomerates control film studios which are only a small part of the corporate empire and the bottom line is central to their thinking
6643334 a unique engrossing and fulfilling experience its a narcotic anybody who does it once willingly never wants to stop
6643335 yeah but you know what if we remove this and remove this well actually make the floor bigger
6643336 if we take away this line and move it over here you can actually change the story and make something better

6643343 those who want to transact business with us are always very suspicious
6643344 the nigerian government frowns very seriously on these scams and every day tries to track down those who are involved

6643353 it became apparent to me as a capitalist that if i lent myself to this sort of action by his fellow businessmen and resisted any change designed to benefit all the people i could be consumed by the poisons of social lag i had helped to create
6643354 i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
6643355 see in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in to kind of catapult the propaganda
6643356 america was never innocent we popped our cherry on the boat over and looked back with no regrets you cant ascribe our fall from grace to any single event or set of circumstances you cant lose what you lacked at conception
6643357 mass market nostalgia gets you hopped up for a past that never existed hagiography sanctifies shuck and jive politicians and reinvents their expedient gestures as moments of great moral weight our continuing narrative line is blurred past truth and hindsight only a reckless verisimilitude can set that line straight

6643374 you dont want to lose on your gold medal day
6643375 eight years for possible reinstatement of the sport doesnt make any difference
6643376 this is our game and we wanted to win it
6643377 we shouldnt regard this as some kind of formal investigation but we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into some discrepancies in this case
6643378 the information that i have received in may also came from the international federation and the chinese olympic committee which provided the necessary information and evidence
6643379 the eligibility of the athletes has already been investigated and cleared by the international federation and if they had not been cleared they would not have participated in the games

6643389 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6643390 he was a tough negotiator but always reasonable and respectful with the ultimate goal of growing the game
6643391 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6643392 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6643393 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document

6643421 i had all sorts of scenarios in my mind for this weekend i imagined being on the boat i imagined strolling through annapolis i was hankering for a maryland crab cake i wondered whether we would see your friends so i could say good bye i imagined sunsets and sunrises i hoped we could go for a walk but never in my wildest imagination did i ever think we would not make love one last time never and i resent that i was not included in on that decision
6643422 it wasnt an expectation it was a hope a desire a vision
6643423 there is no compromise in this decision i didnt think it required a discussion
6643424 i understand that there is no compromise between 0 and 1 but i sure would have liked to have been included in on the discussion i would have liked to have thought my opinion mattered

6643430 the narrow local kind of mythic explanation that sufficed when cultures rarely mixed will never work in the emerging global culture we now need myths that are not only scientifically believable but allow us to participate all of us to experience the human meaning of modern scientific cosmology and to turn it into a working cosmology a meaningful universe in which we feel like participants our culture will gradually have to transform it into myth however mythmaking is no longer a purely imaginative spiritual endeavor today the leeway for speculation about the nature of time space and matter has narrowed now that we have data whole classes of possibilities have been ruled out and science is closing in on the class of myths that could actually be true

6643459 talking to real people is one of my strong suits and hopefully this gives me a chance to get out its frustrating sometimes to be behind the desk all the time and not interacting with people and talking to them making people comfortable and guiding the interview and being a good listener
6643460 this will be an opportunity to do some of that
6643461 unfortunately that end of the house was already well alight

6643481 there was not permanent damage to the aircraft and no injury to passengers
6643482 because there was only damage to the left hand wheels it would be incorrect to say that the aircraft totally left the runway there was nothing wrong with the right hand wheels

6643498 but here is the thing even when you care about people and enjoy their company sometimes too much time with no break turns fun into torture for me two days was the breaking point
6643499 i know that i am hard to talk to i am sure you wonder if you have said the right thing or the wrong thing or if saying nothing at all was the best choice
6643500 but i cant help but feel angry there i go talking about my emotions again and it has been really hard for me these past several weeks to get through the anger and the resentment and get to the place in my heart where the love lives

6643547 this decision was based on a thorough review of the information currently available and the immediate nature of the potential hazards associated with operations at those particular sites
6643548 and is consistent with tssas full commitment to protecting public safety in the province of ontario
6643549 this is a win win proposal for unitholders to unlock value now compared to the price the market has been prepared to trade their units
6643550 at the same time it allows unitholders to maintain exposure to the core investment strategy of the fund
6643551 the board believes that it is in the best interests of all unitholders to de list the fund from the asx and to introduce a series of redemption facilities to provide unit holders in the fund with liquidity should they desire it once the fund is de listed
6643552 we are confident that the proposal provides a value enhancing solution for our unitholders
6643553 it balances the interests of unitholders who wish to redeem from the fund in the short term while preserving the integrity of the underlying investment strategy for unit holders who have invested for the long term
6643554 its unusual to be asked what we are going to do ahead of a rate cut but on what we know today this is a pretty simple equation anz boss mike smith said today
6643555 if funding costs continue at the current levels and the reserve bank do actually cut rates then there will be a full flow on to our mortgage customers
6643556 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down he said
6643557 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision
6643558 despite drilling numerous holes in it and trying to blast it the workers havent been able to move or break the boulder
6643559 officer officer you got the wrong man no no im a student of medicine a son of a banker you dont understand
6643560 no one got hurt you should be thankful and your carelessness it is something awful to shame
6643561 until either a lot of supply comes on stream or the economy collapses the bull market will continue
6643562 theres nobody who earns in my family while ill have to pay taxes electricity bill and buy other necessities
6643563 we have to make ara and sell it so that the maize is not spoilt
6643564 theres no designated marketing centre for the farmers to sell their maize products like for kharang and sip
6643565 we sell ara and buy rice which is tastier and cheaper
6643566 that may be possible for people near the road but i cant bring my tengma and wait a whole day by the road
6643567 we sell ara whenever we need to buy some essentials
6643568 ara is like medicine for farmers like us especially after a hard days work
6643569 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6643570 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6643571 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6643572 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6643574 two high level lehman brothers executives will be leaving the beleaguered investment bank

6643576 a metal that is dug out of the ground at great cost to be reinterred in bank vaults as a protection against the same stupidity as caused it to be dug up in the first place
6643577 what is now seen as a predominantly younger pastime will spread to encompass a wider group of people in part due to the aging of current online video viewers but also as a result of word of mouth spread of services growth of in home networks and new network connected consumer electronic devices
6643578 lois he can see you through the window you know
6643579 maybe but i dont want to walk up to a random farmer in a field thinking hes my cousin and find out hes not especially not here cause the person might actually know me
6643580 i dont care if i do something to embarrass myself no one out here knows me anyway and ill never see them again
6643581 jinhe naaz hai hind par woh kahan they jinhe naaz hai woh kahan hai
6643582 do we have answer i dont know about a lot of things and i dont know how to weave beautiful stories and poetic text but i know one thing for sure next time there is someone who challenges my india i would be there and i would stand tall and be counted
6643583 plan tr s haut d bit pour tous les fran ais
6643584 tell me how to set that up and i would be there in a heartbeat
6643585 it wasnt at all the same drama as in 2004 it feels so much more sane
6643586 they are senior advocates and did not tender either conditional or unconditional apology for their conduct in the case
6643587 on the basis of the material before us we find that anand was a key player in interfering or at least tending to interfere in the due course of a judicial proceeding and obstructing the administration of justice in any other manner we are also left with no doubt in our mind that the unshakeable truth is that anand is guilty of criminal contempt of court
6643588 anand and khan are seasoned lawyers of this court with decades of practice behind them anand has held prestigious elective positions in the legal fraternity and he has also been a member of parliament in the rajya sabha
6643589 khan is known for his legal acumen and forensic skills and that is perhaps the reason why he was appointed as special public prosecutor in the bmw case that he would betray the trust that the prosecution reposed in him in the manner that he did was perhaps beyond the realm of contemplation of the prosecuting agency
6643590 we are not dealing with a young lawyer who driven by ambition and desire to make his career and in his over zealousness transgresses the limits by crossing the laxman rekha both are seasoned lawyers and such conduct was not expected of them
6643591 i cannot comment of the decision given by the high court it is not the jurisdiction of the high court to debar or cancel the licence of a lawyer only the bar council of india can take a decision in the matter
6643592 the matter the lawyers trying to bribe the key witness is pending before the bar council and it will give a decision in the next hearing
6643593 a constitutional bench of the supreme court has given the power to debar or cancel the licence of a lawyer to the bar council of india but what is peculiar is that so much time has passed but the bar has not taken any decision in this regard
6643594 moreover the punishment of debarring the lawyers from practice for four months and a fine of rs 2 000 is highly inadequate the reputation of the lawyers has taken a beating after the expose and stringent punishment is called for the guilty
6643595 those who saw the movie told the authorities they were shocked to find that bachchan played the role of god
6643596 such films should not be released anywhere in the world because they are not only against islamic teachings but are against the teachings of all heavenly religions
6643597 oprah has told the editors at o magazine she s tired of being on the cover every month
6643598 it s a pain it takes a lot of time and energy and she s sick of it she s given them six months to figure out what to do without her
6643599 oprah winfrey has appeared on the cover of o since its launch in 2000 and she will continue to do so
6643600 in fact shoots for three upcoming covers will take place in early september
6643601 as far as conviction of casting me all the credit goes to him ram gopal verma i had no idea what he had in his mind due to lot of intensity in the character he casted me and probably wanted me to make the character look real and not very star cast type he has gone on with casting because i guess because he wanted people to just get into the flow of the subject and not the casting
6643602 my character in the film is about a girl who is a complete believer in god somewhere down the line she starts believing in black magic she thinks that as god is power so is black magic which takes one towards the evil but slowly as the film progresses she thinks that practical things like doctors and medicine also exist so my character transforms from a complete believer in god towards an atheist
6643603 actually i was excited and i wanted to do this movie because i had to touch the roof and somebody who was to slap me was not visible
6643604 its strange to be following in the footsteps of angelina jolie shes amazing and if i can be anywhere near as good as her ill be happy
6643605 this is my perfect job i have always wanted to be an action hero and hope to be able to use my gymnastic ability to perform all of laras stunts it is slightly daunting but i am really excited at the same time
6643606 i went into a room and performed all my stuff such as somersaults back flips rolls all the things lara can do in the game i got a recall and performed all my stuff again this time in costume and i got the job
6643607 i would love to meet them but especially angelina shes brilliant and has always been a role model of mine i love her acting she is so very talented and beautiful before i even auditioned i watched the films over and over and played the video game to make sure i understood the character perfectly
6643608 i had to dive for cover when one guy who we didn
6643609 im almost done with eod school and you just started haha
6643610 oh yeah well i graduated in 78 so actually you suck
6643611 hes not going to change youre going to have to accept that and figure out how to deal with it
6643612 its hard for me to realize what just happened said villa who began playing as a child in the los angeles suburb of commerce
6643613 i didnt want to be in that spot today but holland just outplayed us thats just the way sport is
6643614 i had no clue where the goalie was she said
6643615 i saw her face and i knew it was good dutch coach robin van galen said of de bruijns demeanor before the game
6643616 but i didnt know she can play so enormous especially in this game
6643617 it was either that or give up a goal villa said u s coach guy baker told his players during a timeout to keep the ball from de bruijn but the dutch worked it around until they found their star she got the ball at the top and powered it past u s goalie betsey armstrong
6643618 you want to be in these tough moments and play for the gold medal petri said
6643619 it was a great run for us but sometimes they dont have happy endings golda said
6643620 the technology is moving a lot quicker than some people would expect
6643621 we produce oils on the fuel side so that can go straight into the refining structure
6643622 the problem in india is that students get only degrees and no skills

6643635 i thought i mixed up pretty well tonight and was really solid not giving her many free points and making her work for every point
6643636 i guess i need to get used to being back again in these kinds of situations but after losing that game i really regrouped really well played a good service game and then put a lot of pressure on her service game i tried to learn from a couple of games ago and do much better next time
6643637 she was serving well i think and she has a great slice which i couldnt really handle
6643638 i was missing a lot and couldnt move really well she was good today
6643639 it was too hot in the beginning of the second set i felt a little dizzy but then i was fighting until the end thats why i won
6643640 its good because i won the match without playing my best level
6643641 i dont think i could have asked for a better week before the u s open
6643642 in the second set i just fought one point at a time everything was going my way
6643643 she doesnt give you any points especially on hardcourts she just played better than me today
6643644 i want to dedicate my victory today to all the victims and all the families of the victims in the flight in madrid yesterday and send them all of my support and everything of me that i can help for them
6643645 it is my hometown and when this thing happened i felt so bad yesterday and today

6643649 i decided to get into martial arts when i was a baby
6643650 my dad was doing it and i liked it when i did it i felt really good
6643651 by the time she was 3 she was doing splits and kicks and she did a demonstration people just went wild over it
6643652 was 6 feet tall and she wasnt hardly 3 feet tall
6643653 we even get to go out and see everything she sees
6643654 i hope she wins it no matter what well all benefit from it she does really good at it and yeah she could definitely whoop me but i dont want her to
6643655 i love my sissy and i hope she wins it
6643656 theres a lot of talents and i like to see talent
6643657 she wants to show kids they can study martial arts and have fun and also learn self defense and get into shape
6643658 she wanted to raise child safety awareness shes real soft hearted and real shy seeming until you see her compete she just decided she wanted to help get the word out
6643659 as soon as she saw the show last year she said thats what she wanted to do
6643660 i just went and looked everything up on the internet and started filling out papers
6643661 and were hoping we can get the support of the local area
6643662 just been fantastic ever since its gotten better and better
6643663 i was a little nervous but i believed that i could do it and i was ready i went and put everything i could into it
6643664 simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
6643665 i dont believe that an elected official should serve on county authorities that was the basis for my no vote the other two members of the personnel committee expressed similar concerns so i guess if you bang your head up against the wall long enough cracks start
6643666 anytime theres taxpayer dollars involved we should have representation whether its us or from the executive branch

6643669 me he esforzado mucho para conseguirlo y el mensaje que me gustar a transmitir a los j venes es que con dedicaci n y tes n es posible alcanzar cualquier cosa que uno se proponga
6643670 tambi n por los ni os porque creo que es importante que conozcan sus ra ces tiene tres
6643671 es bueno que la gente salga a otros pa ses y que conozcan otras culturas enriquece mucho
6643672 siempre que los tr mites se cumplan y est todo dentro de la legalidad
6643673 you cheated two vulnerable people of the large part of the real value of an elderly mans home
6643674 words cannot adequately describe the impact of your conduct on the lives of innocent people
6643675 duvido que todos esses que brandam pagar seus impostos para novas notas se revoltem com o fato de o pai
6643676 en mi casa siemprese ha vivido el mundo del toreo mi padre y mi abuelo fueron banderilleros y los abuelos de mi padre tambi n vamos yo soy el quinto fandila que se dedica al toreo as que desde peque ito siempre he estado jugando al toro ahora el toreo es mi forma de vida y a lo que le debo todo lo que tengo
6643677 desde luego el torero es una persona que nace y se hace porque tienes que nacer con algo dentro la ilusi n las ganas pero luego te vas depurando mucho adem s los toreros sin tener que ser personas muy distintas a las dem s s es cierto que por ejemplo aunque seamos j venes maduramos muy r pido
6643678 el miedo es algoque siempre se tiene en muchos mbitos de la vida pero en el mundo del toro se palpa a n m s no s c mo explicarlo m s que el miedo al animal se tiene miedo a defraudar a no ser capaz de afrontar las adversidades pero es un miedo que eres capaz de superar y de darle la vuelta el valor es algo muy de cabeza por l gica no se har an cosas que se hacen en el toreo pero la mentalizaci n es muy grande y el valor sale de ah de la preparaci n despu s est la capacidad de cada uno de superar las dificultades y los miedos y hay quien tiene m s o menos valor
6643679 el triunfo es algomuy bonito es con lo que siempre se sue a con triunfar con disfrutar y con hacerte un sitio en una profesi n tan complicada y tan bonita como esta yo creo que la base del xito es conseguir metas sentirse feliz con lo que uno hace y conseguir que la gente que te rodea y que va a la plaza disfrute con algo que t sientes
6643680 lo mejor del toreoes disfrutar cuando uno cuaja un toro y se siente a gusto en la plaza cuando sientes que miles de personas disfrutan con lo que t haces llega un momento en que la satisfacci n personal que est s viviendo no se cambia ni se compara con nada
6643681 existe mucha rivalidad hoy en d a en el toreo y aunque te lleves bien y haya compa eros con los que tienes una relaci n fenomenal y con los que comentas y hablas cuando sale el toro lo que tratas es de solucionar tu tarde y de forjarte un futuro y es una situaci n que tienes que defender t cuando sale el toro de cada uno aqu nos olvidamos de los amigos y eso es bueno y bonito es positivo que un torero se crezca viendo a otro y que cada uno en su forma sin imitar a nadie haga su toreo y la gente pueda ver dentro de diferentes conceptos toreros con ilusi n y con ganas de abrirse paso
6643682 cada persona es unmundo pero para m el d a que toreo los peores momentos los vivo cuando ya te han terminado de vestir llegas a la plaza y est s esperando antes de hacer el pase llo ah te rodea mucha gente y todo el mundo quiere hablarte y estar a tu lado pero para m es de los momentos m s delicados despu s cuando haces el pase llo parece que rompe un poco la tarde y se rompen muchas tensiones
6643683 los toreros somos personasque estamos siempre rodeados de mucha gente de mucho bullicio en los hoteles todo el mundo corriendo con prisas la plaza sin duda hay momentos en los que necesitamos desaparecer del mundo irnos al campo y tener un poco de paz no s si de soledad pero s de tranquilidad en los momentos de soledad que vives por ejemplo en el hotel es distinto en esos momentos intentas poner la mente en otra cosa para que las horas te pasen m s amenas tambi n hay veces que toreas en sitios importantes y entonces piensas en lo que te gustar a que pasase en la plaza
6643684 cuando toreas no piensas en sufrir por nadie bastante mal se pasa delante del toro para empezar a sufrir antes de tiempo aunque s es cierto que lo pasas un poco mal por tu gente por los que te aprecian y quieren esta es una profesi n en la que te vas del hotel y no sabes c mo vas a volver no hay un gui n determinado todos los d as tiras una moneda al aire y t a lo mejor no lo piensas pero los que te quieren como mi madre por ejemplo s de hecho para ellos es la primera llamada cuando llego al hotel para mi novia y mi madre
6643685 no es lo mismo dar servicio a 10 000 personas que a 50 000 se produce un importante aumento en el n mero de visitantes al que tambi n hay que darle prestaciones que valen dinero y un ayuntamiento que posee presupuesto para 10 000 personas dif cilmente podr atender a 50 000 si no es con ayudas supramunicipales

6643690 even with an increase of more than 19 in wimax subscribers in the first quarter of 2008 operators are still waiting for the tipping point that will lead to acceleration of wimax adoption and deployments
6643691 the key factors mainly center on certification of mobile wimax equipment a reduction in cpe pricing and the emergence of a device ecosystem

6643693 campaign aides said the additional tax like the current one would apply only to wages and salaries and not to other forms of income such as investments
6643694 let me be clear if youre a family making less than 250 000 my plan will not raise your taxes not your income taxes not your payroll taxes not your capital gains taxes not any of your taxes
6643695 this is not how i expected this evening to turn out

6643700 the plane was rocking back and forth until i suspected it was going to fall
6643701 i saw people smoke explosions i think that is what woke me up because i had lost consciousness
6643702 i thought that if help did not arrive soon i would die
6643703 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6643704 most likely whatever the malfunction of the probe was it is probably not related to what happened
6643705 given that there have been some discrepancies regarding her age that have come to light we have asked the fig to look into this matter
6643706 it is because of these discrepancies that we have asked for this investigation to start
6643707 can such a belligerent state be trusted as the guarantor of europes energy supply

6643717 beautiful corner office of this ancient stone facaded building with wine sitting on the table
6643718 we were sitting in the courtyard of chateau montelena watching a movie with scenes where trucks drive up to where youre sitting
6643719 thats the privilege of doing movies you get to drop into somebodys world i had to do it very fast my avenue in was more about the agriculture i found it fascinating
6643720 i have a ranch in montana with my brother and were raising hay in this very crude version of all that anybody whos involved with agriculture i think it takes a lot of humility and everything to make it all work they do it at such a refined level its fascinating
6643721 its amazing just the gentleness of the hills that nestle the valleys where the wineries are and the vineyards that roundly kind of lift away and up and down in these symmetrical configurations its a very very lucky corner of the world
6643722 nine years ago i thought to myself i dont really enjoy practicing law and i started writing scripts if i dont do something now its never going to happen
6643723 its a story that needs to be told and it cuts across generations and its something our generation doesnt know and its a great underdog story
6643724 maybe 40 minutes into the discussion jim barrett told me this crazy story about the wine he thumped his hands on the table and pushed his chair back and said ill tell you your movie and then he started telling me this weird story
6643725 when i was first writing it sideways had not come out yet
6643726 i said to my dad who is pretty good at judging american tastes by the way im writing this movie about wine and he said ross ill tell you i know you are really interested in it but i just dont see it
6643727 i want to show that wine is not this big stuffy hoity toity thing its fun and it tastes good
6643728 this is me enjoying a rainbow cone in celebration of richards racial slur

6643741 now that the berger commission is gone were essentially at a new square one where health care costs are high we still have a lot of problems and the question is what is an effective strategy going forward
6643742 timeliness is the overarching concern projects can take years to get through before youre able to move forward and many times these are not massive construction projects
6643743 were not looking for more trains to run just for the trains to run on time
6643744 our members have told us that they build in approximately a 10 increase in cost to a project merely because of the fact that project costs will go up that much during the time that they have to go through the certificate of need process

6643766 distinction between the two forms of contempt lies in the intended effect of the punishment imposed the purpose of civil contempt is coercive or compensatory whereas the purpose of criminal contempt is punitive
6643767 the attorneys fees lost royalties and storage costs were assessed in order to compensate the plaintiff for losses sustained furthermore the per diem fine was not to be assessed until fourteen days after the entry of the order and the defendants could avoid paying the fine by complying with the terms of the injunction because the per diem fine allowed the defendants the opportunity to purge the contempt before payment became due it was a civil sanction
6643768 holding that a civil sanction is directly appealable if it is immediately payable risks eviscerating the fundamental rule that compensatory sanctions are civil and not appealable on interlocutory review further we note that defendants will have the opportunity to appeal the sanctions imposed after a final judgment in sum we are not persuaded that the defendants face irreparable harm and in any event find that because of the defendants conduct any risk of harm is appropriately placed upon them
6643769 sesiapa berpuasa pada bulan ramadhan dalam keadaan beriman dan kerana menuntutkan keredhaan allah s w t nescaya diampunkan dosa dosanya yang telah lalu
6643770 setiap amanalan anak adam manusia itu digandakan satu kebaikan dengan sepuluh yang seumpamanya hingga kepada 700 kali ganda firman allah s w t maksudnya
6643771 sesiapa berpuasa ramadhan kemudian diiringi dengan puasa sunnat enam hari dalam bulan syawal adalah seperti puasa selama setahun
6643772 ia menghapuskan dosa setahun yang lalu dan tahun tahun kemudiannya
6643773 puasa pada hari arafah itu menghapuskan dosa dua tahun yang lalu dan tahun yang akan datanag
6643774 seafdal afdal puasa selepas ramadhan ialah puasa pada bulan allah iaitu bulan muharram dan seafdal afdal solat selepas solat fardhu ialah solat malam
6643775 sesiapa berpuasa pada hari arafah nescaya terhapus dosanya dua tahun dan sesiapa berpuasa satu hari daripada bulan muharram maka untuknya setiap sehari mendapat pahala 30 hari
6643776 sesungguhnya jika aku hidup pada tahun hadapan aku akan berpuasa pada 9 muharra
6643777 berpuasalah pada hari asyura 10 muharram dan jangalah menyamai perbuatan orang yahudi oleh itu berpuasalah sehari sebelum dan sehari sesudahnya
6643778 wahai rasullullah tidak saya lihat tuan hamba berpuasa satu bulan daripada bulan bulan dalam setahun selain ramadhan seperti tuan berpuasa pada bulan syaaban
6643779 bulan ini yakni bulan syaaban ialah bulan yang manusia lalai padanya antara rajab dan ramadhan pada hal ia yakni bulan syaaban adalah bulan diangkat amalan kepada tuhan seru sekelian alam maka aku suka amalanku diangkat dan aku berpuasa
6643780 tidak pernah aku lihat rasullullah s a w berpuasa dua bulan berturut turut melainkan pada bulan syaaban dan ramadhan
6643781 diperlihatkan kehadrat allah s w t segala amalan itu pada hari isnin dan khamis justeru saya suka ketika diperlihatkan amalan amalanku itu sedang aku berpuasa
6643782 sesiapa berpuasa pada hari rabu khamis dan jumaat kemudian bersedekah pada hari jumaat sedikit atau banyak nescaya diampunkan semua dosanya hingga menjadi seperti bayi yang baru dilahirkan oleh ibunya bersih daripada segala dosa
6643783 berpuasa tiga hari pada setiap bulan adalah puasa sepanjang tahun iaitu puasa pada hari hari putih pada hari 13 14 dan 15 bulan qamariyah
6643784 puasa tiga hari pada setiap bulan ramadhan ke ramadhan itulah puasa sepanjang masa
6643785 telah sampai berita kepadaku bahawa anda berpuasa pada waktu siang dan berjaga kerana beribadah waktu malam jangan buat demikian kerana untuk jasadmu atas dirimu ada habuan untuk matamu atas dirimu ada habuan dan untuk isterimu ada habuan puasalah dan berbukalah puasa tiga hari pada setiap bulan maka dengan demikian anda mendapat pahala sepanjang tahun
6643786 maka berpuasalah puasa nabidaud a s iaitu berpuasalah sehari dan berbuka sehari
6643787 puasa yang paling disukai oleh allah s w t ialah puasa nabi daud dan solat yang paling disukai allah s w t ialah solat nabi daud baginda tidur separuh malam dan bangun beribadah sepertiga malam dan tidur seperempat malam dan baginda berpuasa sehari dan berbuka sehari

6643789 in terms of whether anyone was criminally negligent the district attorney is looking at that
6643790 we dont do investigations of the conduct of our fire department or any other agency during that period at the request of the district attorney
6643791 if other agencies who had inspectional authority had done the inspections
6643792 if the contractor who had inspectional authority had done the inspections we would have fought that fire in a very different way and we would not have run into some of these extremely difficult situations such as no water and blocked stairwells

6643933 weve been practicing a long time and certainly today is the day we see how weve been doing i guess
6643934 well you dont have much to go off of neither teams played a game
6643935 weve just got to go with what we saw last year and prepare for a little bit of everything weve been practicing trying to get ourselves where we need to get our stuff and then well have to adjust and adapt to whatever they do at game time
6643936 we had opportunities to score a whole lot more points and we didnt
6643937 we feel like we have the ability to score with our run game or our pass game we just cant turn the ball over thats been a big emphasis for us
6643938 so were hoping to get a big crowd there and get the electricity going and have a good homefield advantage
6643939 the last week of practice last season was basically trying to do things to beat harrisonburg
6643940 and here we open up again with harrisonburg so its kind of like it just kind of continued on from last season thats been a little bit different but i think its helped the kids a little bit as far as knowing what to do

6643942 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind 38 this is the great and first commandment 39 and a second is like it you shall love your neighbor as yourself 40 on these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets
6643943 this commandment we have from him that he who loves god should love his brother also
6643944 if anyone says i love god but hates his brother he is a liar
6643945 the more perfect is it in that which it loves therefore this soul that is now perfect is wholly love if it may thus be expressed and all its actions are love and it employs all its faculties and possessions in loving giving all that it has like the wise merchant for this treasure of love which it has found hidden in god for even as the bee extracts from all plants the honey that is in them and has no use for them for aught else save for that purpose even so the soul with great facility extracts the sweetness of love that is in all the things that pass through it it loves god in each of them whether pleasant or unpleasant and being as it is informed and protected by love it has neither feeling nor taste nor knowledge of such things for as we have said the soul knows naught but love and its pleasure in all things and occupations is ever as we have said the delight of the love of god

6643967 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but from the preponderance of the many she did not make
6643968 her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
6643969 on the one hand this and on the other hand that
6643970 i can surprise you sometimes as i got one in whom you did not expect and there still might be one more player coming in
6643971 you know the position but i cannot tell you much more
6643972 there is interest in gareth barry but i cannot say much more
6643973 once someone plays in europe it devalues a player for the season but it doesnt necessarily mean you dont buy him
6643974 barry is a good player but the problem with players who are 27 or 28 is that you pay big money and then you get nothing back
6643975 i felt manchester united had made up their mind to let him go before we were interested to maybe manchester city or to france so it was not necessarily us going in there and buying a player
6643976 sometimes you need a player in the squad with the qualities you think will help
6643977 silvestre can play left back and centre back its an area where we had no experience

6643999 robinho never said that he wasnt comfortable at real madrid but the thing is that he has a financial offer that is very interesting its only that
6644000 so i have to say that until 31st august everything is possible until the transfer window is closed i cant say where robinho will play this season the president ramon calderon said to robinho that if a 40 million euros offer appears he would let him leave
6644001 milan had wanted to take the player on loan with the right to buy him but chelsea said no because they wanted us to buy him outright

6644023 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6644024 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6644025 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6644026 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6644027 the correct answer is at least four located in arizona california and virginia according to his staff
6644028 days after he cracked that being rich in the u s meant earning at least 5 million a year republican presidential candidate john mccain acknowledged that he wasnt sure how many houses he and his wealthy wife actually own
6644029 a lot of you out there are struggling just to make ends meet just to put food on the table and to put your kids through school you know how many houses you own but john mccain has so many he cant remember
6644030 who do you think is going to do a better job for you in the white house
6644031 forget the how many homes mccain has jamie and go out to colorado and play some golf
6644032 this delightful little blond haired lady taught these guys who were a bunch of bozos to look like professional dancers
6644033 i was blown away by the choreography i was amazed that she was able to get non dancers and make them look so balletic and precise
6644034 i told her i would love for her to work for me
6644035 she always had this joyful spirit always saying something nice about the next person
6644036 she hugged all of her students at the end of her class it was a ritual they curtsied and then she would embrace them

6644038 he and i became really good friends we were there in the tough times in the good times too
6644039 he is really going to be missed in the nfl and by football generally
6644040 obviously life moves on but i dont know that anybody can replace gene upshaw
6644041 the games the most important thing and thats what youre trying to protect
6644042 he saw that and i saw that with him we just started that and as you do with friendship youre with people for a time when i had my 50th wedding anniversary he and his wife terry came we had that kind of relationship
6644043 he came to my fathers and my mothers funerals we were pretty close
6644044 i played against him when i was with the houston oilers and he was with the raiders he was a great player his leadership will be missed by all in the nfl
6644045 i think overall for the players you can throw darts at gene all over the board but he did far more than anybody who ever started in this business free agency and where the system is is far better than any player ever imagined
6644046 the strategy talks about full cost recovery for organisations providing agreed homeless services however this year the government has cut back on funding for homeless services and has failed to meet the increased costs of vital services ultimately putting them at risk
6644047 we have raised our concerns they have not been recognised and now we feel like there is an even more difficult task ahead if we are to realistically tackle the problem
6644048 with the value of hindsight our 42m capital raising late last year was well timed and this coupled with strong trading profits and cash flows provides ebos with an excellent base from which to continue to pursue new growth opportunities
6644049 we expect our regular trading markets to remain competitive with some softness in the retail environment
6644050 and i do know what real love is i dooo because dis one guy right he fort i was messin around wiv his mate and i wasnt but he fort i was so he got really angry and when i wasnt lookin he dun a shit in my pencil case and for him to do something dat needs all dat planning and accuracy he mustve been really in love so i do know what im doing

6644052 carolina is consistently recognized among the five best public universities in america
6644053 we find value in assessing the various measures that determine such rankings in the case of u s news we are most interested in results from areas including faculty resources and student success our focus is on retaining and attracting excellent faculty who are the key to recruiting the very best students from north carolina and beyond to chapel hill

6644056 some 85 per cent of residents in nsw do not want our energy generators and retailers to be sold off
6644057 we say that he should listen to the public put the sell off to the public let democracy prevail
6644058 the socialist alliance supports the power industry workers who know that some of their work mates will be out of a job if this sale goes ahead we also support their calls for action if anyone is sacked or if the energy bills go through with the support liberal national and shooters
6644059 like many others we dont think that a sale will help shift energy production away from its main power base polluting coal towards the sustainable energy sector to do this requires a political commitment to finding real and lasting solutions to the climate crisis something that this government doesnt have
6644060 in the context of global petrol and oil price rises the food crisis and climate change the socialist alliance is keen to raise political and ecological alternatives to the business as usual agenda of the major parties
6644061 council elections provide an opportunity to talk about the real social and ecological changes that are urgently needed for the common good
6644062 we are going to highlight our opposition to the nsw governments sell off of the energy sector during this campaign
6644063 we believe that the local development ecological transport and housing conundrums in marrickville reflect something rotten in a system that puts profits before peoples needs
6644064 investing in public transport an east west link needs assessment
6644065 hillcrest staff did not respond appropriately to repeated complaints of pain
6644066 senior hse staff met with and unreservedly apologised to the family for the distress and upset that this incident had caused and acknowledged that the incident fell well below best practice in the care of older people

6644075 its unacceptable what shell is being allowed to get away with here in mayo we intend to plunder shells compound at glengad and board the solitaire when she arrives in the bay
6644076 we are very concerned about what took place today in terms of the safety issues and are urging all people not to engage in this type of activity again we have had two years of protests here and everyone is entitled to protest
6644077 it was a trap and he fell for it he was given the deportation papers as soon as he touched down
6644078 that meant they could legally make him get on that plane back to the uk or put him in a detention centre
6644079 in framing my proposal for a unified curriculum i have asked myself how does a scholars mind work
6644080 sometimes youre anxious when you go up there and you want to get the job done right away
6644081 but you cant be afraid to go deep into counts and work it
6644082 it was fun seeing his hair go all the way back
6644083 he volunteered it to me when we were putting him on the dl
6644084 he realized what time of the year we were in
6644085 great things are not done by impulse but by a series of small things brought together
6644086 great things are not done by impulse but by a series of small things brought together
6644087 i have nothing to hide i didnt do anything wrong ive brought this here for you to see
6644088 they should not have been using it equi block they should know that they shouldnt use it they should have known that capsaicin is an ingredient in equi block and that its also a grade a listed substance banned for use at any stage
6644089 this is our third high profile case in terms of banned substances turning up in horses after cian oconnor and in some cases i have great sympathy for the rider but its very damaging for irish equestrian sport
6644090 denis took it out of his tack box and showed it to me he uses it to loosen muscles in the lower back of the horse and he has used it since he got lantinus for the entire year
6644091 this was a big surprise today denis was so certain that it was not a problem that he didnt draw it to my attention thats not unreasonable because he has been using it for a long time and there have been no positive test results for this substance up until these olympic games
6644092 i begged them to let me ride i didnt go looking for a fancy lawyer or high powered pr people i just wanted to come here to explain
6644093 let me say that although this is a bitter pill to swallow we have three boxers still fighting
6644094 we knew we were going to be in the spotlight if it wasnt cheating it was incredible stupidity
6644095 privatisation is in the best interests of nsw and both the premier and the leader of the opposition to date have demonstrated real leadership in a non partisan manner i have every confidence that the two leadership groups can develop the right framework for privatisation to fail on this issue would be a disaster for nsw
6644096 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
6644097 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
6644098 residents can attend council meetings but if we want to speak we you have to give notice the day before in writing and then only for three minutes this really isnt democracy
6644099 there has to be mechanism for residents to be a lot more involved in councils decision making because the issues being decided on by council have an affect on our lives
6644100 roads footpaths cycle paths waste recycling and school out of schools hours care are all important issues but council should more reflect the communitys concerns about housing affordability the state alp governments proposed controversial energy sell off and a massively expanded public transport system to the state government
6644101 my union experience shows that democracy is essential to achieving any real and long lasting change the your rights at work campaign against
6644102 democracy means participation thats the only guarantee we have of having a say in the decisions that affect our lives and that of the community if elected socialist alliance will push for much greater openness and democracy in council
6644103 if we can demonstrate that we have our arms around the infrastructure our arms around how we manage growth i think we can grow we can achieve all the dreams this region has for itself

6644108 he was admitted there following an episode of back and chest pain this morning
6644109 his condition is stable and his medical investigations are ongoing liam will remain under observation overnight in beaumont hospital we all wish liam a full and speedy recovery
6644110 we know hes been taken into the heart unit but its nothing like a heart attack we understand that its not life threatening its not serious theyre just keeping him in for tests
6644111 he was in great form and took a full part in the match
6644112 i saw him in the second half pacing up and down in the dressing room he was normal
6644113 think hes good you should see the younger brother at home
6644114 hes exactly the same height as i am six foot three and a quarter the quarter is very important

6644118 causes annoyance or inconvenience in a world youth day event
6644119 faced with a peaceful july 19 protest against pope benedicts mediaeval positions on issues like condom use the ministerial clique in macquarie street has introduced laws that would be laughable if they werent such a violation of civil liberties
6644120 the laws give police the right to ban propaganda and strip search people at hundreds of sites across the city including at bus stops and train stations checking to see if they are wearing an offensive t shirt
6644121 with their draconian regulations iemma and co have decided to prevent the possibility of a chaser style stunt against the pope by becoming a permanent chaser skit themselves
6644122 these rules were deliberately gazetted while the parliament wasnt sitting stifling debate and removing parliaments right to block them so lets all get those t shirts out that proclaim our support for womens rights same sex marriage and safe sex
6644123 and then let iemma and co try to apply their buffoonish laws against us
6644124 not content with pushing ahead with an electricity privatisation plan opposed by 80 of people in new south wales iemmas comedy team has now introduced regulations opposed by 89 of respondents to an online
6644125 it is also spending around 86 million to support world youth day whatever happened to the separation of church and state
6644126 just like the heavy handed police powers introduced in the lead up to apec last year to intimidate people out of protesting iemmas latest effort will have exactly the opposite effect to its intention
6644127 most rational people including many catholics are opposed to the dangerous and antiquated policies of the catholic hierarchy on condom use abortion and homophobia
6644128 this is not just a victory for the notopope coalition ntpc or just for the queer community or just for campaigners for reproductive rights this is a victory for all protesters
6644129 lets all make sure we are as annoying as we can possibly be
6644130 we have a role in the gay community we have a role in society it is to stand up and speak up with the truth about whats happened in the church and whats been covered up
6644131 the rules the pope has made are oppressive and unjust
6644132 it doesnt know the difference between men and women gay or lesbian white black or anything yet the vatican is playing russian roulette with our lives
6644133 we are protesting against the popes anti queer anti abortion anti condom stance
6644134 were frustrated by the taxpayer funded nature of wyd to the tune of 150 million

6644136 im surprised youre showing your face around here after sergeant rocksalt kicked your ass
6644137 showing my face this is my tent do you need something sergeant
6644138 aw well no sergeant im just saying that we all kind of knew he would kick your ass
6644139 sergeant zoloft get the fuck out of my tent or im going to choke you next
6644140 you know you really should be in the smoking area
6644141 hey top um i heard that the army tem miler is going to have a mirror run at camp victory this year im going to start training for it
6644142 you are the girl from the tv talk show with mart smeets arent you may i have your signature
6644143 the dutchies consistently throw the best party at the olympics
6644144 being just one enormous beer hall is just not true
6644145 the ioc told us we are the best house the best example
6644146 i mean we all know why hollands famous for its freedoms
6644147 they understand when we explain what we do were a business and were here to entertain investors were not a place for hospitality
6644148 at the olympics the u s plays well but the dutch have good parties
6644149 its just how the dutch are the space between people is much smaller
6644150 if i were in the u s youd think he was my boyfriend
6644151 it has failed to exploit the massive level of public support for strong action by the federal government to act quickly and decisively to combat climate change
6644152 instead it contains measures which protect industrial polluters by offering them free permits to pollute and excluding some industries from the scheme altogether
6644153 climate change minister penny wong says that she accepts that australia is not about to become a world leader in tackling climate change
6644154 if developed countries like australia which have very high levels of per capita ghgs do not take responsibility for taking the initiative to reduce their emission levels and which have been primarily responsible for creating the problem why would the developing countries like india and china agree to move to limit their emissions levels and fully participate in an international agreement
6644155 it must be made clear to the rudd government that protecting some sectors from the need to move to sustainable sources of energy as a matter of urgency will impose greater costs on everyone else and require much more severe costs on the whole community as the effects of climate change become ever more destructive by providing free or concessional permits to trade exposed industries and coal fired power generators and excluding industries such as agriculture from the scheme for five years the paper ignores this simple logic
6644156 where is the incentive to modify industrial processes if sections of industry will be shielded from any need to change their investment decisions
6644157 while the green paper includes transport in its scheme it effectively neutralizes any need to modify personal or business travel behaviour
6644158 the scheme just leaves our transport system in its currently unsustainable position where millions of australians battle daily traffic gridlock because public transport services are unavailable unreliable or too costly
6644159 where is the incentive for the vehicle industry to switch to lower carbon and renewable energy sources and components for its products
6644160 where is the incentive to encourage the renewable energy industry when the coal fired power generators are given special concessions and provided with massive public subsidies to research if and how they could sequester the greenhouse gases they emit every day
6644161 where are the energy efficiency requirements or incentives unless the proposed scheme fixes specific targets and quotas in conjunction with incentives and extensive information programs for householders it will not achieve its aims and objectives

6644164 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6644165 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6644166 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6644167 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6644168 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6644169 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6644170 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6644171 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6644172 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6644173 la past que tout comme le c libataire ne sont plus dans une logique de reproduction
6644174 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6644175 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6644176 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6644177 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6644178 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6644179 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6644180 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6644181 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6644182 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6644183 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6644184 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6644185 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6644186 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6644187 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6644188 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6644189 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6644190 it doesnt mean a woman has to stop living a glamorous life theres a critical need to teach people about diabetes management in a new way without the ho hum presentation
6644191 since 2006 almost 5 000 women affected by diabetes have experienced this diva brand of diabetes outreach weve found that intimate conversations along with beauty services music prize giveaways and fun can have an amazing impact on a womans attitude about diabetes and lift her spirits

6644248 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6644249 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that

6644255 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

6644307 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6644308 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6644309 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6644310 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6644311 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6644312 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6644313 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6644314 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6644315 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6644316 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6644317 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6644318 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6644319 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6644320 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6644321 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6644322 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6644323 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6644324 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6644325 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6644326 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6644327 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6644328 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6644329 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6644330 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6644331 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6644332 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6644333 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6644334 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6644335 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6644336 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6644337 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6644338 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6644339 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6644340 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6644341 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6644342 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6644343 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6644344 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6644345 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6644346 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6644347 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6644348 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6644349 oh no dude my mom just sent me a request to be my friend on facebook what should i do
6644350 in the first half we werent knocking down shots but we were playing great defense and that was what allowed us to stay in the game
6644351 coach said that defense was the difference between today and two years ago
6644352 two years ago we had the same thing where we couldnt score but then we couldnt keep them from scoring but this year we found a way to play as a unit and get those stops
6644353 we always talk about offensively we are going to find a way to score enough points to win
6644354 look at the firepower we have for us our goal is to hold the other team under 60 points this russia is a team coming in so prolific on the offensive end coach said going in that she thought our defense was going to win the game for us and it came true

6644372 the fact that john mccain dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so called independent committee shows how desperate he is to change the subject from his shocking disconnect with the economic struggles of the american people

6644385 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6644386 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6644387 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6644388 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6644430 the investigations found that all the mis are either insolvent on a cash flow basis a balance sheet basis or on the basis of the accounts kept by pwl have no assets or liabilities deloittes said today
6644431 further mis involving the growing of grapes would require members to pay more funds than they are likely to receive in revenue for the remainder of those mis

6644435 my foot has been bothering me for about a year
6644436 about 70 or 80 meters into the race i felt something tear
6644437 i went under the stadium and had a doctor look at it he gave me some injections that did really well but in the long jump it started to hurt again
6644438 i told my coach there is no way i can take a second shot
6644439 i realized id have to get an injection after every event and it just wasnt worth it
6644440 it was deja vu it definitely brought the memories right back
6644441 ever since 04 i have never been quite healthy this has been bothering since last year at least now that it has ruptured maybe it will start to heal
6644442 i wont make any decisions until i see how my foot goes well see
6644443 no that is not true we have not pulled out of the champions trophy but we have advised the icc about our considerable concern and we have made sure that they understand that we will not go anywhere which is not safe we are waiting to hear from them later this evening
6644444 ca at this stage hasnt made any official decision to not tour we are waiting to hear from icc the ball is in their court
6644445 we are very willing to tour pakistan we are very keen to do so and we will visit pakistan as long as the safety and security advisors say that it is safe
6644446 the only issue that is important for us is the safety and security of the players and the advice we get from our range of sources

6644666 just a hymn my grandmother loved i used to play
6644667 four and a half minutes of the time alloted me to introduce to you a young woman who can speak more deftly than i on the benefits lakosha and the united states of america can bring one another aleen mackensin came of age in the greater washington area and resided here until she wandered accidentally through the portal between our lands she was to our deep regret made a prisoner by a woman who betrayed all our lakoshan values and kept in slavery for 3 years until a chance discovery revealed her and the other women here tonight
6644668 the lady and i were so impressed with miss mackensins leadership ability and composure in the face of all she suffered that we invited her to return to lakosha to take charge of the estate of the woman that had imprisoned her
6644669 ladies and gentleman i ask you to welcome the new american diplomatic liaison to lakosha aleen mackensin
6644670 since you have declined our offer albeit for a very good reason we are reduced to presenting another honor
6644671 it is my understanding that the united states does not allow dual citizenship with other nations this appears however not to be immutable aleen mackensin as the emperor of lakosha and guardian of her citizens i am delighted to confer lakoshan citizenship on you for your service to lakosha and the women under your care in the elissien lands further in gratitude for such care a portion of those lands has been deeded to you and the lady and i will personally fund construction of a home there for you for your use as a retreat or for whatever purpose you choose
6644672 ok lets get this out right from the beginning because i see those dirty looks youre giving my lakoshan friends it was not lakosha that held any of us prisoner the woman that kept us as her se her slaves was a sick and twisted woman a perversion of all lakosha stands for
6644673 the lady genevieve parsons malenn whom many of you know through her work here before her marriage was also a prisoner of the same woman at one point
6644674 and she and the lord are the ones who found and freed us the people youre glaring at are the good guys so stop it ok
6644675 now that weve got that out of the way let me say that i am delighted to be returning to lakosha as the american liaison the peace i have found in lakosha and the energy of the us are complementary and each brings something very vital to our relationship i truly hope that these two great nations will further their accord through my offices and find lasting friendship despite our separate spheres i offer my sincere thanks to the president and the lord for offering me this opportunity to bridge the cultural divide between lakosha and america as well as my deepest gratitude to the lord and lady for the honor of citizenship and to the president for allowing me to accept it thank you
6644676 to close on a personal note let me carry the theme of gratitude for yet a little longer as miss mackensin alluded my amazing wife my soulmate is originally from this side of the portal i would like to thank her for making todays treaty possible there is no one who could be a better champion and no one whom i could love more thank you and enjoy your evening
6644677 i believe that i am now that the boring bits are over
6644678 the president made my ears tired it was all i could do not to just say ive believe everythings been said here listen to aleen
6644679 probably best that i dont drag you off into the garden and make passionate love to you right there either
6644680 unfortunately i think youre probably right about that as well
6644681 i squeeze a few minutes in every morning it should be more but ive come to accept over the years that ill never be a concert pianist
6644682 im told you were a concert pianist at one point
6644683 not as much as i used to when i chose smith over curtis i had to accept as you did that continuing at that level just wasnt going to happen at least not for long
6644684 life is a series of choices not all of them easy isnt it excuse me
6644685 mozart 20 third movement of beethoven 1 probably the first movement of beethoven 5 most of mozart 19
6644686 the orchestra shuffles music and i stare the first lady pushes me toward the piano mara who has been hovering around me most of the evening materializes again worried
6644687 to be able to offer you this evening the 3rd movement of beethovens first piano concerto
6644688 i havent played this anything in public in 17 years
6644689 i cant fucking believe im doing this i havent warmed up ive never used this piano this is just fucking nuts
6644690 as genevieve margaret parsons tonights soloist has played with orchestras around the world won or placed at innumerable piano competitions including a first at the oberlin international piano competition a first at the fulbright concerto competition a second at the chopin competition and a finalist in the 1991 van cliburn competition she last played in concert some 17 years ago upon the completion of that years cliburn concert series we are privileged to hear her tonight
6644691 dont do that to me for gods sake i havent touched a piano in 2 years
6644692 somebody had to conduct anyway you were always ten times the pianist i was i play dance stuff these days not the concert stuff
6644693 speaking of that how the hell did you happen to have the right music
6644694 genny from the time i first met you we were 12 you played the same pieces whenever you could if you were going to play i knew it had to be something your bones knew
6644695 25 years 3 months and a couple of weeks give or take in which time we played 21 competitions together
6644696 its good to see you email me i want to meet your partner
6644697 well be here all night ill catch you at the end
6644698 goddess every time i think i know all there is to know about you another rabbit pops out of the hole
6644699 your eyes are sparkling more brightly than ive ever seen
6644700 im far too pleased to even pretend to be angry
6644701 oh and theres so much more money out there for conductors
6644702 but yeah its a good thing jasons got a real job
6644703 tall yes klutzy maybe but pudgy not very very quiet but driven man was she driven and probably the most incredible pianist ive ever heard the music that came out of those fingers was phenomenal i mean you heard her tonight and she hasnt even played in 2 years i had such a crush on her and i knew i was gay even then
6644704 she was very mature for her age most kids came to competitions with an entourage the mother the teacher the grandparents she came by herself every time
6644705 my mom had to work it was just us and i couldnt pay for my teacher to come
6644706 i wondered why i always thought it was kind of sad youd be up there accepting awards all by yourself no one to cheer for you
6644707 it wasnt no one you always cheered for me doofus and your mom did too
6644708 you remember all that guess you were paying a lot more attention than it looked like
6644709 i paid a lot of attention to the world around me had to keep it from biting me in the ass but even if i hadnt been its kind of hard to ignore an almost naked 6 5 kid in a hotel hallway yanking on a door that clearly isnt going to open particularly when he was wearing underoos with several gaping holes
6644710 so thats what that red and blue rag in your dresser is
6644711 im glad you found a place in life that fits

6644791 it was a flight from singapore to siem reap it was a very rainy day
6644792 when staff did a go around of the aircraft after landing they discovered that one of the left hand tyres wasnt fully deflated but it obviously had some cuts on it and there was mud on the aircraft
6644793 there was not permanent damage to the aircraft and no injury to passengers
6644794 because there was only damage to the left hand wheels it would be incorrect to say that the aircraft totally left the runway there was nothing wrong with the right hand wheels
6644795 left the runway and blew a tyre and scraped the ground

6644809 its had a couple of rallies up toward these levels and its just failed mr vrondas said
6644810 i think todays move is just a little bit of profit taking really
6644811 if we see some demand for euro against the us dollar when europe steps in then that will probably help the aussie mr vrondas said
6644812 it appears as though the market is still relatively buoyed at the moment on the back of the performance in commodities

6644823 it seems however that muhammed himself was at first doubtful of the source of these revelations fearing that he was possessed by one of the jinn or sprites as was commonly believed to be the case with arab poets and soothsayers but khadijah his wife and others reassured him and he soon began to propound divine revelations with increasing frequency
6644824 the problem is that the government is powerless to be able to take steps to force him to come back

6644852 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
6644853 the news coverage has been far from fair and balanced especially during the first days of the crisis
6644854 it is still not quite clear whether the west was aware of mr saakashvilis plans to invade south ossetia and this is a serious matter
6644855 what is clear is that western assistance in training georgian troops and shipping large supplies of arms had been pushing the region toward war rather than peace

6644884 since we continue to believe the attack will likely come before the end of may or at the latest june we think it is likely the attack will come between may 11 2008 and june 30 2008 if not then with near certainty before the us elections in november should the attack not come before bush leaves office the chances of a major attack on iran would be greatly diminished no matter which of the three remaining major candidates takes office in his place even if potential war provoking incidents between the us and iran were to occur and this is why the israel lobby is pressing bush to act before it is too late
6644885 following bushs return to washington the administration studied israels request and this led it to suspect that israel was planning to attack iran within the next few months the americans therefore decided to send a strong message warning it not to do so
6644886 u s national intelligence director mike mcconnell and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mike mullen both visited here in june and according to the washington post told senior israeli defense officials that iran is still far from obtaining nuclear weapons and that an attack on iran would undermine american interests therefore they said the u s would not allow israeli planes to overfly iraq en route to iran

6644895 finally we have a common standard for people serious about implementing 3d city models that take us beyond beautiful visualizations combining quality graphics with robust information and topological models citygml will change the way professionals manage virtual cities
6644896 this open interoperable and extensible platform has already been effectively implemented in dozens of jurisdictions
6644897 however the incorporation of citygml read write support into fme is perhaps the single most important next step towards broad adoption of 3d city models in the geospatial industry i look forward to the rapid adoption of this platform which is designed to support next generation 3d solutions
6644898 we are committed to supporting ogc standards and encouraging data interoperability in the various segments of the spatial data world including 3d
6644899 this in mind extending our support for the newest ogc specification citygml was a natural choice we look forward to seeing the power of data interoperability that citygml holds unfold in projects around the globe

6644907 we ended up making it to montreal just in time for our video shoot for time immemorial the location was awesome as it was apparently a haunted house didnt see any ghosts though that wouldve been cool as it might have filled in the 13 hours of time spent waiting for stus acting career to take flight in all seriousness it was a very cool experience and i think the video is going to be awesome thanks to the director craig and the rest of the crew for making it a time that was truly immemorial

6645005 yes it is excellent that justice gabelman is on the wi sc
6645006 for example should the wi sc reverse the court of appealss ruling that would open the door to an additional theory of recovery beyond the failure to warn claims that were tried in thomas
6645007 with justice gableman seated his presence significantly increases the chances that the defendants will prevail
6645008 justices gableman prosser and ziegler are considered favorable to the defendants in fact justice prosser had been a dissenter in thomas and justice ziegler had been elected after thomas
6645009 i anticipate that we can expect justices abrahamson and bradley to support the plaintiff justice crooks is probably a swing vote
6645010 so as i see it in order for the plaintiff to prevail he will need not only justice crookss swing vote but also one of the more conservative justices to also vote for him
6645011 but as we found out from the ri sc oral arguments on the lead paint public nuisance case and its subsequent ruling overturning the verdict against the defendants never ever ever assume one knows what a state sc will decide

6645021 the flames were so intense they burnt trees around the property the entire home was fully involved very quickly and totally destroyed

6645024 it was a flight from singapore to siem reap it was a very rainy day
6645025 when staff did a go around of the aircraft after landing they discovered that one of the left hand tyres wasnt fully deflated but it obviously had some cuts on it and there was mud on the aircraft
6645026 there was not permanent damage to the aircraft and no injury to passengers
6645027 because there was only damage to the left hand wheels it would be incorrect to say that the aircraft totally left the runway there was nothing wrong with the right hand wheels
6645028 left the runway and blew a tyre and scraped the ground
6645029 weve been told that technical difficulties in siem reap have caused the cancellation for a full 24 hours

6645036 its had a couple of rallies up toward these levels and its just failed mr vrondas said
6645037 i think todays move is just a little bit of profit taking really
6645038 if we see some demand for euro against the us dollar when europe steps in then that will probably help the aussie mr vrondas said
6645039 it appears as though the market is still relatively buoyed at the moment on the back of the performance in commodities
6645040 we might see a bit more of a pullback in the us dollar
6645041 i will support more electric power generation consider nuclear power generation lowering of the gas tax and the writing of policies that put more emphasis on the development of connecticuts urban centers i believe if residents of the 23rd district just look at the rocky road theyve been down they will be willing to give a qualified alternative candidate a chance
6645042 my opponent hopes that bridgeporters dont realize who has put them in the situation the city now finds itself i believe my fellow citizens are smart enough to vote for change change that means considering alternatives to high gas taxes and government spending

6645086 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get

6645090 if funding costs continue at the current levels and the reserve bank do actually cut rates then there will be a full flow on to our mortgage customers
6645091 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down he said

6645134 hes a very very good athlete but his strength is his mind
6645135 most talented no thats probably a good way to describe it but hes mentally the toughest ill tell you thats the key theres no one that matches that
6645136 i would definitely say lampford is the best of all of us in terms of speed
6645137 his speed is unparalleled with the rest of us but thats why i like doing sports psychology its so much more mental than physical
6645138 if he gets to the corner hell put the fear of god in you
6645139 theyre not rare thats the expectation if youre going to be the guy
6645140 its a north south guy its an all the time back its an every down back and its a guy thats productive you saw it in b j mitchell you see it in luke chris lemon foger its a special deal when we name a guy a nevada back
6645141 the one thing ive learned is youre going to have to be out here anyways its going to be hot the coaches are going to yell at you
6645142 get everything out of everything they teach you get something out of everything you do at practice dont just go through the motions it translates to the visualization thing if you hit the pads hard its muscle memory when a blocker comes up youre going to hit him hard no matter what
6645143 coach mastro basically showed me the way for everything i attribute all my success to him and the way he teaches everything i do hes trying to help me so i dont just go through the motions so that i do it correctly
6645144 theres a lot more personal pressure on myself in terms of what i want to do as far as goals for the season
6645145 i feel like its the perfect chance for our team to win and for me to get personal goals done
6645146 i want the school record for season rushing if i do that everything will fall into place well probably be winning
6645147 sometimes i wonder what would have happened if i was still at safety
6645148 when i look back i feel god had a plan for me in terms of getting hurt and then making the switch
6645149 this is what we wanted to see i have kept asking when is it we are going to get things to go our way because it never did now i think it is the right time if it is to happen this is the right time for it to happen
6645150 i got myself in trouble trying not to let chipper beat me in that situation and then hung a changeup to mccann that was pretty much it
6645151 i am starting feel more comfortable and you can see more consistency i am coming around some teams give me more difficulty than others but i seem to be doing what i want to be doing
6645152 you know ive been asking when we were going to get things going our way
6645153 things never seemed to go our way but now i think this is the right time were catching breaks but were fighting for those breaks too
6645154 weve been able to find a way to win ballgames and we werent doing that early in the year the good teams do that

6645182 ramadhan adalah saat untuk kita lebih full bersungguh sungguh menjalankan ibadah
6645183 enggak tau mengalir begitu aja tadinya cita citaku ingin jadi sekretaris
6645184 recib la invitaci n para venir a esta importante exposici n donde se muestra todo el potencial del sector agroindustrial de nuestro pa s y que trasciende c rdoba estoy dispuesto a recorrerla y a observar en cada uno de sus stands el progreso y la innovaci n tecnol gica estamos aqu para apoyar esto porque es el premio al esfuerzo y al trabajo de un a o adem s para ver la problem tica que enfrenta la producci n
6645185 tenemos que apoyar a todos los sectores de la producci n y encontrar en forma conjunta las soluciones para planificar un pa s a largo plazo necesitamos que el sector de la producci n trabaje codo a codo y obviamente sabemos que hay intereses sectoriales que a veces se defienden pero tambi n est el gobierno que tiene que encontrar
6645186 yo le he pedido al campo prudencia y paciencia han demostrado que se pueden conseguir cosas trabajando unidos pero tambi n los argentinos queremos tranquilidad y vivir con paz social y s que hoy por ejemplo van a ser recibidos en la secretar a de agricultura representantes de los sectores tamberos y de la carne seguramente el secretario anunciar medidas en los medios period sticos se est informando que hay un aumento en el valor del corte en las exportaciones como tambi n en un mayor reconocimiento hacia el productor con el tema de la cuota hilton de la carne y otros aspectos que tienen que ver con la liberaci n de las exportaciones
6645187 el debate en el congreso siempre est latente pero lo cierto es que la secretar a de agricultura es el organismo ejecutivo que tiene que dar las respuestas hay varios proyectos en el senado que hay que ir consensuando para ver c mo se puede dar una respuesta desde el congreso
6645188 cuando uno imagina un pa s a largo plazo tiene que pensar en planes estrat gicos que permitan una planificaci n ordenada del sector yo siempre pongo de ejemplo cuando desde mi provincia trabajamos en el plan estrat gico vitivin cola que se planific en el sector a veinte a os y que hoy se est n cumpliendo las metas establecidas esto es lo que hay que trabajar en las negociaciones con el campo el anterior jefe de gabinete present quince puntos creo que hay que volver a esos puntos y con paciencia y prudencia trabajar pensando en el futuro
6645189 nosotros hemos establecido una coherencia desde que se vot la f rmula sabiendo que conform bamos un espacio pol tico diferente y que pod amos tener visiones distintas pero siempre aportando y acompa ando para la soluci n de los problemas
6645190 lo bueno es que hoy a las 18 30 el gobernador schiaretti ha sido convocado por el gobierno nacional es una buena oportunidad para que se vean los problemas en general yo siempre dec a que los gobernadores tienen que ser parte del problema y la soluci n porque son los que conducen la econom a provincial lo bueno es que ahora se re nan y tengan una visi n en conjunto m s all de los problemas que en particular tiene cada provincia lo importante es que se logre la soluci n en el tema de la caja de jubilaci n y en el tema de los acuerdos previos hay una partida en el presupuesto de 570 millones de pesos para atender el d ficit de la caja hay que pagarlo de alguna forma en cuotas por ejemplo la informaci n que tengo del gobernador es que no se giraron las cuotas lo cual motiv que el d ficit se acreciente y despu s hay otro problema con el programa de financiamiento ordenado me parece que m s all de las diferentes posturas los cordobeses merecen que sean atendidos por igual sin diferencias con las otras provincias
6645191 el proyecto de aerol neas que se va a tratar fue enriquecido y casi no tiene nada que ver con el proyecto inicial lo que demuestra tambi n que hubo amplitud en el bloque oficialista en captar y recibir todas las inquietudes de los legisladores el mayor problema que ten a era afinar el acta acuerdo porque en ella se establec a el valor de las acciones y eso quedaba establecido por un tercero hoy esto lo hace la comisi n de tasaci n nacional es el estado el que va a poner el precio conforme a la realidad de los activos y pasivos que tenga la empresa en segundo lugar el valor tiene que volver al congreso entonces est n dadas todas las garant as de transparencia y de seguimiento por parte de la comisi n bicameral y por parte de la auditoria general de la naci n
6645192 yo ocupo un cargo que me toca conducir una parte del congreso la otra est a cargo del doctor fellner mis atribuciones est n limitadas a eso en lo que pueda colaborar lo har en consensuar los proyectos de ley en dar una opini n o un consejo lo seguir haciendo pero sin interferir
6645193 si se hace una empresa nueva con los mismos empleados no es f cil
6645194 habl con el diputado agust n rossi pidi ndole que traten el proyecto que hab a sido sancionado en el senado el mismo establece que se dar n 20 millones de pesos en apoyo para la pampa 40 millones de pesos para el chaco y 20 millones de pesos para parte de santa fe me respondi rossi que estaba en tratativas con el secretario de agricultura y que el tema va a ser tratado la pr xima semana y con miras a incluir situaci n de c rdoba y santiago del estero debemos declarar la emergencia en la regi n como paso previo porque exime del pago de algunos impuestos para palear el impacto de este problema
6645195 entre las conversaciones que tuve con la presidenta le suger desdoblar el ministerio de econom a en uno de hacienda y otro de producci n porque me parece que es la forma de que se tenga una visi n planificada hacia futuro de generaci n de riqueza ahora esa decisi n depende de la presidenta
6645196 como vicepresidente de la naci n hac a estas cosas antes cuando no era muy conocido y donde ustedes los periodistas no asist an he estado recorriendo el pa s he ido a salta en las inundaciones en c rdoba con el gobernador schiaretti habilitamos el acueducto en marull en fin yo sigo realizando mi trabajo como lo hice siempre
6645197 quienes estamos en pol tica siempre estamos escuchando y receptando los problemas de la gente y colaboramos para la unidad de los argentinos
6645198 nosotros vamos a seguir acompa ando aquellas cosas que creemos est n bien y dando nuestro aporte debemos colaborar con este gobierno y marcar diferencias cuando uno crea que sirven para ayudar
6645199 yo nunca me fui del radicalismo fue el radicalismo quien me impuso una sanci n disciplinaria voy a luchar por la unidad de la ucr y har todo el esfuerzo necesario para que este partido que hoy tiene muchas intervenciones en diferentes distritos recupere la institucionalidad esto se logra cuando los propios afiliados a trav s de procesos limpios y transparentes en internas abiertas definen sus autoridades partidarias y el rumbo definitivo del radicalismo
6645200 m s all de los nombres que es una decisi n del ejecutivo todos queremos que el indec recupere la credibilidad esto se hace acordando m todos con las distintas provincias y definiendo mecanismos que devuelvan la credibilidad perdida moreno es funcionario del gobierno nacional y su destino depende de sus superiores

6645218 from our perspective the plans creators really missed the ball on the issue of what sustainability means
6645219 our draft resolution is a reconfirmation of the six point agreement and theres no territorial integrity in the six principles
6645220 we believe the six principles are clear and already implemented
6645221 what we see on the ground is the result of ambiguity
6645222 we have a presence of so called russian peacekeeping forces at key georgian choke points that will control economic life it will control humanitarian activities thats why clarifications are so important
6645223 theres no way that russian positions can be considered in line with the resolution
6645224 my eyebrows must have shot up because i was informed
6645225 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6645226 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6645227 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6645228 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6645229 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6645230 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6645231 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6645232 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6645233 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture

6645238 the doldrums are a belt of low pressure that extends 5 to 10 either side of the equator they were notorious in the days of sail because vessels could become becalmed there for many days and even weeks being in the doldrums has now become synonymous with being listless depressed and generally stuck in a rut

6645246 this was a great test tonight it was a truly special atmosphere and felt like a big east road game at the end we didnt play as well as we did in out previous three outings but we showed our character and battled through some tough stretches in the game where things may not have been going our way notre dame head coach mike brey said with each game we play we are finding out what our identity is and tonight was a good test for us ireland came out ready to play and that created such a great setting for a great basketball game

6645251 animals and birds are lucky they dont keep acquiring things the way men do you can teach a monkey to drive a motorcycle but i have never known a monkey to go out and buy a motorcycle
6645252 i will work as hard as i can to make sure that i am able to earn a spot at the university of texas as soon as possible
6645253 he and i became really good friends we were there in the tough times in the good times too
6645254 he is really going to be missed in the nfl and by football generally
6645255 obviously life moves on but i dont know that anybody can replace gene upshaw
6645256 the games the most important thing and thats what youre trying to protect
6645257 he saw that and i saw that with him we just started that and as you do with friendship youre with people for a time when i had my 50th wedding anniversary he and his wife terry came we had that kind of relationship
6645258 he came to my fathers and my mothers funerals we were pretty close
6645259 i played against him when i was with the houston oilers and he was with the raiders he was a great player his leadership will be missed by all in the nfl
6645260 i think overall for the players you can throw darts at gene all over the board but he did far more than anybody who ever started in this business free agency and where the system is is far better than any player ever imagined
6645261 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
6645262 a lituania lo conocemos muy bien son un equipo duro pero creo que el resultado final depender de nosotros
6645263 los jugadores lituanos son expertos en tiros desde lejos y defienden con mucha intensidad pero lo mejor de ellos es que tienen mucho talento
6645264 when we announced our decision to leave our current television series after seven years we were very touched by the number of people friends family guests viewers and broadcasters who told us how much they wanted to see us continuing making programmes together

6645266 una de las razones clave para el xito del chevrolet cobalt y el pontiac g5 es la mano de obra de lordstown y la fuerte alianza de la uaw

6645272 im really lucky i get to do this im gonna ride it as long as i can
6645273 all right it was a good run and its over
6645274 if you do this then you might be a white person
6645275 im white and i dont like anything on this list so i find this very offensive
6645276 so youre offended that ive made a generalization about your race that doesnt apply to you i think every other minority on earth has been through this in the last thousand years so good im glad you feel that way
6645277 theres a big difference between these stereotypes and other stereotypes the difference is white people dont get denied jobs for liking yoga these arent hateful stereotypes theyre not demeaning stereotypes theres a big difference in where its going theres not a hateful aspect
6645278 its just another weird circumstance thats come up and nobody can explain when or why it happened

6645286 the people of this village have been wary of the coalition forces for the past several years because they have seen units come and go and promises made that were never fulfilled
6645287 we wanted to assure them that we were different and to help prove our resolve we lived among them in their impoverished community experiencing for a short time the life they have always known
6645288 one of our main goals at this point is to put control of all future developments into the hands of the iraqi people
6645289 we want iraqi people in charge of iraqi projects using iraqi money and iraqi workers as soon as possible which will further stabilize the country and allow our forces to withdraw
6645290 no matter how big or small our operations might be we remain dedicated in our efforts to help the iraqi people gain a new life
6645291 despite the best of intentions it is impossible to change the minds of everyone but every little bit helps each new gesture that makes a difference is another step closer to permanent change
6645292 when i talk to my family and friends back home they want to know what its really like over here and if we are truly making a difference
6645293 each time i have explained to them the kind of change they have not witnessed yet battles and lethal operations have long ago ceased to be priorities our focus now is a return to normalcy living and working and interacting with the iraqi people positive changes are happening every day they might not be big or flashy but they are making lasting improvements that have already put victory for the iraqi people within their reach

6645300 although a whale whisperer is certainly an expert to be respected my own vision of positive change and hope can be incorporated into a new and powerful form of whale whispering that will heal colin yes i can

6645304 the tough times are forcing firms to evaluate their business plans and look for help to ride out the storm
6645305 when the markets recover firms will choose to tap the market again but they may now also go to pe as they are recognising the value add that pe brings
6645306 even speaking to a private equity firm was unheard of a couple of years ago for a family owned business
6645307 they see the merit now in selling non core assets or a stake to pe it is seen as a better option to selling out to a rival
6645308 they want more than just a cheque they now want smart money
6645309 there have been some high profile deals and even buyouts like blackstones buyout of gokaldas exports
6645310 founders have gotten used to aggressive valuations and many are prepared to wait for the markets to recover
6645311 pe is also waiting in the hope of lower valuations whether deals get done now is a matter of who will blink first
6645312 lo m s escandaloso es que no es la primera vez que el gobierno demuestra ser completamente incapaz de proteger la integridad de informaci n altamente sensible lo que le incapacita para encomendarle la protecci n de nuestra seguridad

6645315 we are coming apart at the seams in every sense

6645318 there is a meal missing either it wasnt loaded or there are more passengers than we had booked
6645319 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
6645320 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
6645321 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
6645322 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves

6645325 but coming out of this summers tennis activity our feeling is it was time for nike to take that approach and make it a little broader
6645326 we may be seeing two of the best players ever go at it in a way that tennis hasnt seen in a while and its time to see how that transcends from the most loyal tennis fan to all other sports fans or anyone who follows pop culture the underlying idea is that we make sure all of new york knows about this we are asking them to pick a side and hopefully people will get engaged and start talking about it
6645327 we worked with wieden to develop the don king idea and when we brought don in we restructured our original idea around some of his insights
6645328 how often do we bring a third creative partner to the table with a veteran marketing agency and shake things up by saying hey
6645329 and nike has always been about collaboration with its athletes so we brought in a promotional expert to help promote the u s open and this rivalry in a way that maybe we havent done in a very long time
6645330 well also use the viral video space to make sure that for the next two weeks we continue to push messages celebrating roger rafa the u s open and new york city
6645331 capturing the excitement of tennis in new york for the next two weeks
6645332 were keeping our fingers crossed that they do meet thats the whole point and we honestly think that they will especially the way they have been playing lately
6645333 but even if they dont it will be a great moment for nike tennis and these two players and the city of new york

6645341 with the value of hindsight our 42m capital raising late last year was well timed and this coupled with strong trading profits and cash flows provides ebos with an excellent base from which to continue to pursue new growth opportunities
6645342 we expect our regular trading markets to remain competitive with some softness in the retail environment

6645346 faith is a living and unshakeable confidence a belief in the grace of god so assured that a man would die a thousand deaths for its sake
6645347 god creates out of nothing wonderful you say yes to be sure but he does what is still more wonderful he makes saints out of sinners

6645353 we wanted to do an environmental showcase on a modest budget
6645354 if an energy star house is 5 000 more thats inconsequential on a 30 year mortgage
6645355 being sustainable is a natural extension of our mission as a model for a healthy environment and doing the right thing
6645356 its getting to the point where its irresponsible not to

6645359 why are there three record shops in this city when there once was 167
6645360 i loved this business but 15 years ago the industry started dropping out from the independents and going with the mass merchandisers best buy circuit city and wal mart and those three places sell cds below cost my cost from a distributor is 12 97 theyre retailing them at 10 99
6645361 the city could have helped by supporting this collection as a museum
6645362 the heinz history center said theyd take the records by the local pittsburgh artists but i wouldnt split that out of my collection
6645363 now on a saturday if i do 200 today its a miracle
6645364 pittsburgh is such a famous city for music do you think anybody knows that
6645365 they dont even know the artists i go to their funerals and theres nobody there some of the people who wrote some of the grandest music that exists and they dont even know who the hell they are
6645366 its mind boggling to think that 1 billion people are currently without the most basic human need
6645367 water is extremely important and im happy that this is helping

6645370 obama has a lot of online support and hes affiliated one way or another with a couple of sleazy people as well as some people whose politics are to the left of his own
6645371 barack is wishing speaker pelosi a good vacation while gas prices remain high
6645372 though khalidi has seen little of sen obama in recent years michelle obama attended a party several months ago celebrating the marriage of the khalidis daughter
6645373 he was an eight year old child when ayers and the weathermen were active and any attempt to connect obama with events of almost 40 years ago is ridiculous
6645374 we are aware of that incident and we are looking into it
6645375 ill tell you what this is a very very aggressive schedule if they dont get this building closed in in the good weather they have a big problem
6645376 we need to get on a fast track to get the building enclosed so winter wont have an impact
6645377 we got a good jump on it right now because we were able to get so much of the steel and precast erected
6645378 i fully expect well be having lights on at night
6645379 we dont think its going to be a substantial or significant impact fans will have to make some adjustments but we dont think its going to dramatically affect traffic flows
6645380 the continued development of the north shore is a positive for the city but we can expect to deal with some traffic issues due to construction during the process
6645381 we continue to recommend that people take advantage of the many downtown parking options available to them and we will regularly update our fans on the best possible alternative routes to take on steelers game days and for heinz field events

6645384 stimulate informed and dispassionate public discussion about the presence of alcohol in american culture and to consider policies that will effectively empower young adults age 18 to 20 to make mature decisions about the place of alcohol in their own lives
6645385 alcohol is a reality in the lives of young americans
6645386 culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus has developed
6645387 it defies logic that anyone would want to go backwards when obvious progress has been made especially at a time when so much emphasis is being placed on teen driver safety
6645388 do we really want high school kids to have the opportunity to legally purchase beer
6645389 far more teens die in alcohol related incidents than in those caused by all the other illicit drugs combined
6645390 lowering the drinking age to 18 will only make it worse
6645391 underage and binge drinking is a tough problem and we welcome an honest discussion about how to address this challenge but that discussion must honor the science behind the 21 law which unequivocally shows that the 21 law has reduced drunk driving and underage and binge drinking

6645480 theres too much information in todays world and our defense
6645481 not only do we have great passenger numbers the airport also consistently ranks high in customer satisfaction and thats with all the new construction
6645482 there is sort of no place for them to run
6645483 without question the situation was not handled very well by officer stephens
6645484 but the characterization of the story has led to death threats against the officer and his family by telephone
6645485 seemed to capture the beleaguered mindset of the u k commercial real estate market
6645486 as we anticipated the commercial property market has become more challenging in response to the credit crunch and slowing economies there is confusion and an element of denial over direct property pricing due to lack of transactions
6645487 er ging in den teich in der hoffnung gesegnet zu werden als ein krokodil ihn angriff und in den tiefen teil des teiches zerrte

6645489 the machine that changed the world the story of lean production
6645490 they should put their eyes out so they cant commit any more crimes
6645491 prison isnt a solution anymore they just form their own gangs inside prison and come out stronger
6645492 if they cant they should resign but they should not keep occupying government offices and getting paid to do nothing
6645493 a spiderweb of corruption has penetrated many parts of our department
6645494 that is why kidnapping has grown more competitive with kidnappers using much more violence against each other and against the victims in a bid to gain territory markets or dominance
6645495 we are thrilled to recognize the 2008 davidson fellows not only for their incredible projects but also for the journey they forged to reach this point
6645496 each year the breadth and depth of fellows accomplishments overwhelm us with nurturing gifted students will be among those who will solve the worlds most vexing problems now and in the future
6645497 our goal is to not have any student left behind
6645498 we applaud the tenacity of these and other profoundly gifted children who often take it upon themselves to gather the resources they need to succeed
6645499 you dont know me a citizens guide to republican family values
6645500 the whole story hasnt been told i think john edwards is a bad example for democrats and i cant defend him i just think theres more of this going on with republicans and theyre more hypocritical about it
6645501 survived the monica lewinsky scandal quite well the republicans thought he would have to leave office in disgrace and it didnt work out that way
6645502 all the democrats whore running im backing jeff merkley against sen gordon smith i originally wasnt optimistic about his chances but i am now
6645503 the book division is relatively new and its been a bit of a struggle
6645504 i hope it turns out we havent found a best seller yet but when i got into it people told me it was like roulette
6645505 when a triggering agent such as a volatile anesthetic is introduced into an mh susceptible persons body increased temperature and muscle rigidity can occur leading to muscle damage and release of ions and proteins into the blood
6645506 this can result in the death of the patient due to an irregular heart beat or kidney failure after the surgical procedure
6645507 proving the causative role of a new mutation enables researchers to include it in the list of mh mutations and makes the genetic test more reliable
6645508 this is an important step toward establishing an inexpensive and minimally invasive genetic test for diagnosing mh this new mutation should therefore be included in the current list of mh causing mutations

6645516 hey we messed around the studio one afternoon check this out
6645517 we all did it me dylan ritchie havens john hammond all part of that scene
6645518 were warbling away on our carter family stuff and dylan walks by and sees us inside
6645519 i got a gig tonight dylan says hes worried the cut will keep him from playing and so we let him in and dressed his wound he felt a little sheepish about making a fuss over such a little cut so he asked if he could try out a new song
6645520 i knew dylan a little but i was not a big fan of the kind of protest songs he was mostly singing then i was much more into ralph stanley doc watson those guys
6645521 he sat down on a milk crate in the kitchen and played only a pawn in their game it was a revelation most of the protest songs id heard seemed jingoistic and overly simplistic they were all painted in black and white with the protest singers always being on the side of the angels and flattering their audiences with their own goodness but the song dylan sang that afternoon came from a deeper consciousness he saw that the small minded and bigoted people were only pawns too in a larger game in which corporate and political interests were manipulating them that was an epiphany and hes been some sort of important messenger to me ever since
6645522 i was there the night he got booed at newport when he went electric the technology could barely handle what dylan was bringing to that festival it was really primitive the dylan band that night was really the butterfield blues band without butterfield that was a million miles from what the folk purists had come to hear so they booed dylan just blew past all of that to where he had to go the place where he was headed all along
6645523 its so interesting to watch her active mind at work shes always thinking
6645524 her enthusiasm for just about anything life has to offer is undimmed
6645525 she couldnt cope anymore any conversation i had with her was about how she wanted to take care of her kids and she probably felt she couldnt do that anymore
6645526 she was so concerned about her daughters what would happen to them who would take care of them i know this sounds paradoxical but she felt that her daughters were suffering because she was failing to provide for them
6645527 we are all so upset because it happened to one of ours its a very tragic thing
6645528 i dont know what would prompt a mother to do that to her own children
6645529 their bodies will heal but its the spiritual part that i worry about
6645530 a poster child for whats going on in this economic crisis
6645531 the fear is the next shoe to drop may be commercial real estate
6645532 the risk here in commercial real estate is what happens when those loans mature in two three four five years
6645533 when these loans come up for refinancing unless the credit markets improve significantly the terms will be quite different
6645534 i know for sure what jesus would not do would be to sweep into a community gather up large numbers of people separate them from one another and deport them to another country in my own mind in my own conscience thats crystal clear jesus would not do that
6645535 we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counterproductive
6645536 we urge the federal government to fully respect the well founded principles of conscientious objection
6645537 would be better served by helping individuals to comply with the law or working to change those laws rather than asking law enforcement agents not to enforce it
6645538 if you choose to become a law enforcement officer you swear to uphold the laws of the state and the nation
6645539 thats what you do you dont want to do that then dont become a law enforcement officer
6645540 i think its an interesting idea because from our reports a lot of these raids have really impacted families and individuals and really terrorized communities
6645541 it should be logical that some agents think that tactic is too harsh and might not want to participate
6645542 this one of a kind conversation table was inspired by a paris flea market find then designed exclusively for us by a london graphic designer with a penchant for and a large personal collection of antique printers blocks
6645543 a lot of us put in a lot of time in the wieght room in the offseason and in the summer so that helps out
6645544 most of the 15 returning starters from last years championship team hit the weight room hard this offseason giving their team a new style of football to play this year
6645545 were strong were a real physical football team we hope that when you play us you know youve been in a football game because were going to hit you and i would say that is one of the strengths that we have
6645546 the teams first game is the 29th against rugby but theres a defenite consensus on which game will be the biggest this season
6645547 i would have to say velva looks pretty good this year theyve got a lot of people coming back but hopefully well step up to the challenge with our seniors and do the job

6645597 i am necessarily disadvantaged by an inability to assess the creditworthiness of the deponent or any other supporting witness the challenge lays out the structure of a cogent cross examination but i can do no more than guess at its ultimate effectiveness i suspect that it may very well achieve the extinction of any sense of unease that the present untested assertions are capable of creating but merely to state this is to note the distinction between what should be determined at inquiry and my task which is to determine whether an inquiry should be held

6645690 it was certainly a rougher time where your emphasis was more on reprisal retribution punishment
6645691 we were a rudderless ship there for years and years without oversight
6645692 we finally decided to take back control of our prisons
6645693 i think the forecast of continuing violence itself played a role in moving people to take seriously the problem of violence in prison
6645694 it correlates almost directly with when we started segregating all the gang members
6645695 they may not have been the ones perpetrating the violence but they were involved in calling the shots
6645696 weve been more successful nationally dealing with the anger that many people come to prison with
6645697 many people in mindanao are terrified of a return to a period when armed muslim insurgents and christian vigilante ilaga groups attacked civilians with impunity
6645698 i believe that in time the figure for the afghan army given the size of this country needs to be higher than the 120 000 figure
6645699 we deny the report we have no information whatsoever that french soldiers were killed by nato planes
6645700 the international forces have certainly prevented the taliban from retaking power in kabul but they are not numerous enough to control the whole country
6645701 while it is true that there is a summer offensive by the taliban it is also true that the tactics the taliban had to adopt are more of a guerrilla nature than a head on confrontation with our forces and we have been successful in winning back territory
6645702 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded on to a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost
6645703 this is a massive failure of duty it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data
6645704 we were trying to do the subtlest of subtle things
6645705 arming syria would lead to a strategic change and could destabilize the middle east and the world
6645706 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which do not violate the regional balance of power
6645707 why in the world would we need to deploy our missiles in syria against whom we have no enemies in the region
6645708 we understand russias stance regarding the breakaway regions and understand that it came in retaliation to georgian provocation
6645709 the timing of assads visit is very important it happens at the time when russia is very angry at the united states
6645710 it is highly possible that russia being so angered by the west and the united states now may sell something very nasty to syria
6645711 the non serpentinite rock bodies included in the serpentinite landscape and to a lesser extent calcium bearing accessory minerals in the serpentinite rock have the potential to act as a landscape fertilizer
6645712 we have known for some time that young and middle aged adults who are overweight run a higher risk of death and it was presumed that this held true for older people in fact our results show that the risk of dying is higher only for the most severely obese but that all older people who are overweight are at significantly increased risk of developing problems with mobility and carrying out everyday tasks
6645713 this research is important because a growing proportion of the population is aged 65 or over and more and more of these older people are overweight in fact in most developed countries middle aged and elderly adults are more likely to be obese than people in any other age group these findings have huge significance for the delivery of health care both now and in the future increasing numbers of older people and higher levels of overweight and obesity will lead to a greater burden of disability and ill health and place an immense strain on health and social services the issue is likely to get worse as time goes on and represents a ticking time bomb for health services around the world
6645714 staying a healthy weight can be a fun and relatively easy thing to do even as people get older
6645715 our experience of running supported walking and cycling groups has shown that older people benefit in many ways from regular physical activity
6645716 people are living longer but this study shows that excess weight can have a real impact on the quality of peoples lives which can reduce the benefit of those extra years we must do all we can to encourage older friends or relatives to build enjoyable exercise into their daily routine and develop good habits ourselves to take into our retirement years
6645717 this report highlights the problem of obesity in an increasingly ageing population
6645718 if you think of this world as a place intended simply for our happiness you find it quite intolerable think of it as a place of training and correction and its not so bad
6645719 if these antennae come up she is agitated so stop
6645720 so what your telling me is that im all tied up inside baby steps untie your knots
6645721 should i get down on that person should i be mad or forgive and let it pass should i be generous should i acknowledge that person and let them into my lane of traffic should i spend my time leisurely at movies or on the computer or should i find a way to help for others should i hoard my money or find places where it is need more than my bank account
6645722 good and evil both increase at compound interest that is why the little decisions you and i make everyday are of such infinite importance
6645723 baby step to four oclock baby step to four oclock
6645724 could you please take artistic liberties and to make your voyage more interesting to me oh maybe make some stuff up ok thanks
6645725 its a simple but powerful question what if we what if we take a risk what if we choose to follow our hearts what if we dont what if we sit in the quiet and truly listen to gods voice what if we continue to fill our lives with noisy clutter what if we look at others through the eyes of jesus
6645726 in a series of eye movement studies we showed that social experience has an impact on how people look at faces specifically we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features one possible cause of this could be that direct or excessive eye contact may be considered rude in east asian cultures
6645727 by disproving the long held assumption that face processing is universally achieved we have highlighted that the external environment including the society in which we develop is very influential in basic human mechanisms and caution should be taken when generalising findings to the entire human population
6645728 our model suggests that there is a second cell of air in each hemisphere which is characterised by air rising clouds forming storms developing and other processes associated with moisture in the air occurring in the mid latitudes
6645729 with more attention than ever before being focused on understanding our planets climate weather systems and atmosphere its important that scientists challenge their own assumptions and current theories of how these complex processes work i think our study sheds new light on the driving forces behind the weather in the mid latitudes
6645730 we looked at what we could do to address them and the whole area of air quality as it relates to the emission of ammonia from poultry houses
6645731 weve certainly been on a learning curve since 2001 about the different plant materials suitable for this practice we typically recommend the first row nearest the fans to be either a deciduous tree or a tree with a waxy leaf surface and the other two rows be an evergreen
6645732 its very important to realize there are a number of criteria that you use in tree selection and planting design what works for our soil types and climate on the delmarva peninsula may not be suitable for other locations
6645733 one initial concern was that it takes years for trees to grow to become effective in filtering out poultry house emissions but thats not necessarily the case
6645734 planting trees demonstrates that the poultry grower is being proactive to address potential concerns of neighbors gives the poultry farm a landscape appearance and increases property values adding the vegetative buffers also helps to reduce noise associated with farm operations
6645735 the pentagon will be sending 12 000 to 15 000 additional u s troops to afghanistan possibly as soon as the end of this year
6645736 reported examples of the bush administration considering other deceptive schemes to justify or provoke war with iraq such as the reported consideration of painting a u s aircraft with un colors in order to provoke iraq into military confrontation
6645737 there is information that six blackwater guards are to be tried in washington
6645738 the iraqi government stresses that blackwater has committed a crime and the iraqi government retains the right to prosecute the company
6645739 high likelihood the department will seek to indict at least some of them

6645743 aku sudah memikirkannya ayah tahu samson punya rambut yang panjang musa juga punya rambut panjang nuh rambutnya juga panjang bahkan yesus pun rambutnya panjang jadi menurutku saya tidak perlu memotong rambutku
6645744 given the ability of rhodactis sp to rapidly reproduce and completely smother reefs managers are now facing the possibility that even with removal of the ship sheer reproductive capacity of r howesii may continue to fuel its spread along the western reef shelf of palmyra
6645745 leicesters involvement in this major research project is a direct result of our international reputation for research on the analysis of safety critical control software
6645746 future esa missions like the autonomous robotic satellites which will collect and return samples from the surface of mars require control systems involving complex requirements system architectures software algorithms and hardware implementations
6645747 key elements for the development of such autonomous rendezvous control systems are the availability of reliable analysis tools for the verification and validation of complex system behaviour
6645748 in this new project we will develop and test control system analysis techniques to improve the reliability and efficiency of this verification and validation process
6645749 this latest project is the third major research contract we have recently been awarded by esa and confirms that the leicester control group is now at the forefront of european research on space control systems

6645776 in china human rabies was largely under control during the years 1990 1996 via nation wide rabies vaccination programmes since the end of the century however cases of human rabies have jumped high enough to trigger a warning sign for control and prevention
6645777 the use of human and equine rabies immunoglobulins hrig erig has saved the lives of countless patients who would have died if treated with vaccine alone however both products are often in short supply worldwide and are virtually unaffordable in developing countries
6645778 the four rabies endemic provinces lacked strictly enforced measures to eliminate dog rabies or an ample supply of modern cell culture rabies vaccines for humans
6645779 in the worst affected province guandong 62 5 of patients did not receive proper treatment on their wounds 92 5 did not receive adequate post exposure vaccination and 91 25 did not receive any anti rabies immunoglobulin
6645780 wahai orang orang yang beriman diwajibkan berpuasa atas kamu sebagaimana diwajibkan atas orang orang sebelum kamu agar kamu bertaqwa maksud ayat 183 surah al baqarah beberapa hari yang ditentukan itu ialah bulan ramadhan bulan yang padanya diturunkan permulaan al quran sebagai petunjuk dan penjelasan penjelasan mengenai petinjuk itu dan perbezaan antara yang hak dan yang batil kerana itu sesiapa antara kamu hadir dinegeri tempat tinggalnya pada bulan itu maka hendaklah berpuasa pada bulan itu
6645781 mereka sedikit sekali tidur pada waktu malam dan pada akhir akhir malam mereka memohon ampun kepada allah s w t
6645782 sesiapa yang beribadah pada bulan ramadhan dengan penuh keimanan kepada allah s w t dan mengharapkan pahalanya nescaya akan diampunkan dosa dosanya yang telah lalu
6645783 sesungguhnya allah s w t telah mewajibkan puasa ramadhan atas kamu sekelian dan aku mensunnahkan atas kamu agar beribadat pada bulan ramadhan jesteru sesiapa yang berpuasa dan beribadah pada bulan ramadhan dengan penuh keimanan dan mengharapkan pahala maka dosa dosanya yang telah lalu akan diampunkan oleh allah s w t
6645784 telah datang bulan ramadhan yang penuh berkat kepadamu dengannya allah s w t melimpahkan rahmat nya mengampunkan dosa dan mengabulkan doa pada bulan itu allah s w t melihat perlumbaan dalam mengerjakan ibadah dan membangga banggakan kamu dihadapan para malaikat oleh kerana itu tunjukkanlah kepada nya kebaikan kebaikan dirimu maka sesungguhnya orang orang yang celaka adalah mereka yang tidak mendapatkan rahmat allah azza wa jalla pada bulan ramadhan
6645785 sesiapa beribadat pada malam malam bulan ramadhan dengan penuh keimanan dan mengharapkan akan pahala deripada allah s w t nescaya dosa dosanya yang telah lalu akan diampuni oleh allah s w t
6645786 solat tarawih adalah sunnat muakkad orang yang pertama kali mengerjakannya adalah rasulullah s a w hal ini berdasarkan kepada satu hadith yang diriwayatkan oleh abu hurairah yang bermaksud
6645787 sesiapa beribadat pada malam hari bulan ramadhan dengan penuh keimanan kepada allah s w t dan mengarapkan pahala daripada nya nescaya akan diampunkan dosa dosanya yang telah lalu
6645788 sesungguhnya aku melihat apa yang kamu kerjakan dan tidak ada sesuatu apa pun yang mencegah aku untuk keluar mengerjakan solat bersama kamu semua kecuali aku khuatir kalau kalau kamu menganggap solat itu diwajibkan atas kamu
6645789 nabi muhammad s a w keluar kemasjid kebetulan pada malam bulan ramadhan itu para sahabat mengerjakan solat ditepi tepi masjid baginda s a w bertanya siapa mereka itu ada yang menjawab
6645790 saya keluar bersama umar ibnu al khattab pada suatu malam bulan ramadhan kebetulan pada saat itu orang ramai sedang mengerjakan solat secara berjamaah dalam beberapa kelompok ada pula seorang yang bersolat secara bersendirian dan ada pula yang solat keseorangan tetapi kemudian diikuti oleh orang lain sehingga menjadi suatu kumpulan melihat keadaan itu umar berkata saya berpendapat sekiranya mereka ini dihimpunkan dibawah satu imam nescaya ia adalah lebih baik
6645791 sebaik baik bidah adalah ini adapun orang yang tidur pada awal malam seraya bermaksud akan mengerjakan solat lail tarawih pada malam hari yang demikian itu adalah lebih utama daripada orang yang mengerjakannya pada awal malam akan tetapi umat islam mengerjakan pada awal malam
6645792 sesungguhnya nabi muhammad s a w keluar pada waktu tengah malam pada bulan ramadhan kemudian solat dimasjid beberapa orang mengikuti solat baginda rasulullah s a w pada sebelah paginya mereka menceritakan perkara tersebut kepada teman teman mereka
6645793 sehingga nabi muhammad s a w wafat keadaan masih tetap seperti itu
6645794 saya menjumpai umat islam madinah mengerjakan solat tarawih 39 rakaat bersama witirnya tiga rakaat
6645795 pada zaman umar ibnu al khattab r a umat islam mengerjakan solat tarawih dalam bulan ramadhan sebanyak 20 rakaat
6645796 pada zaman umar ibnu al khattab r a orang ramai mengerjakan solat tarawih sebanyak 23 rakaat
6645797 solat pada malam malam bulan ramadhan adalah 20 rakaat ia adalah sunnat muakkad dan orang yang mula mula mengerjakannya adalah nabi muhammad s a w adapun nama tarawih itu dinisbahkan kepada umar ibnu al khattab r a ini kerana umar menghimpun umat islam untuk mengerjakan solat tarawih secara jemaah dibelakang ubai bin kaab yang bertindak sebagai imam
6645798 umat islam pada zaman umar mengerjakan qiyamullail sebanyak 23 rakaat
6645799 seandainya seluruh penduduk madinah mengerjakan 36 rakaat nescaya bilangan rakaat yang dikerjakan oleh umar ibnu al khattab dan telah diijmakan oleh para sahabat yang lain ketika itu lebih utama untuk diikuti kerana sesungguhnya penduduk madinah mengerjakan bilangan rakaat sedemikian itu hanya kerana mereka ingin menyemai amalan penduduk makkah bertawaf tujuh kali setiap selesai dua kali salam empat rakaat oleh sebab itu penduduk madinah menggantikan tujuh kali tawaf tadi dengan empat rakaat namun demikian apa yang telah ditetapkan oleh para sabahat nabi muhammad s a w adalah lebih utama untuk diikuti
6645800 semoga allah s w t menerangi kubur umar sebagaimana dia telah menerangi masjid masjid kami
6645801 seseorang yang menjadi imam solat tarawih hendaklah membaca ayat ayat yang dirasakan dapat meringankan makmumnya dan bukan yang memberat beratkan mereka jadi bacaan ayat ayatnya adalah yang meringankan bagi makmumnya
6645802 bahawa solat tarawih itu 20 rakaat dilaksanakn selepas solat isyak dan salam setiap dua rakaat selain witir didalam tarawih itu disunnatkan dikerjakan dirumah jika masjid telah penuh dengan jamaah yang mendirikan solat tarawih akan tetapi jika amsjid kosong daripada solat tarawih maka yang lebih utama adalah masjid dengan berjamaah
6645803 sungguh benar adanya daripada ubai bin kaab bahawa beliau solat tarawih dengan 20 rakaat bersama umat islam tanpa ada perselisihan antara para sahabat
6645804 majoriti ahli ilmu mengerjakan solat tarawih berdasarkan kepada riwayat daripada umar ali dan sahabat sahabat nabi muhammad s
6645805 aku menjumpai umat islam dinegeri aku makkah mengerjakan solat tarawih 20 rakaat
6645806 imam malik dalam satu riwayat mengatakan imam abu hanifah imam dan imam ahmad memilih 20 rakaat selain witir
6645807 mazhab kami menetapkan bahawa solat tarawih berjumlah 20 rakaat dengan sepuluh salam selain witir
6645808 solat tarawih terdiri daripada 9 tarwihat istirahat yang jumlahnya 36 rakaat selain witir
6645809 hujah mazhab kami berdasarkan keterangan yang diriwayatkan oleh imam al baihaqi dengan sanadnya yang sohih daripada al saib bin yazid al sahabi r a beliau berkata umat i slam pada zaman khalifah umar ibnu al khattab mengerjakan solat tarawih 20 rakaat dalam bulan ramadhan sedangkan pada zaman khalifah usman mereka mengerjakannya 200 dua ratus rakaat sehingga mereka bersandar pada tongkat tongkat mereka kerana terlalu letihnya berdiri
6645810 umat islam pada zaman khalifah umar ibnu al khattab r a mengerjakan qiyam ramadhan dengan solat 23 rakaat tarawih dan witir
6645811 benar bahawa ubai bin kaab mengerjakan solat pada bulan ramadhan bersama umat islam sebanyak 20 rakaat dan witir tiga rakaat jadi para ulama berpendapat bahawa yang demikian itu ditengah tengah para sahabat muhajirin dan para sahabat ansar dan tidak ada seorang pun yang mengingkarinya menentangnya
6645812 majmuah al fatawa al najdiyah disebut bahawa sheikh abdullah bin abdul wahhab memberikan jawapan tentang bilangan rakaat tarawih
6645813 sesungguhnya rumah yang mula mula dibangun untuk tempat beribadah bagi manusia ialah baitullah dibakkah makkah yang diberkati dan menjadi petunjuk bagi semua manusia
6645814 sesungguhnya masjid yang didirikan atas dasar takwa sejak hari pertama adalah lebih patut kamu mengerjakan solat didalamnya didalamnya ada orang orang yang membersihkan diri dan allah menyukai orang orang yang suci
6645815 if you want to know why something happened to you hold up the belief that you do know why it is important to learn forgiveness because every time you replay a negative memory making yourself wrong you are creating it again in the future in moments of crisis a new self is often born a baby itself one that has just come into being with the crisis like a small child it may not have the skills to handle things perfectly or beautifully and yet that self is growing every moment it is not a gift to this new being if you go back and send it images of its wrongness

6645878 last i saw her she was by ben who should still be sleeping but knowing ben he probably snuck out of the house while everyone was sleeping to train or he headed to the magos hq by himself
6645879 but if that happened then hellia or ashley chan would have come and informed us
6645880 that would be a good thing but she could have just followed him or even help him get out of the house as well
6645881 well we could always summon tracker snakes they can fly but they need a scent to follow
6645882 is it possible for you people with hands and thumbs to get two plates for our masters ben is slightly awake but still drowsy thats why im drowsy
6645883 i wonder how brother will eat when he is drowsy i mean when hes sleepy hes pretty much useless
6645884 thats how it is with most people but more true for bear blade users we need to have our strength for a lot of techniques and if we are sleepy we cant summon all our strength for attacks or focus our ki and mana for spells
6645885 that blade just now he looked like me why is that
6645886 thats because i used you to make a caste for bens sword you were asleep at the time so you wouldnt remember
6645887 that would explain why brother was so impatient with me for not having my caste for coatl so fast master ake had to specially make the caste for him and after coatl was finished we broke the mold
6645888 i think i can answer your question about how bennii chan will eat ill show you
6645889 thats what would happen ashley nee san will feed bennii chan
6645890 or he could be stubborn and hurt himself eating that would be a sight to see someone hurting themself for food
6645891 poor brother reaper he is cursed to be linked sir ben who would have thought that sir ben would curse his own blade
6645892 thats just how it is with bear blade users its a tradition when you make your sword while the blade is redhot you place a drop of blood on the tip one on each side of the blade and two at the base where the blade will meet the hilt that way unless the master passes the technique on no one will be able to learn the masters technique justin reaper and myself are cursed as you put it
6645893 well be back were just checking on brother and nee san
6645894 that boy is trent right and those girls are ninja right and if they have kids they are going to be freaking powerful kids and if their children master all three energies they will be stronger then anything this world has seen

6645990 with our technology we can image specific cells in real time with exquisite selectivity which allows us to track their location and movement and to count the apparent number of cells present we then use conventional mri to obtain a high resolution image that places the labeled cells in their anatomical context
6645991 the large background signal from mobile water and intrinsic tissue contrast differences can often make it challenging to unambiguously identify regions containing these metal ion labeled cells throughout the body which is the current state of the art
6645992 right now were using our technology to image key cell types involved in autoimmune diseases like type i diabetes but our cellular mri agents also can be adapted to label other cell types including cells from bone marrow and stem cells a key long term application of our technology is to label and monitor cell based therapeutics in humans
6645993 ideally we would label therapeutic cells with our cellular mri agents before they are implanted into a patient in this way we could use mri to visualize the movement of the therapeutic cells in the patient to monitor whether they migrate to and remain in the desired tissues
6645994 a very powerful flashlight directed at the moon would theoretically create a bright spot on its surface by simply turning the flashlight sideways the flashlights beam streaks across the sky at speeds far exceeding the speed of light this evidence has long been known and dismissed since the bright spot cannot be used for superluminal or faster than light communication between the earth and the moon the fast motion of the bright spot is simply a geometrical artifact similar in some ways to the point at which the two blades of closing scissors intersect the theory of relativity does not concern such purely geometrical objects

6646167 are you going to give us someone who will cause us to want to stay home
6646168 at least according to the polling data we are doing very well with our base
6646169 giving a head fake that youre going to pick somebody thats pro choice if you werent actually planning on doing it
6646170 keeping an equal focus on john mccain and who he might pick as his vp is a good way to keep john mccain in the news
6646171 tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice
6646172 and i dont think that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
6646173 as president of the united states i will be a pro life president
6646174 we are literally imploring you to not turn your back on your great pro life record over decades now
6646175 if john mccain were behind by the generic ballot preference for a democrat by say a dozen points then thered be far more incentive for an out of the box pick
6646176 if xbox live were a state it would rank as the countrys seventh largest giving it approximately 20 electoral votes
6646177 thats the job the coaches have entrusted me to do so im definitely ready

6646181 going down to clemson and doing what he did in front of i dont know how many people theyve got there shows hes obviously mentally tough
6646182 spiller got me on that one that was one of those plays where i had to learn quick and put it out of my mind
6646183 i was grateful for defensive coordinator frank spaziani because he helped me out a lot on the next play he was telling me that that happens and you just have to go back in and play i didnt dwell on it as much as i probably would have being young and a first year starter it helped a lot just knowing i just have to move onto the next play
6646184 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6646185 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6646186 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6646187 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6646188 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6646189 the greens are good i mean theyre perfect perfect speed

6646208 hoy por este jueves es un d a malo para la educaci n porque a pesar de que hicimos un ofrecimiento a los docentes tratando que en la urgencia les llegue al bolsillo un 7 por ciento m s que se suma al 24 por ciento que otorgamos hace cinco meses los gremios no lo han aceptado
6646209 porque no reconocen el esfuerzo que est haciendo la provincia ni que dimos un 24 por ciento de aumento en marzo
6646210 hace cinco meses hicimos paritarias y volvemos a hacerlas ahora
6646211 les ofrecimos un incremento del 7 por ciento para que en la urgencia llegue al bolsillo de los docentes en septiembre para volver a juntarnos en octubre y all volver a hablar de la estructura salarial
6646212 pedidos que ellos hicieron de presupuesto en capacitaci n cargos infraestructura y equipamiento no puede ser que siempre sea insuficiente o creer que el paro es una fuerza que obligue a la provincia a comprometerse en una inversi n que no puede hacer
6646213 espero apoyo y ayuda de los dirigentes gremiales para encontrar una soluci n a n cuando no sea la m s deseada pero una soluci n posible porque no es pele ndonos con los gremios como se va a mejorar la educaci n la educaci n tiene sentido cuando los chicos van a la escuela y aprenden
6646214 que sigan conversando y explorando las distintas alternativas dentro de los equilibrios
6646215 muchas veces hay que elegir entre lo ideal y lo posible la educaci n es un tema central y todos saben cu nto invirti la provincia en esa rea
6646216 s que todos merecen ganar m s y trabajamos para que eso pueda ocurrir y en este marco de conversaciones ojal que podamos avanzar yo trabajo para que en la provincia todos avancen y nadie quede atr s
6646217 es otra muestra de la convicci n de los docentes
6646218 existe una disconformidad manifiesta con la falta de una propuesta oficial que satisfaga el justo reclamo del sector
6646219 desde las bases se est pidiendo la continuidad del plan de lucha si el gobierno contin a en la postura de no dar respuesta a las demandas de los docentes
6646220 hoy los tiempos de negociaci n los establecen las mismas necesidades de los docentes porque no se puede estirar la negociaci n porque el salario de los trabajadores se va depreciando d a a d a
6646221 para evaluar la continuidad del plan de lucha y su eventual profundizaci n si el gobierno no mejora la oferta salarial del 7
6646222 existen matafuegos dentro de la sala donde se realiza el juicio as como tambi n personal de bomberos
6646223 la sala ha sido inspeccionada recientemente por personal id neo en la materia certific ndose que re ne las condiciones de seguridad necesarias
6646224 hay instalados en los otros sectores del edificio bombas hidrantes y tanto dentro como fuera de la sala hay personal de seguridad debidamente entrenado para orientar al p blico presente en caso de necesidad de realizar una evacuaci n de emergencia
6646225 i am your nightmare i am the shape in the dark
6646226 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
6646227 you bastards can say whatever you want but only jesus saves
6646228 come all you that labor and receive my grace and favor they that feel no pain nor ill need no physicians help nor skill
6646229 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
6646230 the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6646231 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6646232 words in that draft led some to misconstrue the departments intent
6646233 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience
6646234 this regulation does not seek to resolve any ambiguity in that area it focuses on abortion and focuses on physicians conscience in relation to that
6646235 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity
6646236 we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important
6646237 there is nothing in this rule that would in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
6646238 participating in any activity with a reasonable connection to the objectionable procedure including referrals training and other arrangements for offending procedures
6646239 what about delivering mail through blizzards and the dark of night and all that
6646240 but what about delivering mail through blizzards and the dark of night and all that the post office takes a lot of pride in that and i was surprised to learn they can be scared off by what they thought was a bunch of bees
6646241 she said i knew you would come by here eventually
6646242 im a little teed off this can be disruptive especially when no one tells you i am in the phone book
6646243 its our policy to notify the customer when service is suspended and i must apologize on behalf of the postal service that that was not done in this case

6646251 what is amazing this year is how many people have bought the fundamentally childish notion that if you dont like the way things are going the answer is to write a blank check for generic change empowering someone chosen not on the basis of any track record but on the basis of his skill with words
6646252 barack obama concedes that americas troops have contributed to improvements on the ground in iraq but he still stands by his vote against the surge why not just admit that he was wrong obama has fallen to pride in part because he has bought his own myth by staking his future on a past of supernatural vision he has made it difficult to admit human fault the magic isnt working anymore and obama the visionary one cant even see what everyone else sees he was wrong
6646253 sen obama owes it to the public to let us know how much of our hard earned money he in his wisdom believes we have a moral obligation to give away to poor people around the world and how much of our money that he has a moral obligation to extract from our wages forcefully through federal taxation
6646254 obama is a three year senator without a single important legislative achievement to his name a former illinois state senator who voted present nearly 130 times as president of the harvard law review as law professor and as legislator has he ever produced a single notable piece of scholarship written a single memorable article his most memorable work is a biography of his favorite subject himself
6646255 barack obama finally played the palace or at least the tiergarten and he left a lot of promises in his wake hell get christians muslims and jews to hit the sawdust trail together to repent their sins and suspicions and remake the world hell tear down walls between nations between races tribes and immigrants between east and west between the haves and the have nots and with his spare change hell buy the world a coke
6646256 were trying to stop the drug companies killing your children
6646257 perhaps they should look at corticosteroids and life support systems for premature babies developed in rabbits and monkeys respectively or the meningitis vaccine mice and asthma treatments rabbits that both continue to help millions of children worldwide
6646258 the parade was a couple of kids pulling a wagon down the street and now its grown into a big event that brings in thousands of people
6646259 we have the highest quality lentils and some of the most fertile land in the country which is perfect for growing crops
6646260 the ioc has therefore asked the international gymnastics federation to endeavor to find out more we understand they are doing so immediately
6646261 every day i wish the phone rang and they said we made a mistake
6646262 after a long and sleepless night i have determined you are not a good fit and not what we want
6646263 might be unable to maintain high level contacts in the military intelligence community
6646264 an er visit for something thats not an emergency costs the medical center 1 200
6646265 thats sucking up dollars in health care that we dont all have to just blow through carelessly
6646266 michelle inspired us to step back and take a holistic approach to this problem
6646267 i wasnt expecting to go up given our resource constraints
6646268 we pay attention to them primarily because our parents do and some of our perspective students do
6646269 in fairness to the university of florida theyre already doing a darn good job
6646270 i dont want to make too much of it but i think it would be a mistake to ignore

6646275 from what i can see republicans dont think it would be a good idea
6646276 nobody ever votes for the vice president her or she is there to step in in the event that something happens to the president
6646277 well lit streets parking lots and walkways are in everyones best interest common sense argues however that the best way to achieve good lighting is by directing light toward the ground and not toward the sky
6646278 we have not gotten any good news from the state
6646279 i want to appeal to the three of you who have voted to fund a salary compensation study this year or next year at the expense of all of the other county employees i am against that what you are doing is that no other county employee will get a raise i think public safety is important but you have put public safety above everyone else
6646280 all of your employees have insurance costs that are going up gru is raising rates every two minutes gas bills are going up you have chosen not to help those individuals at all to implement a salary study that we cannot afford
6646281 this is about bringing our staff up to market the bottom line is for our employees to get paid what they should be paid just to bring them up to market
6646282 i dont get this constant changing of the playing field every time i come before the board
6646283 i want to find out what the numbers are and what they mean its so much bigger than 129 000 now
6646284 the final vote right now is not to go with the salary study and my vote is not to allocate any money from the municipal services fund balance either the information i got today concerns me a little bit more if we had not had this big number jump out at us i was going to support it
6646285 d uring a recent stay with a palestinian family in the west bank i found myself in their basement watching the news with two of my hosts sons
6646286 palestine calls to you support me liberate me i am your mother and you are my sons
6646287 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6646288 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6646289 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6646290 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6646291 there is no legal basis for keeping my client behind bars his arrest is in violation of all palestinian laws
6646292 no security agency has the right to question interrogate or detain a palestinian journalist on matters pertaining to his or her work
6646293 i dont know of any journalist being arrested in gaza a journalist working for a german television network was detained recently for a few days in connection with the violence that struck the gaza beach in june but he has been released
6646294 sa vedeti ce e martea cand e zi de gunoi coboara ursii pana pe strazile din oras si rascolesc prin pubele ti e frica si sa iesi din casa
6646295 in fapt spune primarul vlad oprea situatia e greu de tinut sub control ei sunt foarte multi si nu le mai place mancarea pe care o gasesc in padure s au obisnuit sa primeasca de la turisti he he he acum cateva seri a intrat unul chiar in restaurant in urma cu doua luni am luat o hotarare de consiliu ca sa i amendam pe cei care hranesc ursii sau care ii ademenesc pentru filmare si fotografiere cei care au abilitatea de a aplica amenzile cuprinse intre 500 si 1 500 ron sunt politistii politistii comunitari si jandarmii noi incercam sa aplicam aceasta hotarare dar va dati seama nu poti sa controlezi tot muntele in plus patrularea pe strazi pot s o faca doar politistii si jandarmii
6646296 au fost initiate programe de relocare sau indepartare in colaborare cu romsilva garda de mediu de impuscat nu se pune problema conform raspunsului pe care l am primit de la ministerul mediului pentru ca se afla in parcul national bucegi si sunt protejati dupa doi ani de demersuri asidue abia am primit aviz de la mediu pentru indepartarea a 14 ursi desi noi am cerut pentru 27 o alta problema e ca pot fi relocati in zone salbatice doar ursii tineri pana in doi ani si jumatate pentru ceilalti solutia ar fi sa se faca special pentru ei o rezervatie dar este foarte scump nu pot fi dusi nici in rezervatia de la plaiul foii zarnesti pentru infiintarea careia societatea mondiala de protectie a animalelor din londra a cheltuit 2 milioane de euro fonduri bugetare pentru ca acolo sunt ursi care au trait doar in captivitate iar cei salbatici i ar omori
6646297 in primul rand ca nu este doar treaba primariei noi ne am limitat ca in prima faza sa monitorizam toti ursii am trimis aceasta monitorizare la ministerul mediului si am primit aviz pe fiecare urs in parte adica 12 pentru relocare si doua pentru impuscare cei de la ocolul silvic vor monta panouri care ii avertizeaza pe turisti iar in rest e treaba ministerului mediului sa se ocupe de relocare
6646298 politia nu are nici o atributiune cand este vorba despre ursi nici nu aplica sanctiuni dar la nivelul primariei s a constituit un comandament in acest scop
6646299 nu cunosc motivul dar nu mai exista nici un comandament in primarie cel putin de doua saptamani
6646300 comandamentul a fost mai curand virtual in sensul ca s au reunit primaria asociatia de protectie a mediului un ong care a pus la dispozitie masina de patrulare ajvps inspectoratul de vanatoare politia comunitara politia nationala jandarmeria si ministerul mediului dar tot ce s a stabilit a fost la nivel de discutii nu exista nimic scris iar sarcinile erau repartizate cam asa primaria captureaza ursii si ii duce la gradina zoologica icas transfera puii in harghita ong ul castreaza ursii mai mari lucru care nu s a intamplat niciodata cele doua politii nu lasa oamenii sa se apropie de ursi garda de mediu da amenzile iar primaria mai avea in sarcina producerea si amplasarea panourilor care avertizau turistii sa nu se apropie de ursi si amenzile ce se pot aplica
6646301 degeaba erau golite containerele spune ramon jurj oamenii atat localnici cat si turisti aduceau gunoiul dupa ce treceau masinile de salubritate adica de la 9 pana pe la 11 noaptea ursii s au adaptat si si au facut programul de masa dupa cel al firmei
6646302 gardienii romania refuza sa primeasca gunoiul bulgar cel putin pana in 2015 romania nu se poate incarca cu deseurile altor state si poate refuza deseurile acestora chiar daca sunt membre ale uniunii europene pana in anul 2015 a declarat joi ministrul mediului romania este una din rile unde ar putea fi depozitate de eurile din capitala bulgar sofia a declarat adjunctul ministrului bulgar al mediului i apelor ceavdar georgiev intr un interviu acordat postului hunedoara

6646305 romania inca nu si a rezolvat problemele in domeniul deseurilor ca sa si permita sa le rezolve pe ale altora oricum noi avem dreptul conform negocierilor de aderare sa refuzam orice categorie de deseuri municipale

6646308 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6646309 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6646310 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6646311 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6646312 fundamentally it is a reaction to widespread passenger aversion to the idea of many people talking loudly on flights as weve all often experienced before take off or while landing
6646313 we recognize the fact the trajectory of our traffic in our business is unacceptable
6646314 we are doing work behind the scenes and we are getting ourselves ready to play more offensively minded when it comes to getting traffic through the front doors

6646319 all three reports tend to indicate that were bottoming out but that there is no real end in sight and thats what i think the market has to get used to
6646320 la ora actuala eu nu stiu de un document care sa fi venit din partea bulgariei dar daca vine desigur o sa i explicam si partii bulgare decizia noastra cand vom fi contactati oficial le spunem clar ca romania nu poate si trebuie sa inteleaga si ei de ce pentru ca trebuie sa ne gospodarim cu deseurile noastre trebuie sa reconstruim tot sistemul romanesc si pana cand nu se termina lucrul acesta nu avem cum sa primim alte deseuri din alte state
6646321 tratatul de aderare ne permite lucrul acesta cum probabil ca permite si bulgariei dar nu cunosc acest lucru noua ne permite ca pana in 2015 sa respingem primirea deseurilor municipale din alte tari din ue

6646323 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet
6646324 that was really the only suspicious thing about the letter and our national headquarters advised out of an abundance of caution for our staff and volunteers that we have the authorities check it out

6646329 nothing else good that was going on could receive any attention because of that issue
6646330 some investors have not been happy with the way that diller has managed the company and so they might be more open to looking at the pieces hes no longer associated with
6646331 this festival is to offer prayers to mansha devi for six months we pray to mansha devi and for the other six months we pray to devi durga debadini mela is held during which we pray to goddess mansha to appreciate her strength and seek blessings
6646332 there was a time when it did not rain we offered prayers and it rained since then we have started this festival
6646333 we pray to god that there should be adequate rains this year that is why we take out these bhujerias
6646334 all the 40 restaurants that participated were green which is special since green restaurants are still in a minority
6646335 but these two stood out head and shoulders above the rest for doing so many things that were completely voluntary and self motivated
6646336 no lo conozco pero escuch que rudy ulloa el choferata de kirchner anda con 100 palos verdes y lo quiere comprar
6646337 se comete un grave error cuando se piensa que internet es solamente una tecnolog a se trata de una forma de comunicaci n crecientemente central y que requiere incorporarse a las pol ticas culturales y educativas
6646338 what i see are wet spots on the floor where the exposed concrete wall and floor meet and behind the plastic barrier the insulation is wet we thought it was a foundation problem but have since been told its condensation but i thought insulation was supposed to stop condensation
6646339 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6646340 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6646341 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6646342 officers found that the child did have two black eyes severe swelling about the head marks on his back from extension cords and belts he had bruising all over
6646343 thank goodness for the harvest foods employees if it had not been for them this child could have died
6646344 he would never allow somebody to hurt any child theyre trying to make my child out to be a monster theyre trying to set him up
6646345 after the swelling went away he bumped his head inside the house on the door facing is what she told me twice in the same place
6646346 we didnt take him to the doctor because he didnt show any signs of trauma he appeared to me to be okay
6646347 when you see a 2 year old child severely injured by 2 adults in the name of discipline its really disturbing
6646348 lu i was going to say you wearing that eye patch was a bonus but i think its more like a raise
6646349 it appears to be a memo this is from all the vps at uca
6646350 i like this type of situation and its literally fun to have the barbs and the comebacks
6646351 its great to see everyone just coming out of surgery and healing this probably does more for the healing process than anything
6646352 what are you doing in gaza have you been to israel before do you speak russian do you have a driving license how many passports do you have whats your boss called
6646353 israel has refused transit to more sick palestinians seeking treatment since hamas took control of the strip and several of them die unnecessarily every month
6646354 despite the agreement between hamas and israel there has been no improvement towards patients in gaza in israeli policy which seems even to have become worse to the obstacles imposed by the general security service on people who want to leave gaza for medical treatment patients face more bureaucratic difficulties imposed by the army which prevent them enjoying their right to health
6646355 unrwa receives barely 56 of the resources it needs to look after the refugees it supplies 60 of their daily diet which does not meet western recommendations on personal nutrition
6646356 i have invited solana and blair to visit gaza and get to know personally the situation of the refugees but they have declined the invitation
6646357 the issue is one of justice not of distributing food parcels and medicines to people in need without a system by which israel is held to account for its actions justice does not exist
6646358 israeli policies are designed to limit the number of palestinians living in areas earmarked for settlements or in their vicinity
6646359 the israeli authorities have for many years applied a discriminatory policy of house demolitions permitting on the one hand many tens of israeli settlements to be built on occupied palestinian territory in flagrant violation of international law at the same time as they confiscate palestinian lands forbidding the palestinian population to build and destroying their houses the cleared land is often used to build illegal israeli settlements international law prohibits occupying powers from building settlements for their own citizens on the territories they occupy
6646360 in his 1965 autobiography edward bernays recalls a dinner at his home in 1933 where karl von weigand foreign correspondent of the hearst newspapers an old hand at interpreting europe and just returned from germany was telling us about goebbels and his propaganda plans to consolidate nazi power
6646361 you can use yellow as a bridge from the cooler colours of summer to the warmer colours of fall

6646363 no lo conozco pero escuch que rudy ulloa el choferata de kirchner anda con 100 palos verdes y lo quiere comprar
6646364 we didnt design just a single house instead we designed a housing system we did that because one house is not going to save the world no matter how good it is but if we thought about the nature of manufacturing and construction from first principles we could design housing prototypes that are flexible and adaptable if youre not designing housing in this way its unsustainable using the fabrication processes the airplane industry has been using for years you can have precisely controlled building components that can be highly efficient and rapidly assembled
6646365 instead of trying to reduce the amount of glass to reduce energy loss in a house we should look for advanced glazing technology to deliver more natural light for a healthier more luxurious lifestyle we may not know where russian or canadian society is going but i can tell you people want more amenities more freedom and more choice if we deliver that luxury and amenity we can have an exponential growth in long term sustainability
6646366 its got rectilinear geometries because of their enormous efficiency but its also got very clean lines lots of natural light and openness to nature space efficient planning weve tried to take some sustainable features such as the louvre system which modulates sunlight and make it a beautiful rhythmic touch on the facade
6646367 its a better use of land and infrastructural resources that kind of density allows community gardens and community services to happen efficiently along with things like shared geothermal networks
6646368 ive done things this year that i havent done in 10 years
6646369 sellers are thinking last year buyers are thinking next year
6646370 the challenge for many sellers is determining the right price for todays market conditions
6646371 i say to them wow im not sure thats going to happen
6646372 ive actually turned down more listings this year than ive ever done because sellers are way up there
6646373 i just dont need my for sale sign on the lawn if it doesnt sell
6646374 once kids are back in school the buyers are out people love coming out in the fall
6646375 along with the original tin ceiling in the dining room they are in a state as fine as the day they were installed
6646376 it prevents them from being able to live in a new space really functionally and have it aesthetically pleasing as well
6646377 what you have to do is just look at it from the other tack and say what will this space hold
6646378 then from that you go into your own home and you start shopping your home
6646379 if you look at it that way its sort of an opportunity to help others to perhaps buy yourself new things with the sale of your old and to start living in your new smaller space with just the right amount of things in it so that its a pleasant place to come home to
6646380 it prevents you from having to stack things on top of each other that way everything is very easily accessible
6646381 anything that you can put on the wall to free up floor space will help make your room feel bigger whether its open shelving or hooks on the wall
6646382 if theyre positioned in such a way that they reflect light from a window or that they reflect something beautiful to make the room look like its larger than it is that will help
6646383 it can be a nice cream shade pale yellows pale blues pale greens
6646384 sometimes painting the ceiling in the same tone as the wall can help too because with a stark white ceiling your eye is drawn to it and it immediately shows that theres just the small space
6646385 ah well we all wanted to live here because of the view of the city
6646386 a relative of mine said to me after we moved here whats it like living in the slums
6646387 there was a real excitement around being here and being downtown
6646388 i remember how wonderful it was to walk to yonge and st clair where there was action and to wonderful ravines over at the end of woodlawn
6646389 dis maman tu navais pas dit que marcher le long dun bisse serait facile et tout plat
6646390 im african american and it would be nice to see an african american for president
6646391 just because a guys black doesnt mean he knows what hes doing
6646392 a lot of christian folks they dont believe in that stuff
6646393 he seems to be a person who can deal with people across the aisle and compromise his whole demeanor i like that about him
6646394 but when you start digging theres not much below the surface other than what youve been hearing the last 30 years
6646395 the vice presidential selection will play a big role along with the debates
6646396 whenever i see him talking hes making full eye contact hes not evasive he seems closer to genuine
6646397 i think mccain will do something more than what bush has done
6646398 do you really believe theres going to be a victory i still feel hes going to do something to help those boys get back
6646399 when a triggering agent such as a volatile anesthetic is introduced into an mh susceptible persons body increased temperature and muscle rigidity can occur leading to muscle damage and release of ions and proteins into the blood
6646400 this can result in the death of the patient due to an irregular heart beat or kidney failure after the surgical procedure
6646401 proving the causative role of a new mutation enables researchers to include it in the list of mh mutations and makes the genetic test more reliable
6646402 this is an important step toward establishing an inexpensive and minimally invasive genetic test for diagnosing mh this new mutation should therefore be included in the current list of mh causing mutations

6646404 information from this study could be the beginning of a systematic approach to develop a method of predicting pain threshold and morphine requirement for pain relief
6646405 it could also be inferred that the greater analgesic sensitivity to morphine in the aa group is also related to a higher risk of developing nausea
6646406 teksten verzinnen om mensen aan het lachen te maken iets leuker om doen kan ik niet bedenken
6646407 mijn comeback op de planken bewaar ik misschien wel voor mijn tachtigste levensjaar
6646408 momenteel ben ik weer helemaal smoor op de televisiecamera vroeger combineerde ik alles televisie en radiowerk theater dat wil ik niet meer
6646409 met een beetje geluk krijgen we volgende week droog en zonnig weer en temperaturen tot 25 graden
6646410 we halen geen 20 graden en dat is te koud voor de tijd van het jaar
6646411 de bovenluchten zijn z r koud op 5 km hoogte bedraagt de temperatuur amper 25 graden er is dus een groot verticaal contrast wat maakt dat er stevige buien kunnen vallen met zelfs onweer we krijgen een koude heldere nacht en zaterdagochtend is zonnig maar ook nog heel fris met temperaturen beneden de 10 graden
6646412 in de loop van de dag winnen de stapelwolken het van de zon we halen niet meer dan 20 graden het blijft overwegend droog maar plaatselijke buien zijn niet uit te sluiten ook zondag start zonnig na de middag bewolkt het in het binnenland zal het droog blijven voor de kust voorspel ik een weinig regen
6646413 85 procent van de modellen voorspellen voor maandag tot vrijdag overwegend droog weer met geregeld zon en temperaturen van 23 24 graden in de kempen tot 25 graden
6646414 vorig jaar was de zomer ook slecht maar toen viel de minderverkoop nog goed mee
6646415 mensen refereerden aan de zomer voordien en kochten nog massaal een zwembad dit jaar is de zomer van 2007 een ijkpunt en aangezien die niet veel soeps was merken we dit jaar dat de verkoop met 20 gedaald is het fenomeen dat daarvan een gevolg is warmtepompen en zonnepanelen worden dit jaar w l goed verkocht
6646416 de mensen die nu met dat zwembad opgescheept zitten willen er toch nog iets plezier uithalen en dat kan alleen door het water goed te verwarmen
6646417 dat zijn mensen die ooit in een impuls een opblaasbaar of ander goedkoop zwembad hebben gekocht en na een tijd dan toch een echt zwembad willen laten ingraven die mensen zien nu met het slechte weer en de hoge energieprijzen van hun aankoop af bij de hogere klasse is er geen daling die laat nog even vaak met de villa mee een zwembad bouwen en de rijkere vroeg gepensioneerden kiezen voor hele wellnesscomplexen met zwembad poolhouse jacuzzi n sauna
6646418 een paar jaar nu al geven we over heel vlaanderen seminaries zelf een zwembad bouwen en die zijn een succes
6646419 een zwembad dat normaal 25 000 euro kost kun je als je het zelf plaatst voor 10 000 tot 15 000 euro hebben
6646420 maar lasgo is m jn kindje en omdat er zoveel aanvragen binnenkwamen zijn we terug van start gegaan met jelle
6646421 vooral door haar mooie stem is ze de perfecte keuze we willen niet dat ze zomaar de nieuwe evi wordt jelle moet haar eigenheid bewaren
6646422 vroeger speelde ik met barbie nu mag ik zelf barbie zijn ik vind het vooral leuk dat we lekker kunnen overdrijven
6646423 wel gek dat ik nu zelf de liedjes zing waar ik een paar jaar geleden naar luisterde
6646424 ik besef het allemaal nog niet zo goed maar dat zal wel komen als ik een paar keer voor een groot publiek heb gestaan lacht ik m est gewoon zangeres worden iets anders zie ik mij niet doen
6646425 we hebben een contract getekend met een platenfirma in amerika en ook londen is ge nteresseerd
6646426 natuurlijk beginnen er ook aanvragen binnen te lopen voor optredens in het binnenland op 3 september zijn we te zien in tien om te zien op vtm en drie dagen later staat jelle voor haar eerste showcase op het podium in destelbergen
6646427 i dont think we should expect a transformational change in the next few years as i said it may take a generation or two generations or three generations
6646428 but i believe as long as we can improve in our behaviours and our courtesy bit by bit each day i think thats good enough
6646429 hemos pedido a la federaci n de gimnasia revisar esto m s a fondo
6646430 si existe una duda y nos preocupa pedimos a la respectiva federaci n que investigue
6646431 no estamos en posici n de decir si es bueno o no es bueno se trata de un documento de gobierno

6646440 kashmir a cradle of kashmiri shaivism one of the most important threads of hindu civilization is today the tragic playground of separatist islamist leaders and craven politicians
6646441 indian citizens are being denied ownership of land in their own nation and the calls to divide indian territory could have repercussions far beyond jammu and kashmir
6646442 the allegations made by kashmiri separatists that the transfer of land is an attempt to create hindu settlements in kashmir and change the religious demography are as ironic as they are outrageous
6646443 the religious demography in the state was already altered in 1989 when more than 350 000 kashmiri hindus the original inhabitants of the kashmir valley were ethnically cleansed from their ancestral homeland these hindus and all indians must have the right to live and work wherever they wish in their country and the land must be returned to the shrine administrators
6646444 indias true potential as a pluralistic democracy can only be realized when all its people live under uniform laws and no state enjoys special privileges that exclude others
6646445 we call on the government in the indian state of jammu and kashmir to immediately reinstate the land transfer order to the shri amarnath shrine board and take all necessary steps to ensure the protection of the hindu minority in the state
6646446 to be present one must always live a balanced lifestyle listen to your body let yourself daydream have fun sweat pay attention to your social sexual and spiritual being
6646447 it took him a day to jump right back out there
6646448 down the road hes going to be a big factor for us
6646449 yeah and people are helping me up and then i realize i re pulled my ass muscle that just started to feel better from falling off the horse which i will blog about later i am waiting for some pics from karly
6646450 with usain in it its going to be an awesome race
6646451 he set the bar so high now everyone wants a gold medal
6646452 im very excited about the first day that our new iphone application has been live
6646453 long clean walnut bureau with mirror that is in good condition

6646455 man do the blue jays ever need another mediocre utility infielder
6646456 dude why are you hanging with her you use to talk so much smack on her amp now your hanging with her again some best friend
6646457 because you did amp its b s how you do that and go hangout with her the next day
6646458 first of all we made up and that was quite along time ago and you do it too
6646459 well its b s and ridiculous and actually i dont do that
6646460 im going to let you go fishing all day and not ask for a thing
6646461 il faudrait compl tement revoir cette notion damis en lui injectant une couche dintelligence
6646462 that game today is leaving people now scratching their heads about her
6646463 if it wasnt for her there would have definitely been some goals in the back of the net
6646464 vindicated no i dont even think about whatever i said last year im just enjoying this moment right now
6646465 this medal has nothing to do with whether or not healing had taken place healing had to take place in my own heart and own mind to even get this far
6646466 with that said with this gold medal i feel on top of my world
6646467 brazil had control in fact all the time in this game
6646468 we were attacked and attacked and attacked for 110 minutes basically
6646469 she came through in the end which is just true carli lloyd
6646470 her number one thing was always just her own drive shed always be in the yard doing drills back and forth on her own she was self motivated
6646471 she was constantly making the players around her better you could see in her eyes her desire to always improve
6646472 now that hes here we can get the ball rolling and add some more fire to the offense
6646473 every one of the running backs gave the coaches a better look at what we all can do
6646474 but i think if i can continue to play in the manner that i have in the previous four years and stay healthy on the field i think all will be forgiven
6646475 a lot of time were hard on our loved ones and i consider my fans my loved ones so some things i should take back and i do apologize for my statements for being a little critical of them
6646476 but i do want them to be in the stands too
6646477 when youre talking about this kind of money a lot of people cant really understand why you can turn your back on a contract business is business
6646478 this was one of our priorities for the offseason to get an extension for steven jackson
6646479 we believe his skills as a running back and a receiver and his age 25 really make him one of the elite backs in the league were excited for our fans to be able to see a player of this caliber
6646480 a critical piece of getting this done was jay zygmunts professional approach in handling what could have been a very difficult negotiation
6646481 that enabled us to trust one another and that enabled us to break the stalemate
6646482 it couldnt be just window dressing to get him in
6646483 i think both parties did a great job of being respectful of one another
6646484 no one came out and was dirty publicly like some teams have been towards other players
6646485 i dont think there are any more expectations than the 2 500 yards i predicted last year
6646486 im anticipating to come out play hard and run block and catch just be a football player thats what i am at the end of the day
6646487 i just hope to lead my team to a playoff berth
6646488 catchers are much smarter than that tools of ignorance thing but i dont know if were the smartest managers
6646489 obviously youre involved in the offense but youre involved in the pitching how youre going to get people out how they swing the bat you get to see how the bullpens are used
6646490 and the defense is in front of you so you can see how guys are positioned and you see the cutoffs and relays back to cards on stltoday com
6646491 theyve got the pitching and defense side of it and theyve had to take their at bats so they know offense as well
6646492 the world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket
6646493 conduct your blooming in the noise and whip of the whirlwind
6646494 activism can be described as intentional action to bring about social or political change this action is in support of or opposition to one side of an often controversial argument
6646495 to the public arena the problems of research and reverse power relations that are most often not in the favor of persons living with hiv aids
6646496 there is nothing i can tell you that will guarantee we can fix it
6646497 it might not fix thats the reality of it i recognize that this could very well be the end of my career i get that im not happy about it i am going to do everything i can to make sure that is not what happens
6646498 if that means surgery have the surgery and be ready if you want to pitch at least then there are no regrets
6646499 my shoulder is structurally sound thats the phrase i feel healthy but for what i have to do for a living im not
6646500 that catch could be in the outfield of a big league field instead of our backyard
6646501 i would regret not doing everything i could do to get back if this is over i can accept that but i have to exhaust every option first i have to do everything i can to come back i dont want to look back and think of the things i could have done
6646502 i just cant imagine that much water this is the worst ive seen across the state without a doubt
6646503 we were under that red spot on the radar for something like 48 hours
6646504 it was ok until the power went out around midnight weve lost all our food and everything in the freezer
6646505 we went to the school about 6 this morning but they didnt have any place to sleep so were going back in
6646506 theres cars floating down by my place and one guys harley is up to the headlight
6646507 ive lived around here all my life and this is the worst ive ever seen it
6646508 this is really sad for all these people look at all the air conditioning units covered with water theyre probably all ruined
6646509 i took my little dog out to swim yesterday and he loved it

6646515 whats the point of a roll call it is a distraction that takes away from the crowning moment for our nominee
6646516 anything that detracts from that message is a problem for us in the fall
6646517 he needs to illustrate his complete narrative and tell his personal story as americas story so that when he speaks about values responsibility hard work and opportunity they are his values and americas values
6646518 then people will see that the struggles they are facing are the struggles hes faced
6646519 the way us negotiators are talking there is no room for further negotiation on the outline of this agreement that the iraqi government must reject or accept what has been negotiated
6646520 with many details to work out yet it is unknown just how hard and fast those timetable dates might be but it seems a foregone conclusion that the agreement represents the beginning of the end of our military involvement in iraq whether the iraqis are really ready for us to leave or not
6646521 theres a third possibility of course bush could attempt to claim credit for ending the war ahead of the gop convention the night mccain speaks is themed peace but bush has already gone so far as recently as two months ago to reject even the concept of timelines even as hes capitulating to them as to make this a blatant absurdity
6646522 basic mccain spin its good news that iraq is now secure enough that we can envision bringing our troops home etc
6646523 outside of spin alley the news for mccain is mixed the agreement takes iraq largely off the table as a partisan campaign issue which might be good the public supports withdrawal so its been an achilles heel for him or might be bad it takes the spotlight off foreign affairs which he considers his strong suit overall though its got to be a negative for a guy who just a few months ago was talking about staying in iraq for a hundred years
6646524 only in massachusetts can a series of fiscally correct moves be considered a trend
6646525 but that may be exactly what you get when you add the patrick administrations efforts to roll back the 9 percent pay raise to mbta executives on top of recent moves to veto an increase for state pensioners and trying to end the police union gravy train around construction details it is a sign of what we have become used to passing for governing on the state and federal level when an executive makes news by making sound fiscal decisions even when they may have political ramifications
6646526 the more i think about it the more im drawn to the idea of moving i have no problem paying taxes to help run the state i do however take issue with paying taxes to line the pockets of the unworthy and dishonest yes corruption and greed are everywhere i know but massachusetts takes it to a whole new level
6646527 recently published data shows that out of 160 hospitals in pennsylvania only one hospital was statistically better than the national united states rate and no hospitals were worse than the average
6646528 therefore there is no significant difference in the published mortality data of the area hospitals we measure and pride ourselves on the positive safety climate that exists here at evangelical
6646529 in the majority of the reported care measures evangelical is higher than the national and state averages when it comes to safety and most appropriate care measures
6646530 weve implemented and continue to implement many safety procedures to ensure the safest experience possible for our patients
6646531 we sat out just as many people last year as we did this year depending on the experience level
6646532 you got to go out and its good to have some things not happen good
6646533 you deal with that and manage that and i think hes doing a lot of good things im pleased with his progress
6646534 theres always things i can improve on just making the right decision throwing the ball away and stuff
6646535 i think we have really good talented backup players that just need every minute of every practice
6646536 and that groups got to get better pretty much like our defense a year ago
6646537 i thought its been a good camp couldnt ask really much more of our kids than we got now
6646538 i did it when i was trying to make a tackle after an interception i landed on it pretty hard
6646539 i didnt even think about it i didnt even feel the swelling until monday when i came in and i couldnt raise my arm too high that was a little concern for me
6646540 thats one positive that came out of landing on it like that
6646541 at least you know the structure of the shoulder is back
6646542 hopefully the swelling will go down a little bit and ill be ready to go
6646543 this kind of was a little setback to me because i was getting into a pretty good groove
6646544 im just trying to be a key piece to this offense to help us win some games
6646545 hopefully i can get back and be healthy and play at a high level
6646546 usually assistants are young folks out of law school who are excited to learn not a way station for retreads whove been criticized for their less than sterling defense of voting rights laws
6646547 todd knows hans because todd works at the heritage foundation and hans contributes to the heritage foundation he has written some things about voting rights
6646548 we have never seen a political appointee exercise this level of control over the day to day operations of the voting section
6646549 voting rights policies not seen before pushing to curb minor instances of election fraud by imposing sweeping restrictions that would make it harder not easier for democratic leaning poor and minority voters to cast ballots
6646550 we have two reports dealing with voting rights that are yet to be published and my concern is what role he will have in regard to those reports
6646551 does not have any more work to be done on the voting rights briefing
6646552 were already out in customers homes theyre buying plasma tvs and connecting pcs with peripherals and printers
6646553 were now able with connectech to install service connect their devices optimize the service and really bring out the full value of what theyve purchased
6646554 there are a lot of people who have entered the service arena but have not gone far because its much harder to make this work
6646555 everyone can say they want to offer service but the first question you have to answer is are you going to own it or outsource it
6646556 obviously telecom providers are trying to take their services up the value curve but theyre also taking their customers up the learning curve
6646557 as you move up the learning curve unless you have sophisticated end users many will need help

6646562 this is what you do it for just warming up this morning and thinking of all the years of hard work that come down to this i cant believe it two medals at the olympics
6646563 i feel very disappointed i dont know why i dont think i had any technical problems or mistakes i got a silver four years ago athens 2004 olympic games but now its only a bronze its such a pity
6646564 my client is willing to sit alone with mukesh at whatever time and place he suggests
6646565 we are willing to let the brothers sit with any expert or their mother to resolve the issue
6646566 i appear for ril and mukesh ambani is not a party to the court proceedings i will have to take instructions
6646567 why dont you go back to your mother both parties should settle its not a family dispute its a matter of national importance and a resolution will be in the public interest since natural gas is a national asset
6646568 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc
6646569 an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6646570 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
6646571 i thought his velocitys getting back up to where it was
6646572 hes not there yet as compared with where he was when he was with us early in the year but thats to be expected because he hasnt been out there that many times he just looked crisp to me
6646573 there has been no definite determination of what adams role is except that hes due to pitch friday
6646574 well get him ready to go and then see where he fits in the best
6646575 i expect to go out there and compete and do very well im snapping the ball as hard or harder than i have all year
6646576 i wanted to come off a bad outing and get a good win
6646577 this is really the result of two years of very hard work
6646578 she tried too hard and tackled that turn just a little bit too tight i knew i had to take it wider not to lose speed in the final stretch
6646579 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
6646580 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
6646581 he studies hitters and he told me how he pitches to them
6646582 he gave me a couple tips during the game based on what he saw guys doing both times it worked believe it or not
6646583 every guy in that room knows we can hit better
6646584 given that there have been some discrepancies regarding her age that have come to light we have asked the fig to look into this matter
6646585 it is because of these discrepancies that we have asked for this investigation to start
6646586 since asian bodies are not the same as westerners there have been questions but there shouldnt be

6646592 ill retire and come out of retirement twice and then retire for good
6646593 i dont think i could tell you that in 15 minutes
6646594 affect people differently everybody has their goals in mind i guess their objectives when they take the field everybody has their threshold of what they think they can do just a ton of things have happened people ive met i dont think theres any one thing i do know now its becoming increasingly difficult
6646595 ive thought about it but i think im pretty focused on one game at a time
6646596 at this point in my career its come down to that
6646597 i have maybe eight starts left and i need six wins i cant rush ahead of myself
6646598 those are the same four pitches i had at the peak of my career
6646599 from what ive seen hes commanding all of his pitches
6646600 back in the day when he got down 2 and 0 you knew a heater was coming not anymore i can only imagine how tough that is on hitters i think hes
6646601 not only has he dominated hes learned how to perfect his craft along the way he learned a lot learned to harness all that aggression and feed it into the strike zone hes the consummate strike thrower in baseball that makes him who he is
6646602 i had two back surgeries my last year in new york i had a 5 era and people wanted to write me off just the guy persevered and he could pitch

6646627 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6646628 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6646629 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6646630 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6646631 obviously he does not want to come out and be arrested

6646636 i would actually rate the boys newspaper as a success because they now know what not to do and what not to write
6646637 according to the spj code of ethics journalists should strive to minimize harm unfortunately the mayberry sun actually maximized the hurt
6646638 one of the biggest lessons to learn from this episode is that you need to test the accuracy of your information not just go with what you hear on the streets
6646639 the boys used quotes and opinions in their newspaper from just one person they didnt contact multiple sources nor did they confirm things to make sure they were accurate and factual
6646640 i would rate their newspaper as both a success and a failure they failed to show true facts when they were writing gossip but they succeeded when they wrote their paper about the little things in their school because they were not just telling gossip
6646641 one journalism lesson to be learned from this episode is to always get the full story if you put in gossip then you are not getting the general public any real information which is what they pay for in a newspaper
6646642 opie and howie probably violated almost every elementary ethic known to the journalism profession andy says it himself when he tells opie that just because somebody says it doesnt mean it should be printed this episode really does teach a good lesson about community journalism and the intentions a local newspaper must consider

6646646 what had to be done was done this animal is no longer suffering
6646647 the only way it could have been done without suffering
6646648 all our experience that orrca has with cetaceans in this situation is that they very easily get stressed and a very quick dont think about it response is not the way to go
6646649 you need to gather your information talk to as many people as you can and thats exactly what national parks did
6646650 it was a pre programmed effort by the relevant authorities to slaughter the whale
6646651 they went out with a harpoon euthanasia lance to kill that whale
6646652 i personally watched that whale swim from one end of the bay to the other in five minutes it continuously dived under two boats nuzzling for a feed
6646653 all i wanted to do was step on that boat and leech some fluid into the water
6646654 we have the engineering device to install on a yacht and a simulated whale blubber that we could manufacture and put together at the very low cost of 10 000 within 24 hours
6646655 we wanted approval from the relevant government authority to go ahead with and do that were not radical were a marine salvage unit
6646656 we had a reprieve yesterday thursday at 4pm of 24 hours half an hour later i was informed that im sorry were retracting that were putting that whale down now
6646657 if the national parks people could possibly have done something for it they would have
6646658 theyve got to find an answer to it so many people are suffering with it
6646659 shes at the top of the list as far as fashion fit and fabric
6646660 its very modern but clean thats truly the woman i go after the fact that its in vogue now makes it a thousand times more fun for me
6646661 especially with the euro being so strong and the u s dollar being so weak i think a lot of younger people who had initially avoided them are staying there because they are hearing so many great things about them and money is tight
6646662 its not only youth filling up the hostel anymore like in the 70s
6646663 are more expensive but also provide more privacy and luxury
6646664 they can be surprisingly expensive for the quality so i suppose the image of the cheap backpackers hostel is rapidly disappearing
6646665 they talk about the price but it doesnt prevent them from coming here and travelling
6646666 we chose hostels because i think we wanted a more authentic backpacking experience
6646667 for the time we were in italy we stayed in budget hotels and by the end of it we were excited to get back to staying in larger rooms with more people
6646668 i really miss doing as many interviews as i used to
6646669 i think theres something about the web vibe and i know that makes me sound very out of it to use the word vibe but im looking forward to being able to have more casual but hopefully hard hitting coverage if thats not too counter intuitive
6646670 a distinct venue to mix good food and lively political debate
6646671 its very ambitious and a huge commitment of resources i dont think by the end of fall anybody will be able to say cbs just talked about the polls and the candidates latest gaffes
6646672 talking to real people is one of my strong suits and hopefully this gives me a chance to get out its frustrating sometimes to be behind the desk all the time and not interacting with people and talking to them making people comfortable and guiding the interview and being a good listener
6646673 this will be an opportunity to do some of that
6646674 the bottom line is infrastructure needs and the maintenance costs are outpacing the revenue and were struggling
6646675 i hate to leave one student sitting there on the waiting list and odds are that somebodys moved and forgotten to tell us so let me crunch some numbers in a couple classes and get back to you
6646676 it took him a day to jump right back out there
6646677 down the road hes going to be a big factor for us
6646678 teksten verzinnen om mensen aan het lachen te maken iets leuker om doen kan ik niet bedenken
6646679 mijn comeback op de planken bewaar ik misschien wel voor mijn tachtigste levensjaar
6646680 momenteel ben ik weer helemaal smoor op de televisiecamera vroeger combineerde ik alles televisie en radiowerk theater dat wil ik niet meer
6646681 met een beetje geluk krijgen we volgende week droog en zonnig weer en temperaturen tot 25 graden
6646682 we halen geen 20 graden en dat is te koud voor de tijd van het jaar
6646683 de bovenluchten zijn z r koud op 5 km hoogte bedraagt de temperatuur amper 25 graden er is dus een groot verticaal contrast wat maakt dat er stevige buien kunnen vallen met zelfs onweer we krijgen een koude heldere nacht en zaterdagochtend is zonnig maar ook nog heel fris met temperaturen beneden de 10 graden
6646684 in de loop van de dag winnen de stapelwolken het van de zon we halen niet meer dan 20 graden het blijft overwegend droog maar plaatselijke buien zijn niet uit te sluiten ook zondag start zonnig na de middag bewolkt het in het binnenland zal het droog blijven voor de kust voorspel ik een weinig regen
6646685 85 procent van de modellen voorspellen voor maandag tot vrijdag overwegend droog weer met geregeld zon en temperaturen van 23 24 graden in de kempen tot 25 graden
6646686 maar lasgo is m jn kindje en omdat er zoveel aanvragen binnenkwamen zijn we terug van start gegaan met jelle
6646687 vooral door haar mooie stem is ze de perfecte keuze we willen niet dat ze zomaar de nieuwe evi wordt jelle moet haar eigenheid bewaren
6646688 vroeger speelde ik met barbie nu mag ik zelf barbie zijn ik vind het vooral leuk dat we lekker kunnen overdrijven
6646689 wel gek dat ik nu zelf de liedjes zing waar ik een paar jaar geleden naar luisterde
6646690 ik besef het allemaal nog niet zo goed maar dat zal wel komen als ik een paar keer voor een groot publiek heb gestaan lacht ik m est gewoon zangeres worden iets anders zie ik mij niet doen
6646691 we hebben een contract getekend met een platenfirma in amerika en ook londen is ge nteresseerd
6646692 natuurlijk beginnen er ook aanvragen binnen te lopen voor optredens in het binnenland op 3 september zijn we te zien in tien om te zien op vtm en drie dagen later staat jelle voor haar eerste showcase op het podium in destelbergen
6646693 vorig jaar was de zomer ook slecht maar toen viel de minderverkoop nog goed mee
6646694 mensen refereerden aan de zomer voordien en kochten nog massaal een zwembad dit jaar is de zomer van 2007 een ijkpunt en aangezien die niet veel soeps was merken we dit jaar dat de verkoop met 20 gedaald is het fenomeen dat daarvan een gevolg is warmtepompen en zonnepanelen worden dit jaar w l goed verkocht
6646695 de mensen die nu met dat zwembad opgescheept zitten willen er toch nog iets plezier uithalen en dat kan alleen door het water goed te verwarmen
6646696 dat zijn mensen die ooit in een impuls een opblaasbaar of ander goedkoop zwembad hebben gekocht en na een tijd dan toch een echt zwembad willen laten ingraven die mensen zien nu met het slechte weer en de hoge energieprijzen van hun aankoop af bij de hogere klasse is er geen daling die laat nog even vaak met de villa mee een zwembad bouwen en de rijkere vroeg gepensioneerden kiezen voor hele wellnesscomplexen met zwembad poolhouse jacuzzi n sauna
6646697 een paar jaar nu al geven we over heel vlaanderen seminaries zelf een zwembad bouwen en die zijn een succes
6646698 een zwembad dat normaal 25 000 euro kost kun je als je het zelf plaatst voor 10 000 tot 15 000 euro hebben
6646699 het huis blijft bewoonbaar met een afzuiginstallatie proberen we de brandgeur uit de woning te krijgen
6646700 we hoorden aan de paniekerige stemmen buiten dat er iets loos was
6646701 we hebben met emmers water nog even meegeblust ook al hing er veel rook binnen
6646702 i know some people might see it as a little kids sport
6646703 people look at the 100 meter athletes and know they are elite they should look at these guys the same way
6646704 im the healthiest ive been all my life my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things
6646705 trucks are pulling up non stop from printers all over the city ottawa
6646706 they students attend a performing arts school for first through 12th grades for instrument dance or voice
6646707 they take regular school classes and classes in their chosen instrument it is very much the closest thing they have to the harrison school of the arts in lakeland that is why they are going there to present a concert their school in lithuania is a very prestigious school
6646708 they perform in different configurations including solos duets and the like
6646709 here they have a set program and they know who goes next with whom they all work together very well our family has stayed up late enjoying concerts in our home i dont think my piano knows what has moved in
6646710 my youngest is a violinist at florida state university and she attended the harrison school
6646711 we enjoy that kind of music so when i found out that they needed host families i volunteered
6646712 they dont have as many choices in shopping at home as we do here i guess
6646713 they really are very easy to get along with and are very comfortable in their surroundings we have a pianist and violist staying with us and together they have really entertained us
6646714 se trata de un sistema de alarma que se acciona mediante un pulsador instalado en un lugar de la vivienda que solo conoce el propietario y los moradores de la misma se permite instalar m s de un pulsador por casa dado que el sistema es compartido por dos o m s vecinos cuando se acciona el pulsador en la casa que atraviesa una emergencia comienzan a sonar las alarmas del resto de la cuadra durante un lapso de dos minutos en tanto que alarma que origin el alerta continuar sonando hasta que se la detenga manualmente

6646716 we have heard from other viewers concerning this issue and are working to provide hd service for preseason games in future seasons
6646717 we are committed to supporting and growing both the cbs television network and the cw network in the pittsburgh market
6646718 while the cbs network has a longer history and a larger following there are viewers who are extremely passionate about both networks programs we apologize for the disruption and appreciate the loyal viewership i can assure you that cws americas next top model and gossip girl viewers would react with the same passion as cbss big brother viewers
6646719 it looks like shes saying they were running out of boxes due to overwhelming demand for their upgraded service and new lower priced package so we in the north hills arent getting these upgrades because they dont want to run out of cable boxes that might be the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard heres an idea make the new customers wait for their box and give those of us who have been waiting forever for these channels what we want and have been paying a higher price for

6646721 new customers with multiple telstra services can receive a discount of 12 months half price off their wireless broadband access
6646722 a lot of people dont understand what a bridge is but for me its the most important part of a song next to the chorus if you go straight from verse to chorus it throws your timing out because then either the verse has to be too long and becomes boring or the chorus comes in too early to me the ideally paced song is one which has a chorus type intro for about eight bars which at 120bpm lasts for about 16 seconds then an eight bar verse and an eight bar bridge which means youre up to about a minute for your first chorus if the chorus happens any later than that the radio stations will take if off because theyre fed up but if youve got a good bridge leading up to something they feel drawn to it

6646745 att k pa 100 procent av ett bolag genom ett bud som har en os ker utg ng r inte alltid det mest intressanta det kan vara aktuellt att ta en aktiv position med ett l ngsiktigt perspektiv genom en minoritetsinvestering
6646746 vi kan t nka oss att exempelvis samarbeta med banker att g in i bolag som r sunda men har en f r h g skulds ttning och hj lpa till att skapa en ny kapitalstruktur
6646747 bara f r att du gt ett bolag i ungef r fem r inneb r det inte att m jligheterna r slut det har vi bland annat sett i hur stor marknaden varit f r s kallade secondary buy outs d r ett riskkapitalbolag k pt ett f retag av ett annat

6646792 hai orang orang yang beriman jika kamu menolong agama allah nescaya dia akan menolongmu dan meneguhkan kedudukanmu
6646793 mereka berkehendak memadamkan cahaya agama allah dengan mulut ucapan ucapan mereka dan allah tidak menghendaki selain menyempurnakan cahayanya walaupun orang orang yang kafir tidak menyukai
6646794 sesungguhnya orang orang yang kafir menafkahkan harta mereka untuk menghalangi orang dari jalan allah mereka akan menafkahkan harta itu kemudian menjadi sesalan bagi mereka dan mereka akan dikalahkan dan ke dalam neraka jahannamlah orang orang yang kafir itu dikumpulkan

6646798 hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu mengambil orang orang yahudi dan nasrani menjadi pemimpin pemimpin mu sebahagian mereka adalah pemimpin bagi sebahagian yang lain barangsiapa di antara kamu mengambil mereka menjadi pemimpin maka sesungguhnya orang itu termasuk golongan mereka sesungguhnya allah tidak memberi petunjuk kepada orang orang yang zalim
6646799 sesungguhnya kamu dapati orang orang yang paling keras permusuhannya terhadap orang orang yang beriman ialah orang orang yahudi dan orang orang musyrik
6646800 ya tuhan kami kami telah beriman maka catatlah kami bersama orang orang yang menjadi saksi atas kebenaran al qur an dan kenabian muhammad s a w
6646801 maka kerana itu serulah mereka kepada agama ini dan tetaplah sebagai mana diperintahkan kepadamu dan janganlah mengikuti hawa nafsu mereka dan katakanlah
6646802 allah tidak melarang kamu untuk berbuat baik dan berlaku adil terhadap orang orang yang tiada memerangimu kerana agama dan tidak pula mengusir kamu dari negerimu sesungguhnya allah menyukai orang orang yang berlaku adil sesungguhnya allah hanya melarang kamu menjadikan sebagai kawanmu orang orang yang memerangimu kerana agama dan mengusir kamu dari negerimu dan membantu orang lain untuk mengusirmu dan barangsiapa menjadikan mereka sebagai kawan maka mereka itulah orang orang yang zalim
6646803 im just really happy its hard work for my entire life that came through now
6646804 i trained really hard for this and im just really happy that i finally get a medal in my individual event
6646805 i think my training was going really well and i was able tonight to stay focused on what i had to do and not stay focused on my result or on how the other divers were doing i think that was the big key
6646806 i lost a few pounds not much three or four but i think it made a big difference for me today
6646807 i was a little lighter so it was a little easier for me to make the dives
6646808 i think its what happened in the past that made the person that i am today and made me dive like this today
6646809 im just going to enjoy the moment and think about the future later
6646810 i was a little surprised that i was leading but i was sure that it was really close
6646811 i knew that the chinese diver had a really good last dive and she could do it for 10s most of the time

6646813 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6646814 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6646815 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6646816 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us

6646823 cemex believes the confiscation and subsequent start of the expropriation process is a flagrant violation of the constitution law of expropriation and other laws of venezuela

6646825 i think the team just came together the first time we played them cuba kicked our butts but that didnt deter us
6646826 we always fight we came together as one unit when we first started playing we played individually it was ugly and we made a lot of errors
6646827 the us team played very well however we didnt especially on service and reception
6646828 there were two points that differed from the preliminary game where cuba did very well on serve and reception
6646829 the us did it very well and we didnt they were very well prepared and played to their potential

6646838 the uk opposes the death penalty in all circumstances as a matter of principle we take any request for uk police assistance seriously and evaluate each case individually
6646839 this was a different matter even though antigua also imposes the death penalty
6646840 we have always said that the roles missions and size of the american forces here the coalition forces was based on the conditions on the ground and what is needed
6646841 will review the security situation in the country and if necessary will ask the american side for certain forces for training or supporting the iraqi security forces
6646842 how is it possible that officials didnt know there had been a technical mistake
6646843 the us have the right to protest but why when officials disqualified spearmon did they not notice churandys violation
6646844 i dont understand it if i stood on the line then why did the jury not disqualify me at the same time as spearmon it was at least 90 minutes before they told me i was disqualified
6646845 we recognise that the race footage indicates a technical mistake we will examine however whether the rules make it possible to disqualify an athlete in this way
6646846 its a pity for a big country like the united states to make such a small statement
6646847 its great to come out and defend my gold medal
6646848 its been great to see jamaica get a clean sweep of the sprints now i have to concentrate on the relays
6646849 but i just have to remember the verse in the bible which says give thanks in every circumstance
6646850 the start was bad and the end wasnt that great either but im grateful for the silver
6646851 bolt started it off and jamaicas sprinters have just kept it going
6646852 we have a great tradition of sprinters and we wanted to show what we could do here
6646853 it would be really good to take the dare to dream exhibition to toronto for st lucians here as well as the wider toronto to see and i will talk to you off air about this possibility
6646854 i was so moved by oprahs statement that i have put the pitons on display for the entire world to see now st lucians living abroad as well as the rest of the world can freely enjoy a slice of our paradise
6646855 by developing such strategic relationships with international business partners not only am i promoting st lucia abroad but i am also showing the world countless reasons to visit st lucia starting with our natural beauty then going further to show that there are world class professionals right here in st lucia
6646856 by being invited to join pictage now anyone who enlists my photographic services can have their work produced by the same people who work for the stars
6646857 and the first pictage album will be delivered to a proud st lucian bride shortly
6646858 it is important that as photographers we sensitize our clients to the significance of the legal use of the intellectual property that we produce whenever we are commissioned
6646859 the problem is with the advent of digital photography our equipment has become much more expensive becomes obsolete every 3 5 years and requires programs where sometimes a key must be purchased for every machine on which that program is installed
6646860 bolt put on a show tonight wednesday to me its just like michael phelps in swimming he raised the bar for us
6646861 hes made history hes broken a 12 year old record held by michael johnson and the same time he crushed the 100 meter record
6646862 usain bolt is the fastest man ive ever seen in my life
6646863 the 19 30 to me wasnt strange ive watched usain perform all year
6646864 hes been putting up phenomenal times i watched him do the rounds of the 100m he set a record in that at 9 69 i figured he had a chance to break the record here i just didnt know if he would have it in his legs still after eight rounds that was expected i knew it was going to be a fast race usain is a phenomenal athlete
6646865 when he was introduced he was dancing and the crowd loves it it adds a bit of sparkle and cheer
6646866 i am delighted with this choice and feel sure that in mrs inez archibald the bvi will continue its tradition of appointing outstanding individuals to this key position i am further confident that mrs archibald working closely with the governor and the elected government will contribute to good governance help deliver agreed policy priorities and promote improved efficiency and morale in the public service
6646867 her majesty may designate as such by instructions given through a secretary of state and who shall hold office during her majestys pleasure
6646868 i am delighted about the appointment it is a privilege to serve my country
6646869 i dont know what kind of races they would ever expect to get there i dont think there is the interest in this part of the country to support a race track for real hard core racing
6646870 theres been no formal application with the city weve seen ideas concepts
6646871 right off the bat are traffic and noise how are we going to get people there
6646872 we have to get our public hearing with our residents
6646873 they havent presented anything to us including if theyre going to do something about the traffic and the noise
6646874 pdvsa petroleos de venezuela and petrovietnam will work together to build the two joint companies one to transport oil to vietnam and the other to refine that oil in vietnam at a refinery we jointly own
6646875 it will meet not only our needs but also those of alba members and countries in south america that cooperate with us including cuba
6646876 great pride and pleasure that i extend to ms fraser and ms walker in particular and their compatriots for the fine example they have offered to regional youth of world class excellence
6646877 it is a coalition of the willing what was missing over so many years we believe was the political will the desire was there the political will was much more difficult to muster but on this occasion that is what we started to do that is why we made the commitment to bring to economic union by 2015 these are the times we have set and we are committed to work towards achieving those goals it is a coalition of the willing a big difference
6646878 this arrangement in no way prejudices the oecs arrangement in fact is preserves it by going to the economic union first the oecs is preserved and in doing that we are also advancing the caricom agenda going to a single economy in caricom by 2015
6646879 when that happens and there is one economic space between trinidad and tobago and the oecs countries and any other country that signs into it then we can now take the process one step further to political union without prejudicing the integrity of the organisation of eastern caribbean states or caricom for that matter once you have the single economic space then within arrangement any group of countries can go to a political union without prejudicing what exists on the table and in that regard we set a date for political union by 2015
6646880 we believe that the circumstances of the world today have changed significantly we no longer have the preferential markets access in europe and elsewhere for sugar and bananas and many countries have moved to tourism with the vagaries that are associated with that as fragile as that can be
6646881 a union that gives us not just the safety in numbers but greater economic weight as we seek to move the caribbean forward we believe that the caribbean comprises one people we have a common heritage
6646882 they are expected to come up with that by the 31st december 2008 in the same way that the memorandum of understanding signed by the four prime ministers and which is now open for signature by all others who wish to be part of it is to be ratified by the 31st december 2008
6646883 it is not an initiative that is conducted at prime ministerial level but the people must be involved and must be part of an integration which after all is designed for people
6646884 do not go gentle into that good night blog blog against the dying of the light
6646885 you have to follow these directions or the doctor cant do the test
6646886 sorry i am never chugging a gallon of magnesium citrate solution again its grotesque and revolting i want the sodium solution instead i tolerate it well and thats acceptable this is not

6646889 i would expect that the heads of government would respond positively
6646890 there is very little that we can send into europe and this will negatively affect our balance of trade and our balance of payment
6646891 given the regions dependence on airlift the most daunting issues facing the caribbean hotel industry are the rising cost of airfares and the announced cutbacks in air service
6646892 due mostly to the rising cost of fuel four of the five leading air carriers to the caribbean have announced cutbacks in service puerto rico and the dominican republic could see as many as 26 percent fewer flights in december of 2008 compared to december 2007
6646893 the caribbean has always been attractive to price sensitive travelers if airfares continue to rise hotels may have to reduce their room rates in an effort to maintain the caribbeans position as an affordable destination
6646894 despite the strength of the market we have seen shifts in the cruise industry that have been influenced by the rising cost of fuel cruises to more remote ports in the southern caribbean such as aruba are being cut from itineraries due to the length of the trip and fuel required to get there
6646895 to preserve the natural beauty of the region caribbean resorts have had a long history of being environmentally friendly
6646896 hotel operators are now parlaying this experience into energy conservation in addition to installing cost cutting equipment such as efficient light bulbs showers toilets sinks and air conditioning caribbean hoteliers are working with their local energy providers to develop new sustainable technologies this will not only reduce the cost of operations but improve the overall economy of the island on which they operate
6646897 if you profile the hotel projects that are currently under construction there youll find a preponderance of luxury and upper upscale properties
6646898 like the recent trend in the united states most of these projects are resorts with a significant residential component and first class spa
6646899 belize and costa rica are two markets that are becoming increasingly competitive with the caribbean as a vacation destination for us citizens as well as travelers from europe and south america
6646900 historically caribbean hotels have enjoyed the benefit of paying their employees relatively low salaries and wages however due to rising standards of living among the islands we have started to see a closing of the gap between us and caribbean labors costs
6646901 there were several other psychiatric patients in the ward at the time why only this one they jump and lay charge against
6646902 i ask myself who is the person that say they saw when he leonard light the fire why they not out it
6646903 normally over time he misbehave i go to the court and take an oath so that he can be seen by a doctor after he was arrested i went to the court and on tuesday and the magistrate issued a warrant so that he can go back to the hospital and get checked up but the police still keeping my son
6646904 this is about the fourth time since he start behaving like that the court issued warrants but the police keeping him or what reason i dont know
6646905 i definitely would love to run on the 4x400 relay team
6646906 but i dont want to go in and take another persons spot

6646908 jamaicas 4x400m team will be strong i would love to run but with or with me the team is going to be wicked
6646909 the carifesta x coin is another expression of our nationhood and it is the perfect souvenir for nationals and visitors alike
6646910 while it commemorates the return of the festival to its place of birth its design gives due recognition to the oneness of the caribbean in this celebration
6646911 a stage according to internationally accepted design has been erected at the national stadium and will be used for among other things the opening ceremony where more than 3000 participants will perform
6646912 we are only waiting for the occupants among whom will be international participants from nine countries displaying their national cuisine by actually preparing them on the spot these participants are expected to arrive in the country and take up their slots

6646914 to study the issues and to study the modalities of how the countries should proceed concerning the new initiative of trinidad and tobago joining with three oecs countries to join the sub region
6646915 what steps we should take what is the arrangement so that we can come to a common position of which we hope to do by december 2008 then we are off and running
6646916 what is different on this occasion from other occasions is the political will we have a number of prime ministers in office in the caribbean now who against the background of our experience over the many years and experiences elsewhere in the world have now come to the conclusion that either we integrate or we disintegrate
6646917 external conditions aside we continue to deliver improved earnings with healthy margins and i am pleased with our second quarter results
6646918 while we continue to pursue our 2008 financial strategy we are very focused on bringing more customers into our stores

6646923 it isnt just a privacy issue it is a trespassing issue with their own photos as evidence they really went off the track to get to our address
6646924 on orr ranch road a private street outside of santa rosa google drove its car past a private road sign and continued photographing for nearly a mile near freestone the company drove past a no trespassing sign and through a gate to take photographs from a dirt road that passed through someones yard the images allowed internet users to see inside someones living room window
6646925 turning around in a private driveway while photographing the exterior of a home is not a substantial intrusion

6646927 they thought the library was a dangerous place because of all the magical books which was true enough but what made it really one of the most dangerous places there could ever be was the simple fact that it was a library

6646933 more and more people keep contacting us about getting involved in co housing communities theres an unquenchable thirst for this sort of thing
6646934 with the home we were living in before it would have been very difficult to do a lot of retro fitting to it or do things to make it more energy efficient
6646935 but here were moving to a place where other people have spent a lot of time thinking about these things and have made very good choices about the energy efficiency of the home and its environmental impact someone else has taken the time and effort and had the expertise to make those choices carefully and weve taken advantage of it by buying into it
6646936 this summer i can cool off my house by closing it up during the day i dont need any air con in the winter the amount of heat i have to use is really small because the insulation is tremendous its exciting to live that way
6646937 i think we have been environmentally conscious for a long time and have tried to be thoughtful about the way we live but thats the way a lot more people are now anyway
6646938 a lot of the basic concepts behind co housing are applicable to larger housing developments
6646939 some of the principles could be woven in to conventional developments things like having the residential area car free having a common house where you can eat communally from time to time hold events and have a childrens room and games room for teenagers

6646946 everyone is very connected to this animal and it is a very emotional decision
6646947 ive taken the decision that i dont want to prolong the agony of this animal
6646948 it was absolutely disgusting they have towed him behind the boat scenes reminiscent of what weve seen the japanese fishing trawlers do he was clearly still alive he was clearly moving the line was thrashing
6646949 i dont understand why they didnt let it die quietly it was obviously distressed im 41 years old and almost collapsed
6646950 it would face a higher predation pressure from sharks there is absolutely no information to suggest another humpback whale female would be available or wanting to adopt it
6646951 it does happen from time to time that calfs especially those born so far south of the birthing grounds will not make it
6646952 he heard me singing and came over i looked at him and he was full of life he had a few scratches and cuts on him and i was a bit worried about his eyes all he needed is a mothers milk

6646965 oh well that means only orcs can be in orc guilds
6646966 we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counterproductive

6646985 were now able with connectech to install service connect their devices optimize the service and really bring out the full value of what theyve purchased
6646986 there are a lot of people who have entered the service arena but have not gone far because its much harder to make this work
6646987 everyone can say they want to offer service but the first question you have to answer is are you going to own it or outsource it
6646988 obviously telecom providers are trying to take their services up the value curve but theyre also taking their customers up the learning curve
6646989 as you move up the learning curve unless you have sophisticated end users many will need help

6646999 prime minister kevin rudd should use his relationship with british prime minister gordon brown to convince the uk government to purchase the boomerang and donate it to australia in a gesture of friendship and to mark our shared heritage
6647000 the boomerang should be returned to kurnell as a symbol of that first meeting and so all australians have the opportunity to see it
6647001 having the boomerang back in kurnell will be an historic symbol of harmony between our two cultures and will help teach young australians about the importance of aboriginal culture

6647010 while it is necessary in todays climate to have centralised top class facilities for racing this should not mean that we do appreciate the great role that country tracks have played in our development
6647011 the tpc has already put in place the revival of the brighton cup with a top class race day scheduled for 1st march 2009
6647012 we have now made a decision to revive the sorell cup which was first run in 1933 at northall park now defunct and run there until 1940
6647013 in 1941 it was moved to the royal showground before being switched to sorell until that venue fell victim to the infamous 1967 bush fires
6647014 at this stage the plan is to run the event on 15 march 2009 at tattersalls park

6647029 if we dont take into account the fact that the organization that we are negotiating with seems helpless in the face of so called recalcitrant or they call it rogue elements
6647030 well have to go back and make an assessment the president had indicated we would like to get civil society and the stakeholders and now principally the bishops of mindanao to help us determine what would be the next step
6647031 from negotiations our focus shall shift to dialogue with the communities or government conducting authentic conversations or dialogues with the people the focus of our talks shall shift from armed groups to the community the parameters governing our negotiations shall be a balance between constitutionality and public sentiment

6647046 luckily assistant coach david ellis stayed we convinced then clinton head coach jimmy gaylor to come over here we had a great staff it was a good mix of coaches we had a good mix of players coming through but ordinarily i dont think its a good idea to follow a coach whos just won a state championship
6647047 they said it was going to be different and they were right but for the most part its been really good
6647048 you could tell after a minute or two that i might have been in the wrong interview room
6647049 those guys know a little bit more than i know for sure but it was a great experience to be a high school coach and have the opportunity to be in that situation
6647050 it was a good experience in that also ive realized this is what i need to be doing this is what i like to do there is definitely a challenge in doing this theres a change in lifestyle doing that other thing that im not willing to try yet and may never be willing to try

6647092 to offer us almost two per cent less than standard inflation of 5 1 per cent is simply kicking us when were down
6647093 in order to gain a further 0 75 per cent increase on their existing offer the state government has demanded we concede standard conditions

6647155 there have been much hotter longer lasting and larger fires in skyscrapers that have not fallen down

6647157 it did not collapse from explosives or fuel oil fires
6647158 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6647159 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6647198 traditionally and historically we think america is more reliable than europe in 1918 we regained independence thanks to the u s when world war ii began in 1939 we were let down by our allies britain and france but the u s has never failed us
6647199 no one will ever again tell poland what to do and what not to do
6647200 if poland allows elements of the u s missile shield to be placed in its territory it will expose itself to a strike and thats a hundred percent sure
6647201 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6647202 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6647203 when i used to play against him you just couldnt throw the ball in the middle of the field because

6647213 mi hija est muy unida a keila qued muy afectada al ver las fotos del accidente no me atrevo ni a dec rselo
6647214 los vamos a echar mucho de menos ha sido una desgracia y toda la familia est muy sentida
6647215 la situaci n es muy triste por todo y m s cuando sabes que hay alguien del entorno del territorio malague o nuestro recuerdo est muy presente hacia los familiares de esta familia
6647216 realmente no hay un momento dr stico de mi llegada al mundo del toreo a m siempre me ha gustado
6647217 el miedo es una parte clave del toreo est presente porque eres consciente de lo que te juegas y de lo que te puede pasar dentro de ese miedo est n a la par otros sentimientos que hacen que el toreo sea m s bello y m s profundo el miedo se supera con esfuerzo con entrenamiento con dedicaci n con amor propio con ambici n el valor es una cosa innata que los toreros como muchas personas en la vida tienen en el caso de los matadores se refleja en su seguridad delante del toro en el convencimiento de que vas a superar las complicaciones
6647218 en el triunfo lo primero que sientes es satisfacci n por las cosas bien hechas luego creo que hay un punto de ego en el torero que alimenta bastante al torero te sientes pleno
6647219 cuando las cosas no salen bien sientes decepci n impotencia tambi n depende de que tengas la conciencia tranquila de si crees que has estado bien o no pero se aprende sin duda mucho m s del fracaso que del triunfo a m personalmente el fracaso es lo que m s me ha ense ado el triunfo no te invita a meditar no hay que vivir tanto en el triunfo
6647220 el momento de m s tensi n es antes del pase llo ah lo pasas peor y mantener una sonrisa a veces te cuesta mucho luego est la soledad del hotel y ah piensas en que no haya algo que no seas capaz de hacer piensas en el fracaso piensas en el triunfo en la corrida en los toros un c mulo de sensaciones que pasa muy r pido
6647221 un torero tiene que nacer torero y hacerse torero un torero sin cualidades por muchos esfuerzos que haga es pr cticamente imposible que triunfe y un torero con todas las cualidades del mundo si no trabaja no entrena y no se esfuerza por evolucionar tampoco llega a nada adem s el mundo del toreo es un mundo donde se habla mucho de respeto de pureza de admiraci n de verg enza torera creo que si en la vida se siguen los principios que los matadores tenemos te puede ir muy bien
6647222 yo he vivido momentos de una compenetraci n con el toro total y en los que no he sentido el miedo al enemigo si no la colaboraci n de un amigo sos son los mejores momentos del toreo sos en los que est s como en una conversaci n ntima con el toro y donde no hay nadie m s por muy llena que est la plaza lo peor de esto es todo lo que rodea al montaje del toreo como todos los mundos donde hay inter s y dinero hay mucha gente interesada que no act a de buena fe
6647223 el torero sobre todo sufre por uno mismo despu s tambi n es cierto que te da pena que todas esas personas que aportan algo en tu vida y est n a tu lado tengan que sufrir en tu fracaso y hay otro tipo de sufrimiento el da o psicol gico de las cogidas de las heridas que es mucho m s traum tico que el f sico que salvo raras excepciones casi siempre es m s o menos recuperable pero el psicol gico el haber pasado por el trance de que te haya cogido un toro nos hace sufrir mucho nos hace pensar mucho nos provoca mucha ansiedad el momento de volver a ponerte delante de un toro despu s de una cornada es muy duro adem s hay cogidas de las que reapareces y est s en el sitio pero otras que te quitan ese sitio y te cuesta mucho llegar a donde estabas
6647224 en el toreo existe mucha much sima rivalidad aunque a veces es diferente a como la ven los periodistas o los propios aficionados nosotros cuando un compa ero est bien le damos mucho m s valor incluso que el p blico pero tambi n es cierto que eso hace que quieras ser mejor que l y de ah la rivalidad taurina pero la competencia es tambi n un eje del toreo la superaci n es clave para dar siempre un paso m s los toreros que est n solos tienden como humanos que son a ser m s ego stas y a conformarse un poco m s
6647225 la familia es la base fundamental de toda mi vida es mi apoyo imprescindible donde he aprendido todos los principios morales importantes que una persona debe tener mis familiares han sido mi gran ejemplo y quiz s son de lo que m s orgulloso me siento en mi vida
6647226 el torero tiene que reflexionar mucho hay veces que me puedo encontrar en una plaza con 20 000 espectadores y sentir una soledad aterradora el torero est muchas veces solo aunque est rodeado de personas
6647227 yo no tengo una faena so ada la faena perfecta ser a muy fr a y el toreo es pasi n es entrega y sentimiento
6647228 when i used to play against him you just couldnt throw the ball in the middle of the field because

6647248 arent the green mps supposed to be experts in this very area dont they claim to know more about it than almost everyone in the country and havent they specifically been elected on the basis of this expertise with the expectation that they can make informed decisions about environmental policy theyve spent the last three years lecturing the country in a condescending manner to buy kiwi made and not to smack your kids but when it comes to the issue that is the raison detre for their party theyre little lost sheep as paula points out this might just be a stunt or a bargaining strategy if thats the case its a conspicuously stupid one
6647249 a lot of dancers use wax in their shows choose plain soft paraffin unscented non colored candles because they melt at the lowest temperatures the harder the wax the hotter the temperature and that will sting test it before you pour it let the candle burn until a pool of wax has formed blow out the flame wait a bit then pour it in drops you want to make sure the candle is high so the wax drops cool as they fall

6647269 i dont think we can necessarily save these jobs today but what we have got to do is get the setting in place for the long term
6647270 so many of these things have been put in the too hard basket for too long the government is going to front up and accept its responsibility and do something for the long term
6647271 we understand the importance of the industry what a big employer it ford is a big exporter it is and were addressing those issues as well
6647272 there is an air of insecurity out there and thats why it is important that instead of getting constant announcements about job losses were wanting to get some announcements about investment
6647273 we know that the industry is facing these acute challenges and i cant say with any certainty that there wont be further announcements in regard to job losses
6647274 what were seeing here is the legacy of neglect from the previous government
6647275 this industry has been left on automatic pilot pretty much since 2002
6647276 it was frustrating when i was dusting myself off but really i was there
6647277 i learned a lot and experienced so much for my first olympics i will take that onto the next one
6647278 this morning i didnt even have practice because i had a mechanical problem
6647279 my first lap on the track was my first time on the track this morning
6647280 it wasnt the way i wanted to qualify but i did being in the final and falling you cant be too upset i learned so much this olympics really hasnt went my way but ive persevered and im confident for the next four years
6647281 everybody is so cool i think a lot of people enjoyed it i think its the sport to watch in four years
6647282 if you can hear the thunder youre close enough to be struck by lightning
6647283 to destroy an animal of this size is never an easy task
6647284 what had to be done was done this animal is no longer suffering
6647285 the only way it could have been done without suffering
6647286 all our experience that orrca has with cetaceans in this situation is that they very easily get stressed and a very quick dont think about it response is not the way to go
6647287 you need to gather your information talk to as many people as you can and thats exactly what national parks did
6647288 it was a pre programmed effort by the relevant authorities to slaughter the whale
6647289 they went out with a harpoon euthanasia lance to kill that whale
6647290 i personally watched that whale swim from one end of the bay to the other in five minutes it continuously dived under two boats nuzzling for a feed
6647291 all i wanted to do was step on that boat and leech some fluid into the water
6647292 we have the engineering device to install on a yacht and a simulated whale blubber that we could manufacture and put together at the very low cost of 10 000 within 24 hours
6647293 we wanted approval from the relevant government authority to go ahead with and do that were not radical were a marine salvage unit
6647294 we had a reprieve yesterday thursday at 4pm of 24 hours half an hour later i was informed that im sorry were retracting that were putting that whale down now
6647295 if the national parks people could possibly have done something for it they would have
6647296 ofte er det netop de mest helhjertede der g r fejl her det er ikke godt for de kristnes enhed det skaber tvivl og skader hele kirkens omd mme i samfundet og det skader os selv personligt n r vi ford mmer andre kristne

6647298 last season wes was probably in our top two or three most consistent players
6647299 he deserved all the success he got including an england place
6647300 i think what everyone is interested in and clearly what the community has consistently told us is that they want to maintain that quality of orchestra in pittsburgh
6647301 we realize we owe it to this city and the people who made the orchestra great every contract is a homage to the past
6647302 but maintain that nebulous connection that accomplishment equals legacy equals career goals sometimes you cant separate the two money and prestige
6647303 the economic downturn which happened around 2000 2001 for a lot of nonprofit organizations was not over when it was over for the rest of the country
6647304 for a lot of nonprofit organizations that was one of the longest periods of a downturn that we had gone through we were only two years into a recovery maybe three when it started all over again it is not a typical cycle this decade has been particularly difficult
6647305 pittsburgh is a smaller city than it used to be so we need to be very efficient about finding resources and utilizing them
6647306 they enhance the reputation of the city and help bring in money too in allegheny county the pittsburgh arts industry is a 341 million regional business
6647307 an orchestra of the reputation and historical significance of pittsburgh adds so much value to a city it is an enticement for business and it spreads the name of the city internationally
6647308 the talks are cordial and we intend on coming on some sort of agreement
6647309 the question is how much benefit does having one of the world class orchestras so intrinsically recognized with your city what is that value to the city the message of an orchestra to its community has to be one of investing
6647310 i really miss doing as many interviews as i used to
6647311 i think theres something about the web vibe and i know that makes me sound very out of it to use the word vibe but im looking forward to being able to have more casual but hopefully hard hitting coverage if thats not too counter intuitive
6647312 a distinct venue to mix good food and lively political debate
6647313 its very ambitious and a huge commitment of resources i dont think by the end of fall anybody will be able to say cbs just talked about the polls and the candidates latest gaffes
6647314 talking to real people is one of my strong suits and hopefully this gives me a chance to get out its frustrating sometimes to be behind the desk all the time and not interacting with people and talking to them making people comfortable and guiding the interview and being a good listener
6647315 this will be an opportunity to do some of that
6647316 i want you to become frankenstein release the dreadnought were going to kill him of course
6647317 what excited him most about this adventure aside from being a beautiful show was that it was like a bank robbery and that pleased him enormously
6647318 if i die what a beautiful death to die in the exercise of your passion
6647319 we have some good linemen returning so the young skill players will have to step up for us to have success
6647320 he will anchor our defense and have to show vocal leadership
6647321 right now we are trying to develop some depth and im wondering how hungry the returnees are
6647322 this is the best group of kids ive had since ive been coaching
6647323 we have heard from other viewers concerning this issue and are working to provide hd service for preseason games in future seasons
6647324 we are committed to supporting and growing both the cbs television network and the cw network in the pittsburgh market
6647325 while the cbs network has a longer history and a larger following there are viewers who are extremely passionate about both networks programs we apologize for the disruption and appreciate the loyal viewership i can assure you that cws americas next top model and gossip girl viewers would react with the same passion as cbss big brother viewers
6647326 it looks like shes saying they were running out of boxes due to overwhelming demand for their upgraded service and new lower priced package so we in the north hills arent getting these upgrades because they dont want to run out of cable boxes that might be the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard heres an idea make the new customers wait for their box and give those of us who have been waiting forever for these channels what we want and have been paying a higher price for
6647327 it went very very smoothly and professionally the whale suffered as little as possible
6647328 i lost my sense of smell when i was in my early 20s so it affects my ability to really determine the nuances its like golfing for me i can only joke at it or cheat
6647329 beautiful corner office of this ancient stone facaded building with wine sitting on the table
6647330 we were sitting in the courtyard of chateau montelena watching a movie with scenes where trucks drive up to where youre sitting
6647331 thats the privilege of doing movies you get to drop into somebodys world i had to do it very fast my avenue in was more about the agriculture i found it fascinating
6647332 i have a ranch in montana with my brother and were raising hay in this very crude version of all that anybody whos involved with agriculture i think it takes a lot of humility and everything to make it all work they do it at such a refined level its fascinating
6647333 its amazing just the gentleness of the hills that nestle the valleys where the wineries are and the vineyards that roundly kind of lift away and up and down in these symmetrical configurations its a very very lucky corner of the world
6647334 nine years ago i thought to myself i dont really enjoy practicing law and i started writing scripts if i dont do something now its never going to happen
6647335 its a story that needs to be told and it cuts across generations and its something our generation doesnt know and its a great underdog story
6647336 maybe 40 minutes into the discussion jim barrett told me this crazy story about the wine he thumped his hands on the table and pushed his chair back and said ill tell you your movie and then he started telling me this weird story
6647337 when i was first writing it sideways had not come out yet
6647338 i said to my dad who is pretty good at judging american tastes by the way im writing this movie about wine and he said ross ill tell you i know you are really interested in it but i just dont see it
6647339 i want to show that wine is not this big stuffy hoity toity thing its fun and it tastes good
6647340 we have some holes to fill but we have a good nucleus of kids and we have a very strong junior class
6647341 what were looking at is him succeeding and being consistent and being a leader if he can do that then well be very successful this year and i believe he can do that that doesnt put a lot of weight on his shoulders other than him doing what he needs to do to run the football club
6647342 we want to have a multi diverse offense and the only way to do that is you have to be able to run the football too we believe we can throw we believe we can run and i dont know in which order in which week
6647343 we just have to have everybody mesh together i think the older kids have done a good job laying it out in from of the underclassmen
6647344 we have a really strong sophomore class when they were eighth graders they were undefeated
6647345 were not an overly big team but were not real small i think we have a lot of kids that ran run i think this is probably the best overall team speed weve had since ive been here
6647346 hes worked really hard in the off season and gotten a lot better
6647347 weve got some kids up from junior varsity that have been with us a few years
6647348 i dont really like to play freshmen on the varsity unless theyre ready and vauters is ready
6647349 i inherited a young team i had three sophomores and one freshman on the offensive line last year
6647350 last year was an experience year for our kids so this year were trying to refine it
6647351 theyre really really solid kids being the two anchors on the line theyre required to do a lot
6647352 we see a lot of run and shoot offenses in the wabash river conference were going to keep learning more and more about our defense
6647353 men det vet ju alla att man inte kan dricka motorolja
6647354 i have a strong bias for the open door policy that has served our community colleges well for 100 years
6647355 consistent with all other public higher education institutions in north carolina
6647356 its been caught up in the whole national immigration debate
6647357 like it was the most absurd notion shed ever heard
6647358 some of this might be overreacting to the recent dramatic increase in gasoline prices

6647387 john mccain afirma ca fundamentele economiei noastre sunt puternice insa cand a fost intrebat cate case poseda el a pierdut sirul si nu le a mai amintit raspunsul este sapte
6647388 dont you think its time to think about getting a full time job
6647389 we certainly are seeing more interest in full size suvs and trucks over the last several weeks
6647390 remember we are in our eighth week of declining fuel prices in the u s
6647391 in may we were selling one truck for every one car we sold at our dealers and we had never been one to one it was always three trucks to two cars
6647392 however in june when ford came out with employee pricing things changed my theory is when something is cheap enough people buy it we began to see the trend for sales go back more toward trucks
6647393 july was really something we had our best truck month in the pittsburgh region since august 2007 that really blew our minds so the incentives combined with the reduction in gas prices greatly increased our truck sales
6647394 last month when you saw gas prices going down a little we noticed that the price and value reductions for big cars and trucks slowed down also the increases in the residual value of small cars leveled off too they are still increasing but at a reduced rate
6647395 our experience has been that american consumers adapt pretty rapidly to fuel price spikes and higher fuel prices i think people were initially shocked and there were some people who reacted in knee jerk fashion and said hey i gotta get out of my suv or hey i dont want to spend 100 for a tank of gas now people are starting to have a more rational take on all of this
6647396 residual values a new vehicles projected value after 36 months for trucks and full sized suvs declined at about twice the rate at which they normally declined over the last few months that was very steep
6647397 now things are starting to level out again some suvs like chevy tahoe ford expedition and toyota land cruiser had dropped by as much as 25 or 30 percent over a six month period of time those residual values have now stabilized
6647398 you can see the wounds resurface and the pain re thinking the entire incident again and again going through it in their minds as theyre listening to this and discussing the report
6647399 difficult to go through sure it is but the professionalism of the job and so forth you move forward and you do what you have to do and you get through it
6647400 its kind of like when a family loses a father or mother you know you have a whole community who lost him its like a mother father figure frank was a good man

6647404 at first the drama was going to end at 120 episodes in the middle of november after that 20 30 episodes were added to end in the middle on december but another 10 episodes were added for an ending late december
6647405 we decided on this because we wanted the daily drama after yamd to start exactly on january first of 2009 also yamd is starting to pick up on its ratings

6647407 as per the order of the supreme head of the armed forces on friday august 22 at 6 00 am local time 02 00 gmt all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia
6647408 over the course of august 22 the retreat of all these forces in georgia will be completed
6647409 our draft resolution is a reconfirmation of the six point agreement and theres no territorial integrity in the six principles
6647410 we believe the six principles are clear and already implemented
6647411 we have a presence of so called russian peacekeeping forces at key georgian choke points that will control economic life it will control humanitarian activities thats why clarifications are so important
6647412 for all practical purposes military to military co operation had really already been ended with the russians
6647413 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6647414 asalnya 20 orang lalu jadi 50 orang lalu jadi membludak
6647415 sekali kali kita diundang ke gedung pakuan oleh ibu dani
6647416 majelis talim ini ingin lebih memfokuskan pada kegiatan sosial dan memang kegiatannya banyak masalah sosial makanya setiap enam bulan sekali kita selalu mengadakan donor darah kemaren saja pesertanya lebih dari 100 orang lalu kita juga mengadakan sunatan massal kemaren sekitar 99 anak dan kami menyediakan berbagai fasilitasnya kita juga memberikan santunan kepada korban gempa di jogja korban banjir di baleendah bahkan ketika tsunami di pangandaran kita terjun langsung untuk menyantuni para korban bersama dengan ibu dani dan pak dani sebagai gubernur pada waktu itu rencananya kita juga akan mengadakan program anak asuh tapi belum diverifikasi semua ini dapat terlaksana karena bantuan dari infak jamaah sendiri dan para donatur yang tidak lain adalah jamaah haji dan umroh qiblat tour
6647417 tetapi semenjak pergantian jabatan gubernur para jamaah jadi berkurang tidak seperti dulu sampai tempatnya tidak cukup
6647418 tidak sebenarnya masalah pergantian jabatan gubernur tidak mempengaruhi majelis talim ini
6647419 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6647420 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6647421 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6647422 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6647423 its not about looking for who was guilty in the past or among us were all responsible
6647424 we have to recover confidence in our institutions in our state in our country
6647425 agora o brasil vai com muita moral pro tie break

6647427 it was very difficult to get them out and to get them out alive
6647428 i still havent heard about my sons condition but the other boy is doing good
6647429 from the lowest ive ever been to now its just great
6647430 obviously he does not want to come out and be arrested
6647431 as we stand here i still absolutely believe that my client is innocent
6647432 why is it that every child that comes into contact with him is broken
6647433 so you got these incredible suggestive tainted interviews and who takes over the interviews the woman who has custody of the three children
6647434 i thought things would go the justice way but justice is fickle i guess
6647435 i honestly dont know why it went the way it did this is the first time ive heard all this stuff that the d a is putting out that is not my child
6647436 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6647437 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6647438 one of the biggest and most important battles of u s egg industry history
6647439 we are in a battle to save our industry we have to be united
6647440 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6647441 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6647442 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6647443 why are they going to go back to their country and pay someone to bring them over here again
6647444 i just try to ignore it and focus on what im going to do for the team
6647445 its definitely really frustrating to see somebody else out there in your spot and taking your reps
6647446 i mean in high school it was pretty much line up and go tackle somebody
6647447 i have a pass rush repertoire i can use im definitely getting molded into a well rounded player
6647448 i just needed to focus on all the little things making sure i got the right rest eating right lifting hard
6647449 the expectations i have set for myself were already pretty high
6647450 my wife is thai thats where i met her shes only been in the country for a month
6647451 chop up brains and tongue and throw all of that good stuff in there
6647452 the lesbian couple next door they simply like to argue passionately and theyre entirely nonviolent
6647453 im really pleased with that its really exciting i wont call it a surprise but its great news what hes doing
6647454 there were five doctors trying to convince me to have surgery after i told them i dont want it all this medical stuff
6647455 they were just doing their jobs but i remember telling them no i believe in god and im not going with the surgery
6647456 i dont know if ill last the whole game if its ready for that
6647457 maybe me and matt sedillo can tag team the first game or something im stunned i cant believe im here i could say i believed in myself and i knew it but thats not the case i would say god didnt answer my prayers he probably answered somebody elses but im happy with it there are so many people that prayed for me something had to happen
6647458 every year they try and go after him but hes been a good congressman and he keeps getting put back in
6647459 cant really change just because its a presidential election year
6647460 i think he has a very good rapport with people in the district hes one of them hes a local boy and that resonates
6647461 our fundraising is attributable that wherever vic goes people are excited
6647462 we hear over and over again that voters in the district just dont trust and they are ready for a new leader
6647463 at this point theyre putting on their lowest of the low candidates
6647464 i think youre only going to see in the future her numbers continue to grow to an area closer to where the district is
6647465 i have been given one moment from heaven as i am walking surrounded by night stars high above me make a wish under moonlight on my way home i remember only good days on my way home i remember only best days on my way home i can remember every new day i move in silence with each step taken snow falling round me like angels in flight far in the distance is my wish under moonlight on my way home i remember only good days on my way home i remember all the best days and on my way home i can remember every new day on my way home i remember all the good days
6647466 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
6647467 it failed because we needed 5 000 students to purchase it but only 1 500 students bought it
6647468 the problem was that it was in development as it was being marketed
6647469 i thought it was a pass to see plays if it meant bands i want to see would come to pullman i would have bought it
6647470 i wouldnt want to spend a lot of money if i dont even know the bands
6647471 everybody wanted to know who the artists were but artists couldnt be booked until the money was collected from the concert passes
6647472 it was an amazing concept and with proper planning we could have reached 5 000 people
6647473 in a lot of the buildings that we have the furniture was pretty old
6647474 some of it was original like in the stephenson towers and couldnt be moved it made the rooms feel smaller than they were
6647475 we think not only will they have a better experience but we will have perhaps a higher return rate to stephenson
6647476 one of the strengths of our housing system is that students have a lot of options in the different kinds of housing they want to live in
6647477 our hope is to complete all three towers by next summer so that the whole complex will be refurbished
6647478 she wants people to know that shes very upset and that she was only trying to run a business
6647479 whether or not charges are filed from anyones action remains to be seen and well be there if charges are filed
6647480 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
6647481 penyebab utama impor bbm yang besar yang mencapai 8 47 milar dollar as adalah tidak adanya grand design konsumsi yang dibuat pemerintah
6647482 dari proyeksi pemerintah yang besarnya 7 6 juta kiloliter konsumsi dapat ditekan sampai 3 42 juta kiloliter jika pemerintah membatasi konsumen minyak tanah
6647483 bisa saja dikarenakan ekspor dibatasi untuk kebutuhan dalam negeri atau bisa saja hasil produksi migas dari para kontraktor asing mulai diolah dan didistribusikan di dalam negeri
6647484 harga gas alam biasanya sudah ditentukan dalam kontrak walaupun dikatakan harga gas alam mengikuti harga minyak tetapi pergerakannya tidak sedinamis harga minyak
6647485 penolakannya bisa melalui saat pembahasan apbn karena jika apbn tahun ini ditolak pemerintah harus menggunakan apbn tahun sebelumnya
6647486 we were doing cpr while we were putting him on the operating table
6647487 the veins in the area are huge they drain all the blood from the leg and when they are lacerated they bleed tremendous amounts of blood
6647488 cups and cups of blood per minute or second for that matter

6647490 the governor believes its important to tout montana and one way he does that is by communicating the law was not designed to stop the governor from asking the people of montana to thank farmers and ranchers

6647494 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6647495 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6647496 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6647497 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6647498 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6647499 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6647500 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6647501 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6647502 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6647503 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6647504 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6647505 n o estamos acertando a marca o eles rodam muito n o t m posi o fixa e estamos nos complicando
6647506 o rbitro marcou o recuo mas eu n o fiz isso felizmente n o tomamos o gol agora temos de voltar com aten o para a segunda etapa e atacar mais
6647507 muito f cil quem est de fora reclamar eu quero ver vir aqui e jogar este gramado vergonhoso
6647508 it was a tremendous game to snap our losing streak and it went right down to the wire
6647509 we knew people were writing about it everywhere now we want to win a couple more
6647510 i just try to take care of things i can control
6647511 every guy in that room knows we can hit better
6647512 hes just one lucky man because very seldom do cars come back this way
6647513 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas

6647515 the second you second guess yourself is when things start to cause problems we have our ups and downs when it comes to being aggressive but its part of the learning process
6647516 it wasnt really a risky play when it comes to ending the inning i figured the closer i could get to home plate the better off the team would be
6647517 more than anything were throwing the ball better were pitching better here at home and thats a big part of it
6647518 they got some guys on the bases and made stuff happen we tried to do the same thing but couldnt get that hit
6647519 weve got to get ourselves back on the winning track right now and do whatever it takes to win ballgames we cant worry about what theyre doing or how it puts us in the standings weve got to win
6647520 maam if i get any closer to that fellah in front of me im gonna hafta buy him a drink
6647521 ah say ah say just what seems to be the mattah heah
6647522 im deciding whether to kill you myself or whether to announce over the pa that a racist redneck from kenner is in the house and its open season on racist rednecks
6647523 to hell with it lets just make something anyways since we have all this stuff already organized
6647524 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6647525 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6647526 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6647527 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6647528 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6647529 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6647530 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6647531 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6647532 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6647533 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6647534 quando criamos o prouni tinha um tipo de gente que fazia discurso assim contra o governo
6647535 a tinha um tipo de estudante daqueles que voc s sabem que vai para a reitoria querer bater no reitor
6647536 ah 18 alunos muita gente na sala de aula 18 alunos vai atrapalhar a educa o
6647537 eu digo todo dia governo para todos n o discrimino ningu m mas fa o como a minha m e se eu tiver um bife n o tem um filho mais bonito que vai comer sozinho n o todos v o dar uma lambidinha
6647538 a pol tica econ mica estabelecida neste pa s nos ltimos 40 anos fez gerar duas gera es de jovens sem oportunidades

6647540 se os jogadores da sele o ol mpica tivessem a mesma garra que os estudantes do prouni a gente teria agora que disputar medalha no domingo
6647541 ah as mulheres s o as mulheres por isso que eu sou cada vez mais mulher
6647542 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6647543 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6647544 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6647545 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6647546 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6647547 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6647548 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6647549 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6647550 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6647551 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6647552 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6647553 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6647554 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6647555 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6647556 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6647557 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6647558 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6647559 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6647560 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6647561 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6647562 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6647563 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6647564 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6647565 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6647566 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6647567 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6647568 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6647569 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6647570 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6647571 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6647572 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6647573 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6647574 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6647575 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6647576 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6647577 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6647578 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6647579 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6647580 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6647581 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6647582 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6647583 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6647584 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6647585 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6647586 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6647587 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6647588 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6647589 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6647590 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6647592 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6647593 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6647594 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6647595 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6647596 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6647597 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6647598 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6647599 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6647600 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6647601 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6647602 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6647603 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6647604 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6647605 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6647606 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6647607 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6647608 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6647609 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6647610 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6647611 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6647612 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6647613 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6647614 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6647615 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6647616 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6647617 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6647618 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6647619 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6647620 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6647621 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

6647646 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6647647 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6647648 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6647649 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6647650 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6647651 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6647652 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6647653 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6647654 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6647655 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6647656 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6647657 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6647658 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6647659 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6647660 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6647661 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6647662 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6647663 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6647664 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6647665 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6647666 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6647667 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6647668 das grundrecht auf informationelle selbstbestimmung hat seit 25 jahren eine enorme wirkung ohne dass es ausdr cklich im grundgesetz steht wir sollten acht geben dass wir unsere verfassung nicht mit reiner politischer symbolik berfrachten
6647669 i am not sure if this will affect him but the issue is the first thing you see on tv daily

6647683 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6647684 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6647685 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6647686 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6647687 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6647688 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6647689 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6647690 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6647691 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6647692 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6647693 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

6647695 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6647696 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6647697 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6647698 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6647699 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6647700 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6647710 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6647711 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6647712 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6647713 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6647714 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6647715 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

6647722 we could use more soul food in this neighborhood its a great location with all the retail around here
6647723 i absolutely would have checked it out its a shame
6647724 its really unfortunate especially with so many small businesses in fulton closing
6647725 its just one more store that didnt get to show how well it could do
6647726 it really helps to see the buildings and get a feel for the campus in person
6647727 that was really the only suspicious thing about the letter and our national headquarters advised out of an abundance of caution for our staff and volunteers that we have the authorities check it out
6647728 there were maybe a couple of grains of something inside an envelope and they had to kind of work to get a sample
6647729 its unusual to be asked what we are going to do ahead of a rate cut but on what we know today this is a pretty simple equation
6647730 if funding costs continue at the current levels and the reserve bank do actually cut rates then there will be a full flow on to our mortgage customers
6647731 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down
6647732 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision

6647745 only the tail was recognizable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area

6647766 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch everyone is living in fear
6647767 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class
6647768 they are a prime target because theyve got money and theyve got a worry and you can combine those two and offer them a false sense of security which is exactly what this is
6647769 at nearby green mountain college which has more business courses and more job counselors than does mira vista college 90 percent of last years graduating seniors had job offers from prospective employers but at mira vista college last year only 70 percent of the seniors who informed the placement office that they would be seeking employment had found full time jobs within three months after graduation and only half of these graduates were employed in their major field of study to help mira vistas graduates find employment we must offer more courses in business and computer technology and hire additional job counselors to help students with their resum s and interviewing skills
6647770 jim greenwood never dreamed his hoa would have a problem with his new pickup after all about 30 percent of all texans drive similar vehicles
6647771 mr greenwood youre violating a subdivision rule that prohibits pickup trucks in your driveway
6647772 its hard to imagine how an hoa would try to dictate what type of vehicle you can drive and park in your driveway
6647773 the high end vehicles that are allowed are plush with amenities and covers on the back
6647774 the response was its our belief that lincoln markets to a different class of people
6647775 furthermore one board member told my wife that if we dont like it we can move
6647776 a chevy suburban can be in the driveway if we had a big hummer that could be the driveway if we had a lincoln mark lt that could be in the driveway but a ford f 150 cant that doesnt make sense greenwood said

6647789 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6647790 so far everything that has been received demonstrates we have no problem for the eligibility of the competitors
6647791 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6647792 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6647793 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6647794 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6647795 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6647796 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition

6647802 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6647803 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6647804 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together

6647807 we know the sale of shar hich these demand in practice
6647808 i have some follow up questions but after spending a week transcribing that interview id rather do the rest of the talking by email because im too short on time to do that again
6647809 ill check out the new presentation the story will run a week from next thursday
6647810 the pentacon includes no evidence of anything whatsoever just a lot of questions and innuendo set to an ominous hip hop beat
6647811 when he first saw the passenger jet descending too low and too fast over the potomac river
6647812 walter chatted casually with the pair and at one point he realized that ranke was surreptitiously tape recording the conversation
6647813 they were saying things like are you sure the plane didnt land at reagan airport and they set off a bomb they kept coming up with all these scenarios
6647814 the citizens investigative team sic claims to have obtained undeniable evidence that what happened at the pentagon on sept
6647815 pause for circus music a magic trick in which a military plane painted to resemble an american airlines jet flew low over the pentagon while explosives took down a wall of the structure in a convenient cloud of smoke thus allowing the plane to fly away and secretly land somewhere presumably at nearby reagan national airport unfortunately their film the pentacon doesnt provide any evidence of this
6647816 the fact that all those eyewitnesses and many more believe they saw the jet hit the pentagon which happens to be the official version of what happened that day as well as the accepted truth among most conspiracy bother ranke and marquis
6647817 the evidence they say proves all those witnesses actually saw something else another jet flown by an unknown military pilot soaring just over the roof of the pentagon while explosives planted by government operatives
6647818 many conspiracy theorists like avery and pickering are no longer on speaking terms with ranke and marquis
6647819 thats when ranke heard the cell phone calls placed by terrified passengers on the planes that hit the towers
6647820 one of their first stops was walters fairfax virginia home after noticing rankes not so subtle effort to secretly tape record their conversation and realizing that ranke and marquis werent interested in hearing anything that contradicted their notion that a plane didnt actually hit the building he refused to submit an interview
6647821 i know you are not out to character assassinate me ive never once presumed that and if i did think that clearly i never would have invited you into my home i would never presume to think that craig and aldo are out to get me either i bear no grudges or hard feelings towards anyone i just responded to some of the stuff that has been written about me on the internet that i am aware of i have no idea who wrote these things quite frankly i dont care
6647822 where some might find contradictory eyewitness accounts a normal outcome of an intense traumatic event marquis and ranke view any eyewitness statement placing the plane on the north side of the gas station as clear evidence that the ntsb data is phony and further proof that the military was behind 9 11
6647823 he still believes that 9 11 was an inside job but pickering strongly disagrees with ranke and marquis fly over theory which isnt supported by a single eyewitness
6647824 ranke and marquis also interviewed several arlington national cemetery employees after receiving permission to bring cameras to the facility
6647825 why is he more concerned with our grammar than his own accuracy or bothering to validate or refute the evidence
6647826 how witnesses who saw a second plane high in the skies above the pentagon could possibly be part of a conspiracy to fool the public into thinking that a plane nobody saw fly over the pentagon actually crashed into a building is a question that is as ridiculously convoluted and inherently illogical as the very theory embraced by marquis and ranke
6647827 norm promotion this includes advertising sales promotion publicity and personal selling branding and over the past fifteen years a whole science of marketing analytics and marketing effectiveness has b ince they want entrants to interact with the online presentation at the prize sponsors websites th accounts from 4 mb to 1 gb and all yahoo mail plus accounts to 2 gb
6647828 the greatest benefits and least risk from hrt are seen in the 99 percent of women who commence hrt for symptom relief near menopause this trial studied much older women who started hrt on average 13 to 14 years after menopause when they had fewer symptoms even in this group improved quality of life was seen in many taking hrt
6647829 i think this is an important study because since whi many have lost sight of the significant benefits of hormone therapy
6647830 this study reinforces the notion that for women with these symptoms hrt can improve your quality of life and the worse your symptoms the more theyll improve

6647874 its unusual to be asked what we are going to do ahead of a rate cut but on what we know today this is a pretty simple equation anz chief executive mike smith said
6647875 if funding costs continue at the current levels and the reserve bank do actually cut rates then there will be a full flow on to our mortgage customers

6647884 but when i got elected to the executive board of the players association i told gene i need you to be the player rep
6647885 because i saw those qualities that other people hadnt seen i knew right away that gene had the leadership and qualities to be a leader on and off the football field thats why we picked him as one of the captains of the team
6647886 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6647887 when i think about gene upshaw i think about no 63 pulling
6647888 a lot of people called it highway 63 thats what i remember and i know about gene because when he pulled around that left side he got in like a hurricane coming through wiped out everything that was there
6647889 gene was tough he just felt he couldnt get beat he had the determination to be the very best and when we drafted him mr davis knew that he would be the very best
6647890 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6647891 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6647892 a guy like delamielleure says the things he said about me you think im going to invite him to dinner no im going to break his damn neck
6647893 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6647894 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6647895 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6647896 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game in the big picture
6647897 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man gene upshaws career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy we loved him and he loved us we will miss him our hearts go out to terri and the boys
6647898 in seeking balance rejecting the notion that they must makes either or choices in their lives women are also rejecting the idea that life is a zero sum game where spending time on a career necessarily means being less involved at home instead of finding that one choice replaces another one choice can enhance another
6647899 choose between gaining additional moderate amounts of time or of money women picked more time by nearly two to one
6647900 humans as a species are not biologically equipped for the large number of choices we currently face
6647901 found that women generally express high levels of confidence in the direction their lives are moving and in their ability to make choices that best meet their needs
6647902 anticipatory marketing which requires having enough insight into a womans life to fulfill her future needs without having to ask her for a blueprint
6647903 taking the needs of women into account when designing the physical shopping environment adapting it to reflect the desires of women customers not waiting for women to identify problems or trouble spots
6647904 today theres an emotional connection with style its the thing that moves women to buy purchases are less about conspicuous consumption and keeping up with the joneses and more about how they make women feel the emotional reward
6647905 feeling in control is integral to a womans overall sense of well being extending far beyond her psychological health and directly affecting many aspects of her physical health we live in a hectic and often confusing world where much seems beyond our control so it is little wonder that women are looking for practical help in areas of their lives where they can exert real influence
6647906 we are creating and sustaining our homes in new ways discovering emotional links between the abstract idea of home and the material things it contains

6647909 i think as a core segment of our business residential development could grow to be up to 20 percent of our revenue we certainly see it rising significantly as more projects come online in the future
6647910 we are looking at this from time to time because of the brand names we control
6647911 furthermore as people begin to appreciate branded residential developments we have an advantage because we are used to operating branded hotels i think therefore that you could see more branded residences begin to occur
6647912 internationally we could certainly look at residential in africa and in the indian ocean sri lanka when peace comes will also be a very promising destination in mauritius seychelles and madagascar we are looking at hotel developments and as a result of this we are also looking at residential developments
6647913 physically merge the multiple institutions that have come together in recent years to form the autry national center

6647915 an additional 30 000 sq ft of underground storage at the griffith park campus will securely house the remainder of the southwests collection
6647916 the southwests cramped buildings in mt washington dating to 1914 have deteriorated to a point that threatens the museums holdings relocating the southwest museum to griffith park will result in more than five times the current gallery space to showcase a collection of native american art and artifacts that is considered one of the largest and most significant in the world
6647917 in griffith park approximately 50 000 sq ft of the master plan will be dedicated to the institute for the study of the american west with large spaces for the autry library and the collections of the braun library which is currently located at the mt washington site

6647938 i just saw the plight of people using the trains to get to work every morning they were jostling to get on board every time a train arrived there appeared to be no system
6647939 im not happy with this because the people are not getting satisfaction from riding the trains this we must fix

6647946 knowing which products are most affected by a recession can guide effective strategic decisions with regard to pricing promotion and assortment tactics
6647947 for products that are performing strong and showing immunity during a recession manufacturers and retailers in these industries have the opportunity to increase product exposure even further for products at the other end of the spectrum companies would be well advised to target their marketing efforts to shore up performance and maintain traction during tough times
6647948 both of the characters have been there for each other when they really needed one another

6647951 after recently being asked by the england management to reassess my retirement from international one day cricket ive decided to join englands squad for the natwest series after careful consideration

6647953 the trading environment is worse than yesterday as the yen became stronger and oil prices rose sharply

6647956 i threw away my vote on ron paul just on impulse knowing he couldnt win
6647957 but i think obama would have a lot of trouble with the politicians who have been around for a while
6647958 that depends on how big fannie and freddie blow up
6647959 the problem is weve got questions we dont have answers
6647960 theres not protection for shareholders of common or preferred shares
6647961 even if any rescue effort gives a priority to the federal government that still makes fannie and freddie more solvent
6647962 while some companies will probably have some write downs i dont think theres a widespread effect on the whole industry

6647967 a spiderweb of corruption has penetrated many parts of our department
6647968 now operate in drug trafficking kidnapping and money laundering among other things with no central control or any one gang dominating any of the criminal activities
6647969 that is why kidnapping has grown more competitive with kidnappers using much more violence against each other and against the victims in a bid to gain territory markets or dominance
6647970 it is clear that the public is indignant is angry and it has a right to be
6647971 while important members of the business community and seiu participated in good faith discussions it was unfortunately not possible to achieve a compromise acceptable to a sufficient portion of the business community and the proponents to cause its removal from the ballot we regret that a reasonable compromise was not possible this reality means that there will be a hard fought campaign centering on this initiative in the coming months during that campaign we call upon both sides to avoid portraying ohio as unfriendly to business and economic development we also recognize it is important to make clear our thoughts on important public policy issues and today are announcing that we cannot support the paid sick day ballot initiative while we would hope that all ohio businesses would make paid sick days available to their employees whenever possible we believe that this initiative is unworkable unwieldy and would be detrimental to ohios economy and we will be opposing it and asking ohioans to oppose it as a result

6647977 the apes are jews the people of the sabbath while the swine are christians the infidels of the communion of jesus
6647978 fighting infidels until they either convert to islam or submit to muslims as dhimmis is still considered by islamists to be a religious duty
6647979 the militants believe that controlling one country will rally the muslim masses enabling them to overthrow all moderate governments in the region and establish a radical islamic empire that spans from spain to indonesia

6647984 there will be continuing enmity until everyone believes in allah we will not meet the enemy halfway and there will be no room for dialogue with them
6647985 islam does not coincide or make a truce with unbelief but rather confronts it the confrontation that islam calls for with these godless and apostate regimes does not know socratic debates platonic ideals nor aristotelian diplomacy but it knows the dialogue of bullets the ideals of assassination bombing and destruction and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine gun

6647992 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6647993 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6647994 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6647995 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6647996 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6647997 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6647998 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6647999 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6648000 meine mutter sagte er solle aussteigen aber sie haben ihn nicht gelassen er sollte sich hinsetzen sie w rden in f nf minuten starten
6648001 he and i became really good friends we were there in the tough times in the good times too
6648002 he is really going to be missed in the nfl and by football generally
6648003 obviously life moves on but i dont know that anybody can replace gene upshaw
6648004 the games the most important thing and thats what youre trying to protect
6648005 he saw that and i saw that with him we just started that and as you do with friendship youre with people for a time when i had my 50th wedding anniversary he and his wife terry came we had that kind of relationship
6648006 he came to my fathers and my mothers funerals we were pretty close
6648007 i played against him when i was with the houston oilers and he was with the raiders he was a great player his leadership will be missed by all in the nfl
6648008 i think overall for the players you can throw darts at gene all over the board but he did far more than anybody who ever started in this business free agency and where the system is is far better than any player ever imagined

6648010 when you read media accounts at what online advertising is doing they are very downcast
6648011 the truth is if you look at the numbers they are not all true
6648012 the logic is that most of the growth in internet advertising comes from money that has been spent in other media before
6648013 when you have economic downturn like now the advertisers look at how they can save money
6648014 the first call is going to be to the marketing department
6648015 a lot of it is remnant its going to be inventory that is not very effective

6648024 if everybody treated everybody the way they wanted to be treated the world would be a better place
6648025 we want to know if there is any pattern or any common cause
6648026 these are your questions and believe me these are our questions
6648027 screening levels are set very low to ensure that they are health protective
6648028 found that even if a worker was on site over a 25 year working lifetime the concentrations of lead and arsenic were low enough that no adverse health effects would be expected
6648029 i cant say i have ever heard of anything like that
6648030 i doubt that there is such an ordinance in the top 200 cities in the united states
6648031 instead what this ordinance does is try to micromanage a problem that would be best left to the professional staff

6648035 they said that the format of the show was that they were going from city to city finding the iconic food of each city and profiling the person who was best known for that iconic food
6648036 and these people have no idea what a village theyre coming to film in
6648037 i was just starting to make gumbo with everyone there assembled and all of a sudden i feel somebody standing next to me and its bobby flay
6648038 i must admit i wasnt entirely on my most stellar behavior
6648039 and i said bobby flay and i looked at the director and said i guess i got punked by the food network
6648040 i said to the director tell me now whats going to happen next is the back door going to fly open and food network personality paula deen is going to come through
6648041 bobby looks at me and says actually poppy i heard you make a really great gumbo and i was wondering are you ready for a throw down
6648042 the basic premise is they find some person who is well known for a certain dish and then bobby develops a recipe that he is going to use in essence in a contest with the person and then they ambush the person
6648043 ill tell you something else thats extremely indicative of the basic obsession here about all things new orleans and not things like the food network i would say that out of the 40 people there maybe 10 or less recognized him or knew who he was
6648044 ive since seen other throwdown episodes and the people practically genuflect when he comes out its the great bobby flay thats new orleans for you
6648045 it was a lovely seafood soup and i told him that
6648046 they were kind to me i have seen horrible things done to people in the episodes ive seen since they have them make humiliating faux commercials for a show that they believe is going to be their show on the food network i mean really
6648047 the message they allowed me to get across is that we are open for business and we are looking for our visitors its really sort of a little new orleans travel piece and it comes out good for us all and thats what counts in the end
6648048 whats the point of a roll call it is a distraction that takes away from the crowning moment for our nominee
6648049 anything that detracts from that message is a problem for us in the fall
6648050 he needs to illustrate his complete narrative and tell his personal story as americas story so that when he speaks about values responsibility hard work and opportunity they are his values and americas values
6648051 then people will see that the struggles they are facing are the struggles hes faced
6648052 there were spots with nobody on and i have to be more aggressive theyre obviously good hitters but if they hit the ball out of the park its only a solo home run and i can go after the next guy
6648053 those are some big situations and obviously that team can hit so you dont want to make a mistake i might have been too fine thats why i made so many pitches but youve got to be tough with those guys

6648115 permiso municipal de conductor a favor de vecino de abegondo con domicilio en cerneda en abegondo a 2 de junio de 1993
6648116 por ello se pide encarecidamente a cualquier vecino que pueda estar circulando con veh culos autom viles con autorizaciones que no sean expedidas por las autoridades en materia de tr fico se abstengan de circular por las v as p blicas de este t rmino municipal
6648117 aunque el uso de este tipo de pruebas todav a no se ha generalizado s es cierto que en los ltimos tiempos estamos despachando m s envases que hace dos o tres a os cuando empezaron a comercializarse en toda espa a
6648118 no s lo nos los piden padres de adolescentes sino tambi n los de j venes algo m s entrados en a os que incluso rondan la treintena
6648119 cuando los padres hacen la prueba sin el consentimiento expreso de sus hijos lo habitual es que utilicen una muestra de sudor en vez de orina
6648120 bastar a con pasar los marcadores por la ropa sudada de los chavales antes de meterla en la lavadora
6648121 sta es una herramienta m s para los padres que est n preocupados por las compa as de sus hijos que ltimamente salen m s y han cambiado de actitud en casa
6648122 nos acusaban de convertir a los padres en polic as de romper la comunicaci n con sus hijos pero nosotros creemos que m s bien ayuda a restablecerla

6648153 they sat down on a bed with me and mr chambers son brian stood around him and told us they had to do the operation as the aneurysm had reached a certain size

6648156 pedimos un esfuerzo por parte de la xunta para que se obtengan licencias en asturias y los barcos que llevamos viniendo muchos a os a faenar podamos seguir haci ndolo y sin presiones de las autoridades
6648157 los pescadores asturianos se niegan a que haya m s permisos de pesca y que otros barcos les quiten parte del mercado
6648158 los mayoristas asturianos se han reunido con los responsables de pesca del principado para solicitar que se nos concedan las licencias y les han dicho que esta semana o en la pr xima les contestar n no tenemos muchas esperanzas y si la respuesta es negativa nos marcharemos de aqu porque no podemos seguir en esta situaci n
6648159 esperamos que la xunta haga algo esta vez porque hasta ahora no se ha interesado mucho sino esto ya estar a solucionado lo m s dif cil de entender es que en avil s hay cinco cerqueros y el gobierno asturiano hace caso de lo que ellos dicen pero aqu que somos 180 barcos de cerco nadie atiende nuestras demandas

6648172 i think mark paschall now realizes that a police state is a very real concern in america which is quite a turnaround for a very conservative republican
6648173 this case demonstrates the incredible power the state has to ruin the lives of citizens
6648174 our society has given far too much power to prosecutors the only thing that separates this country from iran or china is the jury system this was a huge eye opening for mark paschall

6648220 w hrend der vergangenen herbstkonferenz der innenminister wurde zwischen senator ehrhart k rting und dessen damaligem hamburger amtskollegen nagel die absprache getroffen kollegen nach berlin zur ckholen zu wollen
6648221 man darf bei der diskussion nicht au er acht lassen dass die vom land berlin ausgebildeten 502 beamten von hamburg als vollwertige vollzugsbeamte bernommen wurden ohne dass die hansestadt sich wenigstens anteilig an den kosten f r diese ausbildung beteiligt h tte dass herr glietsch sich jetzt auch vielleicht gegen die meinung einzelner mitarbeiter f r das anschreiben entschlossen hat ist aufgrund dieser grundlage durchaus nachvollziehbar
6648222 es gibt bereits ger chte wonach ein bestimmtes bundesland einer vielzahl von bewerbern f r den gehobenen dienst empfohlen hat sich mangels eigener ausbildungsm glichkeiten in berlin zum polizisten schulen zu lassen um nach erfolgreichem durchlauf der ausbildung in das eigene land zur ckzukehren
6648223 somit w rde das finanzielle ruinierte berlin die polizeiausbildung anderer bundesl nder finanzieren ohne selbst davon profitieren zu k nnen
6648224 polizeipr sident glietsch kann auch nur die stellen besetzen und die geh lter zahlen die ihm von der politik bewilligt werden das land hamburg hat davon profitiert dass wir keine freien stellen hatten die hansestadt hat 500 gute beamte quasi auf dem silbertablett serviert bekommen
6648225 wenn hamburg uns nun davon nur sieben zur ckgeben will ist es nur clever vom pr sidenten weitere zu k dern zumal es sich bei den 21 betroffenen um kollegen handelt die ernste gr nde f r eine r ckkehr haben
6648226 verh ngnisvolle eigendynamik entwickelt die es vielleicht bei einem pers nlichen treffen so nicht gegeben h tte

6648236 es una decisi n del entrenador y del presidente tambi n estaban detr s de un central y parece que no se ficha a nadie record aqu hay buenos jugadores pero en defensa siempre viene bien tener un futbolista que pueda aportar veteran a aunque los chavales de la cantera tambi n est n aportando juventud y ganas

6648242 hes not there yet as compared with where he was when he was with us early in the year but thats to be expected because he hasnt been out there that many times he just looked crisp to me
6648243 he was throwing pitches on both sides of the plate for strikes

6648259 we had no personal assets of any significance in 1981 and still have none we do not own a home we do not have an investment retirement savings accounts
6648260 the irs has conducted itself in a disgusting manner with arrogant disregard for the moral ethical and legal standards that no office of government should be above
6648261 you cant be serious how a comedian became the most influential voice in american politics
6648262 when jon stewart inaugurated his fake news anchor on the daily show eight years ago his goal was to send up the hyperbolic and manufactured controversy of us cable news and if possible be even more outrageous
6648263 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6648264 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6648265 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6648266 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6648267 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6648268 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6648269 this is certainly a serious blow to the sport and we are well aware of the possible implications for the sport and its position in the olympics
6648270 the four cases tested positive for the same substance i dont know if we can say its a trend but it contributes to the seriousness of the case
6648271 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6648272 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6648273 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6648274 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6648275 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6648276 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6648277 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6648278 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6648279 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

6648313 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6648314 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6648315 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6648316 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6648317 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6648318 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6648319 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6648320 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6648321 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6648322 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6648323 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6648324 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6648325 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6648326 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6648327 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6648328 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6648329 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6648330 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6648331 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6648332 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6648333 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6648334 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6648335 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6648336 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6648337 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6648338 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6648339 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6648340 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6648341 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6648342 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6648343 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6648344 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6648345 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6648346 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6648347 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6648348 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6648349 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6648350 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6648351 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6648352 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6648353 they should put their eyes out so they cant commit any more crimes
6648354 prison isnt a solution anymore they just form their own gangs inside prison and come out stronger
6648355 if they cant they should resign but they should not keep occupying government offices and getting paid to do nothing
6648356 a spiderweb of corruption has penetrated many parts of our department
6648357 that is why kidnapping has grown more competitive with kidnappers using much more violence against each other and against the victims in a bid to gain territory markets or dominance

6648364 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6648365 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6648366 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community

6648372 maka rasulullah saw pun berdiri dan terdiam lalu berdoa kepada allah swt agar menolongnya maka allah swt memberitahu muhammad saw agar mengarahkan telunjuknya ke bulan rasulullah pun mengarahkan telunjuknya ke bulan dan terbelahlah bulan itu dengan sebenar benarnya maka serta merta orang orang musyrik pun berujar muhammad engkau benar benar telah menyihir kami akan tetapi para ahli mengatakan bahwa sihir memang benar bisa saja menyihir orang yang ada disampingnya akan tetapi tidak bisa menyihir orang yang tidak ada ditempat itu mereka lantas menunggu nunggu orang orang yang akan pulang dari perjalanan orang orang quraisy pun bergegas menuju keluar batas kota mekkah menanti orang yang baru pulang dari perjalanan dan ketika datang rombongan yang pertama kali dari perjalanan menuju mekkah maka orang orang musyrik pun bertanya apakah kalian melihat sesuatu yang aneh dengan bulan

6648376 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6648377 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6648378 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6648379 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

6648383 es casi imposible salvarse con el 90 del cuerpo quemado
6648384 first i want to get divorced second i want to go to school again but i dont know the third thing
6648385 i have nightmares that he comes to mums flat and stabs me in the heart
6648386 d nde estaba su padre y cu ndo terminaba la pel cula
6648387 me preguntaba si era verdad lo que estaba ocurriendo y lo que estaba pasando
6648388 cre a que se trataba de una pel cula y preguntaba constantemente cu ndo terminaba y d nde estaba su padre
6648389 e incluso uno de ellos estaba sentado en el amasijo de hierros
6648390 no quer an saltar por el fuego y el desconcierto
6648391 we condemn unreservedly the acts of violence committed against innocent civilians in mindanao this week
6648392 as a direct result i deeply regret that many uk and other international volunteers have had to leave iligan city and at least temporarily curtail their livelilhood services in muslim and christian communities in lanao
6648393 the philippine government has assured me this week that they would value visits from northern ireland to discuss such issues as decommissioning of arms as well as the political process
6648394 as northern ireland demonstrated clearly international involvement and support can help tip discussions towards a peace agreement
6648395 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6648396 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6648397 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6648398 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6648399 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6648400 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6648401 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6648402 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school
6648403 i want somebody who shares with me a passion to make the lives of the american people better than they are right now
6648404 i want somebody who is mad right now that people are losing their jobs
6648405 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6648406 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6648407 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6648408 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6648409 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6648410 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6648411 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6648412 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6648413 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6648414 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6648415 this is a planning took where all things are going
6648416 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6648417 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6648418 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6648419 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6648420 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6648421 well theres evolution for instance one idea is that before people there were other animals on earth like monkeys over time the monkeys changed little bit by little bit becoming more and more like people eventually after a really long time the monkeys were more like people than monkeys those were the first people
6648422 there are other ways of looking at it though you see people have been trying to answer that question for a really long time so over the years different stories have been made up to help explain where the first people came from a story that explains where people came from and how the earth was made is called a creation myth just about every religion on earth has its own idea of where we came from its own creation myth the christian religion believes that god made the first people he made a man and a woman named adam and eve and they were the first people
6648423 i think the first people were made by a bear
6648424 oh i like this little boy named jeremy hes soooo dreamy
6648425 were not sure why he left other than he was upset that he was not getting cooperation
6648426 sticking our head in the sand under the banner of no new taxes or no new fees is i think both irresponsible and a formula for failure
6648427 like it or not were not going to get out of the hole that were in just by shuffling around the current money
6648428 samir cukup rajin dan bisa menunjukkan akselerasi permainan yang bagus visinya terhadap pertandingan juga bagus dan berada di sisi kiri sepertinya cocok untuknya
6648429 bisa jadi ada sedikit unsur pires dalam dirinya karena ia sepertinya mudah sekali mengganti arah serangan dan cara berlarinya juga sedikit sama badan nasri memang lebih kecil tapi ada sedikit pires di dalamnya
6648430 mungkin sekarang ini saya sedikit terlalu jujur dan di klub manajer memberitahu saya untuk tidak terlalu banyak bertahan untuk mencoba menyimpan lebih banyak energi saat kami menyerang
6648431 kadang anda hanya ingin merebut kembali bola dan bekerja keras untuk tim begitulah cara saya bermain
6648432 jika saya berhasil memenanginya saya akan mendedikasikan sukses saya kepada rafa dia adalah orang yang sangat penting dalam kehidupan saya saya berdoa kepada tuhan agar saya bisa memenangi sebuah medali emas untuk liverpool
6648433 keadaan terlihat baik buat luca kami berharap dia akan kembali hari sabtu nanti dan semuanya akan terlihat berbeda lagi
6648434 saya sudah tiga kali bikin gol lawan mereka dan mungkin saya bisa menambah satu atau dua lagi sabtu nanti
6648435 my one fear is that someone would interpret it any other way than he was less than a perfect fit for surry county
6648436 the board of county commissioners appreciates macons four and a half years of service to the county but the county has chosen to pursue new leadership
6648437 i cannot comment about the matter further due to personnel laws
6648438 i think the main issue is that it has nothing to do with his character or any major issues
6648439 dear lord i do not ask that thou shouldst give me some high work of thine some noble calling or some wondrous task give me a little hand to hold in mine
6648440 im going to leave now that ive made a complete spectacle of myself by shouting at the top of my lungs
6648441 you like me gross what the fuck is wrong with you
6648442 11 year old boys do not like it when their mothers cry

6648450 el reino de los cielos se parece a un rey que celebraba las bodas de su hijo envi entonces a sus servidores para avisar a los invitados pero estos se negaron a ir de nuevo envi a otros servidores con el encargo de decir a los invitados mi banquete est preparado ya han sido matados mis terneros y mis mejores animales y todo est a punto vengan a las bodas pero ellos no tuvieron en cuenta la invitaci n y se fueron uno a su campo otro a su negocio y los dem s se apoderaron de los servidores los maltrataron y los mataron al enterarse el rey se indign y envi a sus tropas para que acabaran con aquellos homicidas e incendiaran su ciudad luego dijo a sus servidores el banquete nupcial est preparado pero los invitados no eran dignos de l salgan a los cruces de los caminos e inviten a todos los que encuentren los servidores salieron a los caminos y reunieron a todos los que encontraron buenos y malos y la sala nupcial se llen de convidados cuando el rey entr para ver a los comensales encontr a un hombre que no ten a el traje de fiesta amigo le dijo c mo has entrado aqu sin el traje de fiesta el otro permaneci en silencio entonces el rey dijo a los guardias atenlo de pies y manos y arr jenlo afuera a las tinieblas all habr llanto y rechinar de dientes porque muchos son llamados pero pocos son elegidos
6648451 i dont know if its our immediate future its something we talk about every few months
6648452 having children is something we would never take lightly and just say that would be fun
6648453 its a lot of work and we recognize that in a way we want to be selfish because we love our life but we know how much that adds to it
6648454 if they would be as pretty as brad and angelinas kids we might
6648455 matter of life and death is great time runs quickly nothing remains it waits for no man you should not waste your time

6648457 if all of the christans in europe would convert to judaism just until the persecution is over then the nazis would not be able to kill any more jews

6648474 observed no arthritic changes to the left elbow and his ligament was intact
6648475 we were pleased by the report that there was not a significant injury to the elbow or shoulder that would prevent tom from pitching in the future
6648476 the bottom line is that air gun noise from seismic surveys that are thousands of yards distant does not drive away sperm whales living in the gulf
6648477 however some individual whales feeding at depth reduced the rate at which they searched acoustically for their prey when scientists carried out controlled exposure experiments by bringing seismic surveys close by the whales
6648478 as a result the oil and gas industry has agreed to a best practice attitude that seismic surveys should shut down temporarily when towed air guns come within one third of a mile of whales or groups of whales in the gulf

6648480 whatever the price we have to fix the relationship between georgia and russia for two centuries we have lived together
6648481 georgia was a russian colony for more than 200 years but this is the 21st century the time for colonies is over georgia now has the strong support of the outside world
6648482 you know what mistake the russian leadership is making when they say they dont want to deal with saakashvili that he should resign and only when there is a new president they will start a new conversation with georgia previously when the military campaign in tskhinvali failed and georgians subjected saakashvili to serious criticism most of the people were against the president but when russia began to ask for his resignation most of the people began to support him it is the georgian nature you have to understand

6648555 how do the results of this brochure fit into the entire campaign
6648556 how can these results be strengthened with other forms of promotional materials
6648557 you cannot in this day and age give up a month or a week
6648558 while the republican convention went on he was picking judges for western massachusetts
6648559 and the lesson was an election can be lost in august
6648560 the candidate usually keeps a low profile during the opposition convention certainly bush did in 2004
6648561 the polls are tightening youre seeing a sharper tone out of barack obama
6648562 we think he recognizes that theres a shift in this race and that the republican party independents and conservative democrats have recognized that john mccain is the candidate and the leadership that we need in the next four years
6648563 hes taken obama down a peg and he doesnt want to overplay that hand
6648564 when does the government plan to unveil details on this grant which is supposed to be implemented starting with the upcoming 08 09 academic year how will the grant be managed will students be required to qualify for osap in order to receive the grant if not how will students not receiving osap apply for the grant will ontario residents attending a public pse institution outside of the province receive the grant will students be required to purchase textbooks from college university bookstores if so what steps has the government taken to ensure colleges and universities do not increase textbook prices in response to the increased business will students be able to apply the grant to used textbooks
6648565 details on the textbook and technology grant along with the application form will be released in early september
6648566 the 2008 budget announced this initiative as one measure to help lower costs for students approximately 380 000 full time university students and 170 000 full time college students will benefit annually with a grant of 150 per student this fall increasing to 225 per student in fall 09 and to 300 in subsequent years
6648567 what message do you have for students unsure if their textbook purchases will qualify for the grant are there any restrictions on how they spend their grant is it an automatic credit that every full time student will get without any receipts
6648568 all of the details on the textbook and technology grant will be coming to students in september
6648569 the primary thrust of my question is to inform my readership of what not to do if they wish to receive the grant is it possible for students to forfeit this grant by purchasing from an unauthorized retailer
6648570 we will be providing all necessary information to students in september along with the application form may i suggest you wait to inform your readers about the grant until such time as we can provide you with accurate information about how this grant works
6648571 it is our hope that this information will be available asap to inform students
6648572 we want to make sure that all ontario students take full advantage of these new grants to better assist them in affording postsecondary education
6648573 theyve had ample time to figure this out this was the only gift for post secondary students in the budget they need to know how to access it
6648574 wed rather see a reduction in tuition the biggest upfront cost students face is tuition
6648575 increased and new forms of assistance for the students of ontario is welcome by ousa and we hope to continue to work with stakeholders and government to make sure that the provision of better and more effective assistance is always a short term goal
6648576 we are concerned and disappointed that sufficient information regarding the distribution and application process for the grant has not been made available to ontario students
6648577 ousa hoped that this grant would be used by every eligible student but the school year is looming ever closer and we have not seen the government unveil a firm plan on how they will be approaching students and informing them on how to apply and benefit from the program
6648578 unfortunately weve been receiving inquiries about the grant from our readers and with students already purchasing textbooks we feel it necessary to run a story informing students where things stand on this grant it was announced in the budget back in march ive waited for the announcement of details since then
6648579 i assume you will be careful to relay the facts ive provided and avoid making assumptions about how the grant will work
6648580 they were efficient in their announcement of the grant and have been deficient in their implementation
6648581 theyve had five months to work out the little details this is unacceptable
6648582 this is the only grant for students in the budget and the government seems to be trying to discourage students from taking advantage of it
6648583 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
6648584 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
6648585 there arent too many authors of note who have passed through l a in the last three decades whom connie hasnt interviewed and interviewed well
6648586 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students
6648587 digitizing these tapes will give students and others an opportunity to hear and watch these outstanding authors for themselves whenever they want
6648588 seeing authors up close like this provides a rich point of view to their work
6648589 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion
6648590 in fact drucker once described management books as dreadful trash and suggested that he derived much of his philosophy from novelists such as austen balzac and others
6648591 is a beautiful setting for the tapes to call home
6648592 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6648593 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6648594 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6648595 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6648596 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6648597 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6648598 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6648599 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6648600 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6648601 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6648602 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6648603 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6648604 como si se tratara de la llegada al refugio m s extremo de la tierra
6648605 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6648606 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6648607 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6648608 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6648609 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6648610 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6648611 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6648612 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6648613 a veces me pregunto si nuestros pol ticos son unos irresponsables sin medida o si realmente crean
6648614 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6648615 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6648616 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6648617 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6648618 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6648619 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6648620 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6648621 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6648622 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6648623 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6648624 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6648625 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6648626 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6648627 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6648628 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6648629 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6648630 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6648631 and who are not about ego self aggrandizement getting their names in the press
6648632 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6648633 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6648634 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6648635 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6648636 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6648637 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6648638 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6648639 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6648640 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6648641 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6648642 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6648643 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6648644 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6648645 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6648646 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6648647 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6648648 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6648649 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6648650 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6648651 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6648652 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6648653 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6648654 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6648655 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6648656 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6648657 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6648658 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6648659 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6648660 three things in human life are important the first is to be kind the second is to be kind and the third is to be kind
6648661 the basic salary of a senator has increased from n993 697 to n2 484 242 50 while that of a member of the house of representatives has been jerked up from previous annual salary of n794 084 to n1 985 212 50
6648662 if we want to attract decent candidates for public office we need to move towards paying them a decent salary nothing outrageous just decent look at what is paid to parliamentarians in the europe and america
6648663 i would have no qualms if those law makers are the true representatives of the people
6648664 economic problems that will make this years financial turbulence look like a trip to the debt counselors office
6648665 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6648666 the fundamental basis of this nations laws was given to moses on the mount the fundamental basis of our bill of rights comes from the teachings we get from exodus and st matthew from isaiah and st paul
6648667 i dont think we emphasize that enough these days if we dont have a proper fundamental moral background we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state
6648668 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
6648669 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6648670 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6648671 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6648672 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6648673 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon

6648676 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6648677 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6648678 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6648679 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6648680 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6648681 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6648682 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6648683 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension

6648685 the neuroscientists idea of a game is rock paper scissors which is zero sum whereas economists have focused on strategic games that produce gains through collaboration
6648686 curiosity about neuroscience among economists has outstripped what we have to say for now
6648687 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6648688 they told me there are going to be resources here
6648689 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6648690 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6648691 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6648692 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6648693 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6648694 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6648695 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6648696 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6648697 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6648698 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6648699 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6648700 it didnt look good from a players or teammates standpoint
6648701 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6648702 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6648703 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6648704 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6648705 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6648706 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6648707 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6648708 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6648709 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6648710 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6648711 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6648712 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6648713 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6648714 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6648715 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6648716 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6648717 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6648718 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6648719 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6648720 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6648721 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6648722 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6648723 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6648724 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6648725 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6648726 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6648727 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6648728 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6648729 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6648730 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6648731 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6648732 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6648733 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6648734 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6648735 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6648736 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6648737 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6648738 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6648739 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6648740 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6648741 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6648742 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6648743 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6648744 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6648745 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6648746 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6648747 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6648748 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6648749 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6648750 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6648751 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6648752 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6648753 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6648754 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6648755 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6648756 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6648757 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6648758 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6648759 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6648760 yes and youre crazy tomorrow ill be sober but youll still be carzy
6648761 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6648762 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6648763 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6648764 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it

6648767 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6648768 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff
6648769 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6648770 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6648771 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6648772 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6648773 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6648774 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6648775 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6648776 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6648777 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6648778 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6648779 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6648780 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6648781 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6648782 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6648783 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6648784 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6648785 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6648786 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6648787 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6648788 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6648789 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6648790 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6648791 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6648792 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6648793 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6648794 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6648795 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6648796 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6648797 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6648798 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6648799 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6648800 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6648801 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6648802 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6648803 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6648804 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6648805 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6648806 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically
6648807 bowing to pressure from environmental groups the florida senate recently passed a bill backed by gov charlie crist that would eventually shut down six pipes that carry waste water into the atlantic from miami dade broward and palm beach counties
6648808 people are getting smart on the bs behind mmgw and that is exactly why algore is trying to recruit
6648809 no trippin we just have to stop dumping raw feces and piss into the ocean simple
6648810 i didnt know what to expect some kind of moonscape perhaps but it was incredible huge matrices of branching porites coral up to 8 meters 25 feet high had established creating a thriving coral reef habitat
6648811 throughout other parts of the lagoon it was awesome to see coral cover as high as 80 percent and large tree like branching coral formations with trunks 30 centimeters 12 inches thick
6648812 it seems like you won approval from all who write bs on every subject every day the know it alls stay true to yourself never change to please others or to fit in

6648816 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6648817 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6648818 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6648819 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6648820 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6648821 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6648822 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6648823 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6648824 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6648825 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6648826 at best inexcusably negligen n a film the main character can use an item or other of a definite brand as in the movie minority s according to age group sex geography and other general factors

6648837 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6648838 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6648839 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6648840 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6648841 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6648842 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6648843 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6648844 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet

6648847 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6648848 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells

6648870 the defendants return to methamphetamine production was attributed to his addiction to that drug

6648873 you are my god listen o lord to my supplication o lord god the strength of my salvation you have covered my head in the day of battle do not grant the desires of the wicked o lord nor let their evil plans prosper let not those who surround me lift up their heads let the evil of their lips overwhelm them let hot burning coals fall upon them let them be cast into the mire never to rise up again

6648876 have you considered my servant job there is no one like him on the earth a blameless and upright man who fears god and turns away from evil he still persists in his integrity although you incited me against him to destroy him for no reason
6648877 skin for skin all that people have they will give to save their lives but stretch out your hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse you to your face
6648878 very well he is in your power only spare his life
6648879 do you still persist in your integrity curse god and die

6648884 it could go back for miles and miles and theres no real mechanism to stop it
6648885 they should put their eyes out so they cant commit any more crimes
6648886 prison isnt a solution anymore they just form their own gangs inside prison and come out stronger
6648887 if they cant they should resign but they should not keep occupying government offices and getting paid to do nothing
6648888 a spiderweb of corruption has penetrated many parts of our department
6648889 now operate in drug trafficking kidnapping and money laundering among other things with no central control or any one gang dominating any of the criminal activities
6648890 that is why kidnapping has grown more competitive with kidnappers using much more violence against each other and against the victims in a bid to gain territory markets or dominance
6648891 it is clear that the public is indignant is angry and it has a right to be
6648892 it went very very smoothly and professionally the whale suffered as little as possible

6648896 its a long way offshore in a really remote isolated location a national parks and wildlife service spokeswoman said
6648897 we will attempt to see if we can collect dna samples however the weather is really bad down there
6648898 once the weather has cleared our staff will look at options for relocating it
6648899 we have some issues to work through in trying to retrieve it
6648900 its possible that its the mother but there are hundreds and hundreds of humpback whales across the coast at this time of the year and its not uncommon to have carcasses
6648901 then they dragged it to a closed tent and all the while they dragged it it was flapping its tail blowing out of its head and moving and trying to get away she said
6648902 it was so upsetting because euthanasia is meant to be an easy death and that whale did not have an easy death at all
6648903 it looked like a scene out of the antarctic with a japanese fishing boat it was absolutely disgusting mr littingham a sea captain told fairfax radio network
6648904 they have towed him behind the boat scenes reminiscent of what weve seen the japanese fishing trawlers do dragged him 400 metres across the bay
6648905 he was clearly still alive he was clearly moving the line was thrashing then theyve dragged him up onto the beach and put him into a tent and now we cant see whats happening and theres a possibility the whale was still alive when he arrived on the beach
6648906 were complaining about what the japanese are doing in the antarctic and were allowing it to happen in pittwater
6648907 we had five minutes and during that time they euthanased poor colin he said
6648908 that whale is now on the beach under cover and sadly hes passed away
6648909 they had a tractor here and theyre going to drag him up the beach and load him into a tip truck and take him to taronga zoo
6648910 all our experience that orrca has with cetaceans in this situation is that they very easily get stressed and a very quick dont think about it response is not the way to go she said
6648911 you need to gather your information talk to as many people as you can and thats exactly what national parks did
6648912 that was the best way it could have been done he told reporters
6648913 to an untrained person it might not look like the most fantastic thing but you cant get a better result than that he said
6648914 i was there it was done with as little stress as possible to the animal
6648915 the animal when they first got it and sedated it was very quiet very still we brought it onto the beach where it was euthanased by the vets other residents said the injured whale could not be helped jim macken said while many whales visited his local bay and left happily this one had unfortunately suffered a sad end they couldnt have done anything more for it mr macken said wildlife experts will conduct dna tests on a whale they believe may have been colin amp squo s mother hours after the lost whale calf was euthanased the development came as national parks and wildlife head sally barnes revealed colin was actually collette a female humpback whale calf it is believed a whale carcass being eaten by sharks near eden on the nsw south coast may have been her mother explaining why collette turned up alone and hungry in pittwater on sunday colleen or collette make up your minds posted by sally sobonnins of sydney 2 34pm today those who dwell on this event are obviously people with little to occupy their minds the whale is dead which in my opinion was the only humane thing to do if the death of this whale is the biggest problem these people have then life is better than a lot of people are telling us he she died painlessly quickly and peacefully hope im that lucky posted by john coffey of sydney 1 50pm today are we going to have a candle light vigil for this bloody whale tonght tow it out to sea and feed the sharks and let the circle of live go on posted by josephine of sydney 1 43pm today surely we as a society have bigger fish to fry posted by sean morrissey of sydney 1 43pm today posted by hiro of melbourne 1 39pm today to all the people heartless people who think the whole thing is outrageous a waste of time and for the person who said and i quote

6648920 they also have to be fairly good at improv theyll be asked questions by emergency responders and display the type of injury they have suffered
6648921 i think it would be a great opportunity to help out and it would be a good test of their clinical knowledge
6648922 the value is getting as close to real time training as possible
6648923 were really excited to stretch our legs on it and test it out
6648924 everyone is very connected to this animal and it is a very emotional decision
6648925 ive taken the decision that i dont want to prolong the agony of this animal
6648926 it was absolutely disgusting they have towed him behind the boat scenes reminiscent of what weve seen the japanese fishing trawlers do he was clearly still alive he was clearly moving the line was thrashing
6648927 i dont understand why they didnt let it die quietly it was obviously distressed im 41 years old and almost collapsed
6648928 it would face a higher predation pressure from sharks there is absolutely no information to suggest another humpback whale female would be available or wanting to adopt it
6648929 it does happen from time to time that calfs especially those born so far south of the birthing grounds will not make it
6648930 he heard me singing and came over i looked at him and he was full of life he had a few scratches and cuts on him and i was a bit worried about his eyes all he needed is a mothers milk
6648931 i dont recall much outrage from the bookselling community over that or any refusal to stock the printed book when it was finally ready
6648932 we did release the e book first to all e book providers
6648933 it was made available on april 3 2008 the printed book began shipping in may again to all booksellers at the same time

6648971 we have a good team we have good chemistry a lot of things are really working in our favor right now
6648972 it was a big win for us were really confident weve been able to find a way to win ballgames that is something we werent doing early in the year
6648973 double play wed get wright at second too he had taken off he was halfway home cant fault him i mean ball gets in the lights you cant see it
6648974 we just have to continue playing good baseball and let things happen the way they have been happening
6648975 i might have an opportunity to be out there one more time in september before this place goes but itll definitely hold a special place in my memories in my baseball career
6648976 lose a ball in the lights it costs you a ballgame a little flip to first base costs you a ballgame
6648977 it was a tremendous game to snap our losing streak and it went right down to the wire
6648978 we knew people were writing about it everywhere now we want to win a couple more
6648979 i just try to take care of things i can control
6648980 every guy in that room knows we can hit better
6648981 we have to start stringing together some wins we cant just keep winning one here losing one there weve got to get on a streak here hopefully that can start friday night
6648982 we have to do better if we want to play in october
6648983 we made things happen we had that winning attitude right now it feels like we have to be a little perfect we have to do everything right to catch a break and get a win
6648984 hes not the best pitcher in the game for nothing
6648985 hes not going to leave the ball in the middle of the plate hes not going to throw too many straight pitches hes so good hed be the ace on any team in the big leagues
6648986 my sinker wasnt there my slider wasnt there my change up wasnt there i pitched like crap and i let these guys down today
6648987 sidney couldnt find his rhythm and we had to go to the bullpen early they just kept tacking on
6648988 the second you second guess yourself is when things start to cause problems we have our ups and downs when it comes to being aggressive but its part of the learning process
6648989 its one of those things where if it works you get praised for it and if it doesnt you look like the dumb rookie
6648990 it wasnt really a risky play when it comes to ending the inning i figured the closer i could get to home plate the better off the team would be
6648991 more than anything were throwing the ball better were pitching better here at home and thats a big part of it
6648992 we just couldnt break it open and when that happens you put pressure on your defense put pressure on your pitching and bad things can happen
6648993 they got some guys on the bases and made stuff happen we tried to do the same thing but couldnt get that hit
6648994 weve got to get ourselves back on the winning track right now and do whatever it takes to win ballgames we cant worry about what theyre doing or how it puts us in the standings weve got to win
6648995 we continue to believe this is a very important initiative and we remain committed to achieving an outcome that is both a net benefit for the nonproliferation regime and that meets indias energy needs
6648996 the nsg should reject this ill considered unwise and unproductive plan

6649054 this government is determined to support veterans and ex serving personnel who may suffer psychologically as a result of their service
6649055 however to do so we need a better understanding of the incidence and characteristics of suicide amongst this community
6649056 we know that war service can have both physical and mental impact on the lives of service personnel
6649057 physical impairment can be obvious psychological injury is less so
6649058 we continue to preach the benefits of the user experience and thanks to iphones ease of navigation exciting color saturated graphics and companions user consistent adobe flash guis we can deliver on the oft ignored premise that the user experience is paramount and not the plethora of gadgets

6649063 when we announced our decision to leave our current television series after seven years we were very touched by the number of people friends family guests viewers and broadcasters who told us how much they wanted to see us continuing making programmes together
6649064 i told you rex but you didnt believe me did you its just people that arent in the group who want people in their final five thats all it is its pretty obvious
6649065 theres no chance of layoffs especially with the way the world is going right now its steady work
6649066 theyre not even realizing the outcomes might be better at the hospital they pay 40 percent less for
6649067 we put a lot of stake in the numbers we spend a lot of time working to improve our system
6649068 for hospitals that take this seriously our numbers are even better than they were a year ago
6649069 i dont think you can just look at the mortality but i think its part and parcel of improving patient care and safety
6649070 most hospitals are much better than they were before this initiative started
6649071 if the iraqi government at that time decides it is necessary to keep the american forces longer they can do so
6649072 what my presence can do is to identify any final obstacles
6649073 this is a local decision about whether to grant a grocery beer and wine license as part of an economic development initiative

6649075 she and her colleagues have done their part on the senate side and shes certainly looking forward for action to be taken by the house on what should be a simple home rule petition
6649076 its sen walshs position that its rep mcmurtrys responsibility to represent the interests of his district by pushing for a massive economic engine for the region hes showing that hes committed to doing that
6649077 no one knows their districts better than those who represent them
6649078 feels that the westwood bill is going to affect his community
6649079 in this case he is standing up for his community thats the check and balance with the home rule process

6649090 i thought things would go the justice way but justice is fickle i guess
6649091 i honestly dont know why it went the way it did this is the first time ive heard all this stuff that the d a is putting out that is not my child
6649092 obviously he does not want to come out and be arrested

6649099 he was a nice kid a friendly guy he didnt get into trouble he was at home most of the time he always helped people out if he could
6649100 maybe he was too nice he kept himself to himself he didnt get involved in trouble
6649101 no i think last year it was definitely a big relief that was the first time i had faced a situation like that possibly picking up and moving and wearing a different uniform second time around maybe it was a little easier to take
6649102 the part that was hard actually was losing those other two guys
6649103 honestly i dont know whats going to happen with me this offseason i really dont so yeah you go out on the field with that feeling that hey this might be my last month and a half in a pittsburgh uniform and i want to end it as well as i can
6649104 those people have been through a lot and i feel like ive been through it with them
6649105 jack wilson is such a huge part of the pirates
6649106 i dont know the direction of shortstop for this team i can see theyve made their direction as far as the team goes building with young guys so i hope to find that out as soon as i can
6649107 jacks been in a pirates uniform a long time and between him and freddy those probably are our most recognizable players
6649108 the reality is that we cant make emotional decisions on any player jack certainly has proven his worth again defensively and we can see that the whole club solidified with him out there but we always need to leave ourselves the ability to make the team better jack hopefully will be a big part of this turnaround going forward but as it was with jason and xavier and damaso marte if the right baseball trade is out there well have to entertain it
6649109 well i laid down odds on that last year and i was wrong
6649110 but no matter what ill keep going out there every day with the same attitude ive always had

6649337 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us

6649339 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6649340 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him

6649387 ebs starts out really simple you create a volume from 1gb to 1tb in size and then you mount it on a device like dev sdj on an instance format it and off you go later you can detach it let it sit for a while and then reattach it to a different instance you can also snapshot the volume at any time to s3 and if you want to restore your snapshot you can create a fresh volume from the snapshot sounds simple eh it is but the devil is in the detail
6649388 ebs volumes have redundancy built in which means that they will not fail if an individual drive fails or some other single failure occurs but they are not as redundant as s3 storage which replicates data into multiple availability zones an ebs volume lives entirely in one availability zone this means that making snapshot backups which are stored in s3 is important for long term data safeguarding
6649389 ebs volumes are network attached disk storage and thus take a slice off the instances overall network bandwidth
6649390 any number larger than that is an error in your math
6649391 with that being said this years festival is still dry in all honesty i think its one thing that distinguishes rukus from the rest of the big music events in the area i would rather have people visit one of the fine local establishments if theyre so inclined that way they get to check out some of the local bars that are within walking distance of the venue and we dont have to charge them a ridiculously overpriced amount for a beer
6649392 after such a long day full of so much work it was a little on the grueling side to still have to play a set
6649393 so this year were playing at 6 p m and are letting some friends and amazing musicians finish out the show
6649394 this years festival will benefit the hattie larlham creative arts program which provides people with severe disabilities the opportunity to create paintings write and record music take photographs and mold pottery through an advanced system of questioning and the corresponding responses
6649395 this system allows the individual to create these pieces of art exactly the way that they want them even though the persons physical ability may be severely limited through facilitation by an experienced art tracker it is such an amazingly unique experience for the people involved
6649396 their true desires are actually being heard and carried out for the first time in most of their lives and the product is some truly beautiful artwork and music
6649397 i just want to let you know that im ok
6649398 they were stores of some type we just dont know what they were selling who was running them
6649399 we know that it was pretty secretive whatever it was that was down here because not too many people know anything about it
6649400 you know you just think of the underground as such a dark spooky place but to think that this could have maybe been some kind of vibrant economic center is just kind of baffling really
6649401 i think it would just be kind of tragic if no one knew what it was or if no one cared

6649407 we are grateful to the washington post the new york times time magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost 40 years it would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the bright lights of publicity during those years but the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march toward a world government the supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in past centuries

6649422 when we were sitting down before last years game to talk about the selection as a committee this is one of the charities that came up it was an easy call to have them be the charity this year
6649423 when we were approached by the committee from the oldtime game we jumped at it
6649424 its a real neighborhood event which is one of the things that makes it so special

6649432 its entrusted with a great deal of highly confidential material and it seems to be entirely incapable of keeping it secure
6649433 and the consequences are very serious theyre serious because it may lead to the identity of the people involved being revealed
6649434 one of the possible consequences is that they criminals will bring legal actions against the government and the taxpayer will then have to pay damages to people who appear to be pretty undeserving because of the governments incompetence

6649437 we should see marriage as a better stage of dating because now you have the chance to live together when you live with the man or woman you love you should see his her imperfections as funny or good thing because we are not perfect
6649438 old days you always knew when you were boyfriend and girlfriend because the proposal but now a days is so hard to know because you start dating dating is about kisses hugs going to have a drink together getting to know each other sexuality most of the time

6649441 i think whats really special about this building is now students faculty and visitors will want to come to the cub
6649442 i think the reopening celebration of the cub will give an opportunity to re energize the center of campus
6649443 the cub will become a destination point to the wsu community

6649448 jon lafler looks really good justin englund looks great all these kids they wouldnt be here if they werent really talented so i can see any one of them stepping up and helping us
6649449 but im really optimistic because all the returners had great track seasons and im kind of excited because when older people leave theres always younger people that step up i think we have a good shot at making nationals its kind of our goal
6649450 more information has been brought to light and brought to our attention so we decided to go to the federation and have them look into it further

6649466 the odors are so strong that the detectives that are working inside those rooms they have to wear special suits and masks
6649467 if you just look at the plants themselves youre looking at easily several hundred thousand dollars
6649468 this is unfortunately something that we do see more and more of with it being harder to get the drugs that people need to make the methamphetamine thats why weve seen an increase in the amount of marijuana grows that weve investigated

6649492 the survival horizon identifies the point in time after which a threatened population is expected to experience a catastrophic collapse
6649493 it is the point from which a species is unlikely to recover by identifying a survival horizon of 2042 geas has given human civilization a definite deadline for making substantive changes to planet and practices
6649494 each super threat on its own poses a serious challenge to the worlds adaptive capacity
6649495 acting together the five super threats may irreversibly overwhelm our species ability to survive
6649496 previous geas simulations with significantly less data and cross validation correctly forecasted the most surprising species collapses of the past decade sciurus carolinenis and sciurus vulgaris for example and anatidae chen so we have very good reason to believe that these simulation results while shocking do accurately represent the rapidly growing threats to the viability of the human species
6649497 we are grateful for geas work and we treat their latest forecast with seriousness and profound gravity

6649503 whatever the price we have to fix the relationship between georgia and russia
6649504 georgia was a russian colony for more than 200 years but this is the 21st century the time for colonies is over georgia now has the strong support of the outside world
6649505 you know what mistake the russian leadership is making when they say they dont want to deal with saakashvili that he should resign and only when there is a new president they will start a new conversation with georgia previously when the military campaign in tskhinvali failed and georgians subjected saakashvili to serious criticism most of the people were against the president but when russia began to ask for his resignation most of the people began to support him it is the georgian nature you have to understand
6649506 you must be the boy he left behind when he took ship for troy all because of me and my mad passion for trojan paris aphrodites curse was already wearing off when last i saw your father what a man ill never forget his daring and his guile
6649507 he had beaten himself black and blue and dressed up in a beggars rags to sneak into troy but i recognized him when he spoke to me there in the house of paris i bathed him and gave him a fresh robe and he made his escape killing many a trojan on his way i rejoiced for i missed my home and the blameless husband i had forsaken

6649509 odysseus was in command it was everything he could do to keep us quiet when you started calling out to us imitating the voice of each mans wife
6649510 my father is the old man of the sea she said you and three picked men of your crew must catch him and pin him down she helped us with disguises the hides of seals which stank to high heaven she even rubbed
6649511 and when the ancient came for his midday nap amongst the seals as was his custom we jumped him and held on for dear life
6649512 he said that zeus himself was furious because we had failed to sacrifice before setting sail wed have to slog back up the nile and start all over and as he was an all knowing god i asked which of our comrades had perished on the

6649532 i was intrigued by erikson right away because just by the fact that if he was in the u s it would have been pretty straightforward he wouldnt have gone this long without being able to hear
6649533 this is a family that probably lives on 200 a month
6649534 they live on a very small garden patch where they basically grow their own food
6649535 if we can get him to the point where he can distinguish sounds and hear music hell proceed on the track hes been on since birth which is to make the best of what he has
6649536 the ultimate issue is how can this child provide for himself in the future
6649537 can he work can he marry can he provide for his family
6649538 in light of the conclusions in the report and the history of advocacy in this province its not clear that that should be one of the priorities
6649539 crime victims are often the forgotten individuals of the criminal justice system and are sometimes treated with less attention respect and sensitivity than they deserve
6649540 the rights of the victims of crime have never been a priority for premier dalton mcguintys government
6649541 the only time when they took any action to do anything for them was when they were dragged kicking and screaming into doing it by the ombudsmans report
6649542 the office of a victim advocate as an officer of the legislative assembly would address all of the concerns that victims have had and permit the legislature to receive non partisan guidance on a regular basis of where the gaps are in the system
6649543 we are as mr mcmurtry says a leader and a model for other jurisdictions
6649544 i am honored to receive this award on behalf of the many individuals who have contributed to the success of qatars nationwide gis
6649545 the implementation of an enterprise wide gis in qatar has resulted in cost savings because of greater efficiency better decision making improved communication better geographic information record keeping and the opportunity to manage its data geographically
6649546 the compatibility itself tends to encourage and sustain cooperation because the data is readily transferred and easy to use
6649547 im guessing theyre seeing advance ticket purchases that arent what they have seen in the past
6649548 we have a number of banks that are still under investigation and we obviously are having conversations about resolution
6649549 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6649550 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6649551 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6649552 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6649553 china seed is dedicated to delivering the highest yielding seed to chinese farmers and we believe a broader joint venture with monsanto will enable our business to expand our offerings to chinese farmers
6649554 we are excited about the potential that our combined efforts can have in improving farm productivity increasing farmer incomes and helping chinese farmers to meet both chinas and the worlds growing demand for grain
6649555 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet
6649556 the power pack for your laptop isnt that efficient its one of those things thats almost too good to be true
6649557 we developed a lot of cars very quickly in a short time frame
6649558 thats the way we used to do it back in the day
6649559 wed rather make it right than rush it to market
6649560 they havent been very successful and theyre still paying for it with the sebring and avenger
6649561 as those gas prices move higher the product that chrysler has in the midsize and small segments really isnt that good relative to its competition
6649562 the content level has been totally revised were taking care of those cars right now as best we can
6649563 we felt we wanted to provide that information and opportunity to donors to help us and help themselves too
6649564 i know from talking to colleagues that other institutions have done it are doing it or will do it
6649565 people give money to us not because of the tax benefits but because of their interest in the institution
6649566 we try to provide them with the very best advice as to how they can maximize the deductions
6649567 if anyone would like to help us out we have a number of projects that are worthy
6649568 the thing that makes this special right now specifically in st louis is that everybody is going to be forced to sell their a b stock
6649569 there are probably more people around st louis who own the stock than if you went to some other city
6649570 i think everyone is beginning to realize that this is a cash event and there will be capital gains tax if you dont do something ahead of time
6649571 if you are inclined to be philanthropic then identifying a charity or the community foundation to give the stock to is a way to minimize that
6649572 understand the changing nature of philanthropy in america the move from large corporate givers to individual philanthropy
6649573 one pressure is the cost the environmental movement is not just cool its being legislated now
6649574 i think the lighting designers have been energy conscious for a while
6649575 architects are trained in shaping space but not in much detail in actual lighting of space
6649576 so lighting designers understand a number of different ways that means can be achieved they also understand certain fixtures have a lower cost than others or that some may have a higher initial cost but lower long term costs
6649577 my philosophy is we enjoy getting involved on projects that have the ability to change peoples lives and perceptions
6649578 the project was both a technical and artistic challenge of the highest order the lighting was to reveal the arch in the most flattering way possible emphasizing its key views from surrounding blocks and incoming highways nearly three years of technical and aesthetic mock ups and computer modeling were required to obtain the approved design
6649579 the lighting design was vital to the projects nighttime identity
6649580 the lighting design strives to reveal the memorials artistic architectural and landscape character after dark while serving as a reinforcement to the visitors experience the lighting design will provide dramatic visual reinforcement of dr kings words inscribed in the memorials feature wall as well as an artistic revelation of his likeness carved into a large stone of hope the project has had to steer through years of design approvals involving various capital authorities and district of columbia committees
6649581 the lighting design will reveal the twin tower architecture as sculptural forms the buildings are symbolic for the urban renaissance ongoing in the new city section of hangzhou it is the nighttime centerpiece of the region
6649582 fuel capacity and offload and our 767 200 doesnt fill that bill
6649583 to come up with a proposal that meets this requirement
6649584 we are asking for six months to put together a meaningful proposal
6649585 we havent hit a million yet but were working on it
6649586 its not a sit in the closet gather dust product
6649587 we found people with wheelchairs dont want to put ugly stuff on their wheelchairs
6649588 its not something youre going to stock on your shelf
6649589 so many people have been pushing wheelchairs for so long their shoulders get torn up
6649590 this bill will put pressure on mr rudd to fully fund to support the local communities the local the local farms tourists operators the environment local programs that are being run to support the environment in what is an unfolding environmental economic tragedy he said
6649591 its extremely important that we get mr rudds attention while mr rudd is focused on what is happening overseas its important that he knows how bad this situation here is
6649592 jamie briggs is going the length and breadth of this community talking to small business people farmers local communities everyone who is concerned about the environment he is working tirelessly to see what the community wants to see the money spend on
6649593 everything from water carting to the preservation of turtles to the compensation of businesses to the lifting of boats that are stuck in mud to dealing in a financial way with the anguish that is felt by this community
6649594 that is not heard by mr rudd who seems indifferent to all of it the 50 million must be invested on those things the community itself see as important
6649595 either kevin rudd and penny wong support the bill or they demonstrate that they dont care about the people of the lower lakes
6649596 i think it would be really useful for our businesses which have been forgotten in this whole equation
6649597 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet

6649607 sedona ariz sen john mccain said in an interview that he did not know how many houses he and his wife own a comment that democrats immediately seized on as evidence that the republican nominee is out of touch with the economic plight of most americans click here for audio of the interview its condominiums where ill have them get to you the democratic national committee quickly send out a list noting that mccain owns at least seven different residences that catalogue includes two homes in phoenix one of which is a 4 66 million condominium and a 1 94 million vacation complex in sedona where he is spending this weekend before the democratic convention

6649609 the first movie was an across america race death race 3000 will be an around the world race and its set further in the future so the cars are even more futuristic so youve got cars with rockets machine guns force fields cars that can split apart and re form a bit like transformers cars that become invisible
6649610 shows widely loathed director writer anderson to be an even worse filmmaker than his r sum suggests takes the bare bones concept of cars and drivers engaged in state sanctioned slaughter and reduces it to dull gladiatorial combat safely taking place behind the privatized penitentiary walls of terminal island anderson has neutered the original films outrageously transgressive macadam mayhem and completely stripped the story of its pointedly political social satire making this death race one of the most boring drags of all time
6649611 with its inexplicably watchable shotgun riding bimbos unconscious homoeroticism and
6649612 filled with weaponized vehicles pyrotechnics exploding skulls and some mesmerizingly enormous female breasts but no sex or love stuff
6649613 the agents that are tested under the biowatch program were selected for a number of reasons that include the access or availability ease of handling the pathogens the ability to test for them and the consequences an attack using one of the six agents would have on the country
6649614 if you can intervene with treatment before people get sick you can actually prevent the illnesses from occurring
6649615 the idea is that we gain that extra time and treat people so they wouldnt get ill
6649616 thirty six hours is too long and if were going to have an air detection system like this we need to reduce the time
6649617 if we are going to spend money to try to detect these poisons we need to do it in a way that saves people and not just spends money
6649618 it was never intended to be that real time is there one spore of some little agent thats floating in the air oops we need to get everyone away from there
6649619 its really just to provide us with lead time that might be beneficial in preventing illness
6649620 i think the best we can say about biowatch is that its an unproven system
6649621 until theres an event that biowatch detects or could detect its unproven
6649622 if these new generations of systems are better and quicker and cheaper than they may make a better program for us
6649623 this one has been pretty expensive but i think it may lead to some things that may work and are much more cost affective
6649624 our goal is certainly to expand the number of jurisdictions that operate the biowatch program obviously dependent upon the amount of funding that is provided and we are also in the planning stage to deploy the capability at high risk indoor facilities
6649625 here take some of my poo best of luck with your new challenges

6649634 they brought their a game i dont know where we left ours its packed somewhere in my suitcase
6649635 we were ready for this test and it was a test
6649636 they played a great game even when we werent making our shots they seemed to be making everything we never got rattled our defense really led us through this
6649637 they were determined not to let me score hammon said
6649638 theyve got a great team ill be rooting for them to win gold
6649639 vindicated i feel great i feel amazing i just won a gold medal
6649640 hope is a great player especially on the crossed ball
6649641 we win this game if she is not on the field
6649642 it was the wrong decision and i think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves
6649643 just go out and hit that first shot in the fairway and go from there
6649644 even though it wasnt the ending i wanted i wouldnt trade the last four years for anything
6649645 i studied every little detail for this race said the 22 year old merritt from chicago
6649646 i wasnt going to let anything get in my way or get me off track i stuck to what i said i was going to do
6649647 i was in good position and all when i tried to make my move like i usually do coming off the turn it just wasnt there for some reason i dont know what it was i ran the best i could i didnt have anything left at the end
6649648 its time to put aside the failed policies of the past and start moving in a new direction by encouraging companies like iberdrola to locate here and making the necessary investments that will grow this industry
6649649 instead some psc members have taken a decidedly hostile view toward this project which i find baffling we are poised to become a world class leader in the field of wind generation both in terms of actual energy production and the businesses that serve them iberdrola has made significant upgrades to this deal its time for the psc to get on board
6649650 this is the one preseason game that will resemble the regular season nose tackle tank johnson said
6649651 more specific about what we want to do this game than long term
6649652 we need more playing time to come together as a team
6649653 once the games start everybody gets that lather going and youre ready to go out there and play
6649654 i just like to compete man and whatever happens happens
6649655 im learning the defense and im playing without thinking right now so thats the best thing
6649656 if you play in this country and you grow up in this country and you put on a russian uniform you are not being patriotic
6649657 i didnt even acknowledge her in the postgame handshake because today she is russian
6649658 this is the only uniform i could ever put on
6649659 she chose to be an american wearing a russian uniform
6649660 during the national anthem i was saying a prayer of thanksgiving that im an american
6649661 i know that in my heart i love my country
6649662 when drug companies increase the cost of life saving drugs 10 fold overnight congress is obligated to step up some members are already doing that and i applaud their efforts but more must be done to ensure no one goes untreated while drug companies try to explain away these ridiculous increases as necessary if i am elected to congress i will demand explanations from the drug companies and fight for regular people who cannot afford such outrageous prices
6649663 the soaring cost of energy and gasoline are driving up the prices regular consumers have to pay at the pump and now for everything else too while oil companies reap record profits folks are facing increasing rates of inflation and stagnant wages its time washington stop doing favors for big oil and find ways to ease the burden people across the country are feeling so acutely
6649664 republicans national challenge to defend their house of representatives seats is no more pronounced than in monroe county where democrats could take two open seats in the 25th district which is based in syracuse and stretches into webster irondequoit and penfield democrat dan maffei pronounced ma fay 40 has been running for the seat for about four years his opponent dale sweetland enjoys name recognition as the former onondaga county legislature chairman and a 2007 candidate for countywide office but he got started late and has raised about a tenth of the campaign funds raised by maffei
6649665 now is not the time to remove incentives for producing alternative energy
6649666 it is important that congress make passage of these tax credits a top priority when it reconvenes new windfarms including businesses that serve this industry have the potential to be a significant economic engine to this area companies that are making new investments in alternative energy need to know the government is serious about supporting them and the ptc cannot be allowed to expire
6649667 in towns such as dewitt where maffei makes his home voters would consistently back democrats for president senate and sometimes governor but they would still elect moderate republicans who closely monitored constituents moods to local offices in odd year elections
6649668 suddenly this once republican town is voting democratic in off years
6649669 though the area is shifting to the democrats its still a very moderate area
6649670 suddenly this once republican town is voting democratic in off years
6649671 i think the same thing you saw in the south with democrats in the 70s and 80s youre seeing in the northeast now with republicans
6649672 what youve seen is that republicans were successful in the northeast when they were a more moderate to liberal party
6649673 in 2006 that race was not necessarily a race about jim walsh
6649674 it was about an unpopular president and an unpopular war
6649675 people dont bring iraq up to me nearly as much as they did with jim walsh two years ago these folks in this district many of them are still upset with president bush but president bush isnt going to be there on the ballot
6649676 energy costs are brutal its very hard to be competitive
6649677 i think it qualifies me more than a lot of people to have spent 14 years learning about those programs and watching what effect all those programs have on people
6649678 i sit i think like many people do and watch people point fingers try to lay blame at everyone elses feet
6649679 i think its my heritage in growing up on a farm and farming all my life and knowing that if you dont do something its not likely someone will come along and do your job for you
6649680 its one of the ways you can really change things
6649681 nobody is perfect i do believe charlie rangel is a great american
6649682 in no other seat did republican chances collapse as much and as quickly as in this staten island seat
6649683 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man
6649684 he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known
6649685 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known
6649686 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6649687 exxon mobil is padding the pockets of speculators where they should focus on u s production
6649688 instead of idly watching the american economy suffocate under the weight of gas prices exxon needs to spend significantly more on research and development in the vast areas where they are already permitted to drill and have failed to take any action

6649692 it is to the public detriment to fuel an industry where women are degraded and treated as sex objects
6649693 if private companies want to engage in such activity its not criminal in this nation and theyre free to do so but for the government to use to public resource to promote such degradation shows how detached the bureaucracy is from the canadian people
6649694 nuance was pretty damn smart to find us when they did they looked at this market very early on and identified snapin as having a key position
6649695 they had a single minded focus on what this means to them and how to integrate snapin with their technology
6649696 i think snapin was worth more to a big company than it could grow to be on its own
6649697 as we checked out the deal the price was something we found acceptable
6649698 its a natural extension of the mobile market 1 2 billion phones are sold each year and theyre all getting smarter and smarter im just glad we started working on this when we did five or six years ago nuance said why not take advantage of this huge capability to solve a lot of problems

6649708 you know ive been asking when we were going to get things going our way
6649709 things never seemed to go our way but now i think this is the right time were catching breaks but were fighting for those breaks too
6649710 weve been able to find a way to win ballgames and we werent doing that early in the year the good teams do that
6649711 even if we get behind we know we can win
6649712 this is what we wanted to see i have kept asking when is it we are going to get things to go our way because it never did now i think it is the right time if it is to happen this is the right time for it to happen

6649720 i noticed what appeared to be a gunshot wound to the back of the head i went down reached to try to see if he had a pulse i didnt feel any pulse
6649721 i think it would be pretty cool to be the last guy to hit a home run in this ballpark
6649722 i think that the odds of that are pretty slim to none
6649723 but even to hit a home run here in my last at bat here would be awfully special
6649724 i am hoping to get a seat with a number 10 on it
6649725 id also like to get something blue and orange and something that says shea stadium on it
6649726 i have a corner in my basement my sanctuary for all my shea memorabilia

6649731 create as large a repository as possible of real time metrics data from windows pcs all over the world whos running what and how its performing
6649732 these users are not necessarily representative of windows vista users as a whole
6649733 per our longstanding practice allowing downgrade rights enterprise customers and purchasers of windows vista ultimate or windows vista business editions can choose to downgrade to windows xp professional if they feel they need more time to get ready for windows vista
6649734 we found that 65 percent of the boxes pre loaded with vista were still running it and the rest were running windows xp
6649735 either manually wiped the drive and installed xp or paid the vendor to uninstall vista and install xp it blows you away that people will pay not to have the default operating system
6649736 getting metrics about your pc is not the kind of thing grandma would want to do

6649760 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6649761 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6649762 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6649763 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6649764 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here

6649785 static typing is the future all modern languages use it languages that use dynamic typing are relics of the past soon to be extinct or only used for toy scripts but no educated serious mature programmer could possibly make the tradeoff that the benefits of dynamic typing are worth the cost of losing the static type checker only ignorant uneducated naive programmers believe such primitive nonsense

6649790 its unusual to be asked what we are going to do ahead of a rate cut but on what we know today this is a pretty simple equation anz chief executive mike smith said
6649791 if funding costs continue at the current levels and the reserve bank do actually cut rates then there will be a full flow on to our mortgage customers
6649792 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down he said
6649793 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision

6649822 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6649823 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6649824 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6649825 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6649858 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6649859 its like the smithsonian you could be here for weeks and not see everything
6649860 any time an attraction opens attendance inevitably is going to slide from your opening year

6649863 we believe it tells the story in a more accurate and compelling way by conserving them
6649864 id always said id never write a book like this
6649865 turns the traditional memoir on its head assuming as it does that its author knows nothing about his own life and must research it as though it were someone elses
6649866 an exercise in self indulgent narcissism what a waste of talent energy and professional competence
6649867 his idea is that i should write a big long book about my glorious media career
6649868 and he and about four other people would read that
6649869 she had pushed me back out of her life once and she didnt really feel a need to have me back in i think she thought the book idea was stupid
6649870 i like her and she likes me but its just weird really weird
6649871 how about that scab you have on you from you know 20 years ago
6649872 he did some outrageous things and he did some horrible things and yet thats not who he is but thats what drugs will do to you
6649873 but it was not a one tissue affair i continued the interview with a huge wad up one nostril my head filling with blood as i struggled to finish
6649874 if someone had lit a truth candle and the governor had asked me why my nose was bleeding i would have said it was because i had been sticking things up it all night long
6649875 i hated being a bad father i couldnt stand that and theres nothing in my upbringing to allow for that
6649876 ive told people i expected him to be dead in the 1988 89 era
6649877 wasnt born like a bratty kid or a wiseguy or a troublemaker
6649878 i just had a specific instance with a specific sort of allergy to mood altering chemicals that by the way you know probably 20 30 40 million americans have so its not that uncommon i just sort of took it to uncommon ends
6649879 ive always thought it the times was a magnificent thing to read and look at i just never pictured the likes of me working here

6649887 ive never been uncomfortable with that aspect i dont feel like its beneath me to sell what i did
6649888 heartbreaking for the australian we were in there for a meeeedddaaaaal
6649889 it feels great to actually put some runs across the board for halladay
6649890 all he needs is one run pretty much after that he does what he does
6649891 and it was early we added on its fun pitching in games like that especially against good teams
6649892 hes not one of them he never was one of them
6649893 in my view hes never been accepted by the horsey set
6649894 he was absolutely suicidal we were so scared we were losing him

6649914 they cant find out the stuff they want to find out and theyve got so much to do because there have been so many cuts
6649915 you no longer have that favoured guy who gets the wink and the nod before everyone else mr wilson said
6649916 unless youve got an analyst with a really good handle on an industry it just gets tougher and tougher in an environment like this
6649917 often an individual analyst knows the company better than we do because they follow it on a daily basis mr dodson said
6649918 good analysts will bring a company to our attention thats not getting a lot of attention on wall street
6649919 its not the high profit high dollar profession that it used to be said mr hellwig
6649920 in the wake of all the regulation to separate investment banking from analysis the job of the analyst became just that often just watching the stocks and checking the estimates
6649921 nobody knows right now how bad it could be as the us economy slows and banks credit losses continue to climb a corker too dear to drink
6649922 its unusual to be asked what we are going to do ahead of a rate cut but on what we know today this is a pretty simple equation anz boss mike smith said today
6649923 if funding costs continue at the current levels and the reserve bank do actually cut rates then there will be a full flow on to our mortgage customers
6649924 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down he said
6649925 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision

6649931 hate to be the guy who gets to find the camera
6649932 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6649933 so far everything that has been received demonstrates we have no problem for the eligibility of the competitors
6649934 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6649935 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6649936 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6649937 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6649938 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6649939 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6649940 ive had a blast i wasnt afraid or anything im so glad i was able to embark on this journey
6649941 just another way to help them out and just another way for me to follow my passions
6649942 i wouldnt really consider myself to be particularly athletic right now

6649945 ioi is our top pick in the malaysian plantation space
6649946 we are delighted that indians are making their mark in various disciplines in the ongoing olympics
6649947 sportsmen like sushil kumar and abhinav bindra olympics gold medal winner for air rifle shooting have paved the path for more success to follow
6649948 he is very talented thats why he is here he has performed well in the domestic circuit and has been a part of every india a tour this was his first game and he was under pressure especially playing against murali and mendis but i thought he negotiated them really well
6649949 he took up the challenge and responsibility to score those runs that was a good effort by the youngster and its good to have him in the side
6649950 he badrinath certainly had the pressure of scoring those runs that will give him more confidence and more experience you dont have to play 100 games to get experience the more you are in these situations the more comfortable you are in dealing with them in future a lapse of concentration against good bowlers will get you out
6649951 the credit should go to the fast bowlers especially bowling in tough hot and humid conditions zaheer particular bowled well he has been consistent for the last four years i have seen him bowl like this for sometime now he is always there he has moved way ahead even when it comes to his fielding even in england he bowled really well
6649952 whenever you give him the ball he will give more than 100 percent its really good to have a bowler like him
6649953 but when i got elected to the executive board of the players association i told gene i need you to be the player rep
6649954 because i saw those qualities that other people hadnt seen i knew right away that gene had the leadership and qualities to be a leader on and off the football field thats why we picked him as one of the captains of the team
6649955 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6649956 when i think about gene upshaw i think about no 63 pulling
6649957 a lot of people called it highway 63 thats what i remember and i know about gene because when he pulled around that left side he got in like a hurricane coming through wiped out everything that was there
6649958 gene was tough he just felt he couldnt get beat he had the determination to be the very best and when we drafted him mr davis knew that he would be the very best
6649959 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6649960 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6649961 a guy like delamielleure says the things he said about me you think im going to invite him to dinner no im going to break his damn neck
6649962 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6649963 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6649964 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6649965 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game in the big picture
6649966 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man gene upshaws career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy we loved him and he loved us we will miss him our hearts go out to terri and the boys
6649967 i sure hope that we throw aside our differences i hope we can get together and work for the goodness of northampton county as far as the sheriffs department is concerned the sheriffs department is very important to northampton county i hope that we pass this tonight go forward so that the administration sheriffs department and sheriffs deputies are now working as one

6649972 mans structure internal and external compared with that of the other animals shows that fruit and succulent vegetables are his natural food
6649973 this is sad for u s softball because our expectations were so high
6649974 but at the same time im an olympic silver medalist and not many people can say that
6649975 i saw the runner going home out of the corner of my eye and i guess i rushed a little bit didnt make as good a throw as i could have
6649976 you train your whole life for this you want to win as for the big picture i havent really thought about it thats something ill do in the future for right now it is what it seems to be
6649977 when the truck gets about seven years old it should probably be sold
6649978 in case the truck meets with an accident and is damaged badly it should be sold else later might cause minor problems which would need to be serviced again and again
6649979 if it starts causing more technical problems rather than being used for the business selling the truck should be considered
6649980 the truck should be sold away if it is giving some minor problems but is fetching you a good resale value
6649981 the social stigma of the child being born outside marriage
6649982 officials will work very closely with federal and state agencies to investigate these claims
6649983 i dont need one and my coach has a mobile and i am always with him or in the village
6649984 i slept very well better than all these months and for the whole of last year when i was keyed up for olympics there was no tension of training or matches today i got up as usual and prayed first to bajrang bali as is my habit then some fruits and milk as breakfast and meeting my colleagues
6649985 a television channel reporter contacted my parents and i got to speak to them
6649986 i spoke to my father and he said umeed to gold ki thi magar agli baar gold zaroor lana and he was very happy
6649987 for the last 10 12 years he has been getting milk in the morning for me regardless of whether it is raining or hot or whatever the weather
6649988 sirji woh dekhenge jab milega ill think about them when i get it
6649989 yes people have been telling me that it is good but we should take care of our training competition diet and so on more importantly when we are coming up
6649990 everybody all my coaches padmashree satpal my parents media and all others
6649991 yes we could have had a masseur or physio to help us recover kartar singhji gave me the massage in between repechage bouts maybe we will have that from now
6649992 they were all good yogeshwar dutt lost to the wrestler who won a bronze and in boxing vijender akhil and jitender have been very good and above all it feels good to have won more than one medal that makes us proud in future there will be more from wrestling and other sports
6649993 they want us to win a medal for india like sushil i called up home last night and my parents said that we too want you to achieve success in wrestling we all look up to sushil bhaiya and his win has given us reason to work hard and achieve what he has done for the country
6649994 we started competing and then we came here to participate in one championship we decided to take admission here because this is the best place to learn wrestling in the country it was very difficult for our parents at first
6649995 but now they have taken it in their stride our parents are happy with our wrestling we go home once in a while my younger brother has gone home to help my father in making ganesha idols it is time for us to earn some money and one of us has to be at home to help my father
6649996 my brother is the youngest here and he too has won the school championships
6649997 our parents send us around rs 2500 every month and we somehow manage with it we contribute around rs 1000 for the food the rest of the facilities are free we got rs 1000 as scholarship after winning the school games and that helped us a lot we send some money to home also
6649998 most of them are from the villages in the northern part of the country they learn wrestling in akharas wreslting dens and then come here they all are very enthusiastic about the sport
6649999 sushils win will surely raise the profile of the sport we need to have an indoor hall here for practice and now we are hopeful that it will come up
