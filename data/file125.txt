1250000 were also pleased to see the support for livestock grazing since cattle and sheep ranching are so important to rural utahs economy
1250001 along with supporting agriculture utahns should also support open spaces and other ways to preserve farmland

1250012 in fact darcy frey says mvrdvs architects rely so much on gathering and metabolizing data information and competing points of view that they insist they leave no formal signature on their work
1250013 some of the mvrdv designs are so logical they seem to turn reality on its head
1250014 but this case might be caused by social conflict or some individuals who have some extreme ideas
1250015 im making all of the changes that you think i need to make and it will never happen again

1250020 i always thought a good conservative would have a photo of queen elizabeth on his laptop
1250021 it is like when taking a bath in the bathroom it doesnt mean there is pollution whether the sky is blue has something to do with air quality but it is not equated with air quality we need to focus on statistics gathered through a monitoring process
1250022 i believe the air quality will be greatly improved during the games
1250023 there were days where you didnt see the sun at all
1250024 it looked like when we had the really bad fires in orange county you could kind of see this ball in the sky but you couldnt quite make it out people i never heard weeze before you could hear them audibly weezing
1250025 beijing promised something it could not be sure of delivering
1250026 blue sky days are not necessarily days when the sky looks blue

1250029 look i know my husband did not sleep in his truck not alone anyway i would appreciate if you we could just stop discussing this because you sound as idiotic as he does
1250030 well what do you expect me to say its not like i can say something different
1250031 you can if you want to tell the truth or you can perpetuate a lie it doesnt matter either way because its not your fault just dont sit there looking at me like you expect me to believe you
1250032 i can honestly say that i had drinks with him i left him in a parking lot and when i came back from my date the truck was still there
1250033 i had a date meet me at a hotel and that is where your husband dropped me off
1250034 so you are telling me that he dropped you at a hotel and you went in and came out hours later and the truck was still there
1250035 i dont know if he was in the truck or not i just thought it was odd that the truck was still there
1250036 so you are telling me you saw his truck parked in a parking lot in the middle of the night and didnt check to see if he was still in it dead or alive
1250037 if you had thought something could possibly be wrong you would have checked correct
1250038 so you knew he was fine just not at home like he should be
1250039 i know you didnt and i would never say that you said that i just appreciate that you are treating me like i have a brain
1250040 what are you going to tell him that i said
1250041 nothing as fas as im concerned you just confirmed what i already knew but i wont say a word to him about it

1250045 if you are prone on your belly and you jump you will instead drop down to the next floor there are some floors that dont let you do this also do not drop if there is anything deadly directly above you dropping makes you briefly stand up and you will die
1250046 your laser l produces a column of what appears to be flame this weapon is the worst for enemy bases where the soldiers are really tiny

1250059 we started torturing him around 11 oclock at night and by two oclock in the morning we had set him on fire in the parking lot

1250061 i said well let me look for it i think i left it in the trailer this went on for about a week and then i had to just kinda come clean
1250062 we had to earn it we had to come back and win it they have a pretty good bullpen torii got us a big hit to start it and g a anderson moved him over
1250063 especially as the beijing olympic games draw near a range of anti china forces and hostile forces are striving by any means and redoubling efforts to engage in trouble making and sabotage
1250064 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
1250065 a safe olympics is also the biggest indicator of the positive reflection of our nations image
1250066 i enjoy cooking and playing with ideas for new recipes
1250067 about 100 million first time voters will enter the election landscape next year that is a staggering number of young people and the indian youth is impatient for change
1250068 we want to project the image of advani around the idea of change the same way that obamas message resonated with peoples hunger for change
1250069 like the obama brand we need to create a buzz around advani ji
1250070 in order to address climate change all major economies must be at the table
1250071 and thats what took place today the g 8 expressed our desire to have a significant reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050 we made it clear and the other nations agreed that they must also participate in an ambitious goal with interim goals and interim plans to enable the world to successfully address climate change
1250072 by protecting our environment and resisting protectionism and fighting disease and promoting development and improving the daily life for millions around the world we serve both our interests as americans and we serve the interest of the world

1250075 it is unacceptable that almost seven years after nearly 3 000 americans were killed on our soil the terrorists who attacked us on 9 11 are still at large
1250076 the central front in the war on terror is not iraq and it never was
1250077 one front right now is going better than the other and thats iraq where were succeeding and our troops are coming home based upon success
1250078 afghanistan is a tough fight and its really important we succeed there as well as in iraq
1250079 from the way they talk americans believe even if the world disappears america wouldnt disappear
1250080 i personally believe we are not going to make it in time

1250088 we are focused on digital pathology thats the only thing we do and its the only thing weve ever done from our perspective digital pathology is managing the information thats generated by being able to digitize entire slides
1250089 the digitization of microscope slides bringing in high resolution image management searching mining of imaging data and image analysis finally the power of the internet can be used to manage information whether its a clinical report educational content peer reviews formal or informal or second opinions all these pieces put together are something we as a company have focused on
1250090 we believe it will be a little less than two years before we have a product i think that well be able to describe it in high level detail by the end of this year but its the sort of product that needs fda approval and that adds a certain amount of time to it
1250091 the main ones are speed of acquisition of an image quality of the image ability to navigate around the image without having to wait for the image to come up and then the ability to stream images the cost of storage has dropped by 30 to 40 percent a year
1250092 the assumption is the market will adopt digital pathology at the same rate that digital radiology was adopted so in several years we believe and at the price points were assuming the market will support that the market will be worth about 2 billion
1250093 weve looked at the market and weve made a hypothetical full adoption in the market and say its close to 4 billion a year thats about twice the size of what ge had in their analysis we see more value in digital diagnosis that could be applied to automate things that pathologists are currently spending time on

1250106 in these times of world economic recession one would have expected revenue collections to be worse but the figures show otherwise
1250107 the agencies have become proactive and vigilant in their areas of work
1250108 the spate of smuggling has reduced and car custom documentation is also going up
1250109 unfortunately we have accepted western culture hook line and sinker relegating our tradition to the background
1250110 the civil servant is a ghanaian first and foremost hence should not be discriminated against in all spheres of endeavour including participating in active politics once these are in the best interest of ghanaians
1250111 since they have each scored 2 2 and so we need people to vote for the npp to ensure that the penalties go in our favour
1250112 political parties must stop the blame game and stick to the rules of the elections
1250113 there would be no cause for violence if all parties adhered to these laid down procedures
1250114 it is temporary shortage and once the ecs attention is drawn to it it will be corrected immediately
1250115 we have enough forms ink laminators among others for registration and there should not be any cause for alarm
1250116 i wonder how many road and building contractors were given awards during the recent wholesale national awards but i assure you that atta mills will put a separate award scheme in place for you when i become president
1250117 ndc will ensure strict implementation of the financial administration law in that respect to allow for prompt payment for contracts
1250118 we will ensure that it will be agreed that all foreign contractors partner with local contractors on 60 40 per cent basis for contract execution
1250119 my government will also ensure that foreign contractors join the local associations just like every professional body everywhere in the world
1250120 you cant operate as a lawyer in any country without recourse to the bar association of the country this should apply to engineers and contractors as well
1250121 we will establish a clearly laid out classification system with the help of local industry players to ensure that contractors awarded government contracts had the capacity and expertise to deliver

1250126 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1250127 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1250128 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1250129 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk

1250132 seeing a picture before even taking a photograph is something different
1250133 non jews living under jewish law in eretz yisrael land of israel must either be enslaved as water carriers and wood hewers or banished or exterminated
1250134 the difference between a jewish soul and souls of non jews all of them in all different levels is greater and deeper than the difference between a human soul and the soul of cattle
1250135 so much so that the world was created solely for the sake of jews
1250136 the majesty of israel and the question of the diaspora
1250137 there is no such thing as enemy civilians in war time
1250138 the law of our torah is to have mercy on our soldiers and to save them this is the real moral behind israels torah and we must not feel guilty due to foreign morals
1250139 a thousand non jewish lives are not worth a jews fingernail
1250140 is considered among the most learned sages of the torah
1250141 it is impossible to mix the pure with the impure they the arabs are a blight a devil a disaster the arabs are donkeys and we have to ask ourselves why god didnt create them to walk on all four well the answer is that they are needed to build and clean they dont have any place in our school
1250142 if they dont stop after we kill 100 then we must kill a thousand and if they dont stop after 1 000 then we must kill 10 000 if they still dont stop we must kill 100 000 even a million whatever it takes to make them stop
1250143 what is hateful to yourself dont do to your fellow human being that is the whole of the torah and the rest is commentary
1250144 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1250145 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1250146 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved
1250147 i advised him to eliminate the angry tone in his writing
1250148 this is open and naked aggression and this is not the first time that the u s led forces have done this

1250150 we have time to farm but no tractors no buffaloes and no seed
1250151 agreed to provide a complete and correct declaration of all its nuclear programs including clarification regarding the uranium issue by the end of the year
1250152 the declaration does reference the discussions that the united states had with north korea on uranium enrichment and proliferation but it is not appropriate for me to discuss the details at this time
1250153 what we really have is sort of a potemkin village of u s policy in which theres a great deal of difference between these initial bold pledges and then subsequent reality often behind the scenes
1250154 we have to keep working on issues that have still not been fully disclosed although not denied by the north koreans
1250155 it was less than a year ago that they were still producing plutonium and plutonium is what they tested as a nuclear weapon
1250156 and plutonium is really first of all what we needed to stop their production of and secondly what we need to eventually have them abandon
1250157 dissatisfied with the medico legal expertise on the death of a local girl student
1250158 the action is not very fast not very effective and not very well oriented
1250159 it wont work unless the government hits the right targets unless the government strikes at the true leadership of these extremists
1250160 is it simply a side issue or part of a larger strategy for establishing the writ of the state wherever it is challenged
1250161 indeed the operation could be deemed a success if the main road to afghanistan is secured still there is no knowing whether such security gains if they are indeed achieved can be sustained
1250162 the united states has no illusions about the regime in pyongyang
1250163 we remain deeply concerned about north koreas human rights abuses nuclear testing and proliferation ballistic missile programs and the threat it continues to pose

1250165 my rickshaw is my life its very cheap for my passengers
1250166 we must save the cycle rickshaw drivers look at the soaring fuel price hikes
1250167 these bikes are wonderful alternatives they provide an affordable smog free choice
1250168 but unfortunately when the whole world is talking about the environment we in south asia are talking about development we somehow think we are better if we have hordes of swanky cars
1250169 we should be building bike lanes to provide the cycle rickshaws a humane driving area for many reasons lets face it fuel prices are only getting higher and here we have an alternative right in front of us
1250170 if we keep banning them we will regret this in future generations

1250178 and i thank you for coming to help make that relationship even stronger
1250179 i told the prime minister that i thought the strides the government is making towards religious freedom is noteworthy
1250180 its being dealt with in a way similar to china which is as part of a dialogue and not front and center
1250181 its a very careful step by step move forward in the relationship but each step is substantial
1250182 rapid development in the vietnam u s relationship toward a friendly and constructive partnership
1250183 we have listened to your complaints and removed all pop ups and consoles
1250184 in many many ways the damage has already been done
1250185 it certainly would have been a lot easier if the u s government had taken this seriously back in 2004 back then these guys were looked upon as miscreants and cretins like they were just internet terrorists and not for real
1250186 it is just plain embarrassing that al qaeda is better at communicating its message on the internet than america
1250187 as one foreign diplomat asked a couple of years ago how has one man in a cave managed to outcommunicate the worlds greatest communication society
1250188 when i saw what they were being fed i was shaking i was so angry

1250191 theres a tear in your retinal tissues and fluid has seeped in causing a distortion in your vision there arent any obvious reasons for this no one knows for certain i guess from whats going on in your life and so can you that there are a lot of dramatic events in it more men tend to get this than women its been correlated with stress and perhaps from elevated cortisone levels also related to stress you know when you feel out of control especially since serious central serous retinopathy tends to affect type a personalities
1250192 when you have two of your key players looking the president the coach and their own teammates in the eye and actually lying to them it really destroys the essence of the club
1250193 it was decided by the leadership group that these two players actually dont deserve to wear the collingwood football club jumper and thats why theyre not playing for the rest of the season

1250234 for decades the medial temporal lobe structures have been linked to both memory and spatial cognition
1250235 so we set out to test how these two abilities related to one another and to the temporal lobe area of the brain
1250236 we concluded that the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are not essential for path integration since we showed that the tests could be successfully accomplished despite damage to these brain regions
1250237 he just kept complaining to oprah that hes this successful film director and yet the paparazzi ignore him
1250238 so while on vacation in italy oprah took him by the arm and said come on lets go take some pictures
1250239 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1250240 if videotapes were made they were likely used for translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1250241 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1250242 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1250243 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1250244 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1250245 there are two routes leading to the temple and the barricades put up to streamline human traffic broke down and in the melee everything went haywire
1250246 it was raining very heavily and the crowds had swelled immensely and as soon as the rain stopped people tried to rush ahead
1250247 there was a man with his child and he was shaking the child to see if he was alive and all the time tears were flowing down his cheeks
1250248 no one from the police or administration was helping and it was just people helping each other in the pouring rain
1250249 there was total chaos everywhere and i saw dead bodies everywhere and blood soaked survivors crying for help
1250250 i am so shocked that i am trembling in my house and terrified to step out and go to work
1250251 i do not think any single organization or any single meeting is going to solve all these problems
1250252 but i think every organization and every meeting should try to make a direct contribution and that is what the saarc leaders have pledged themselves to do together and that is what we as observers are trying to work with them to do
1250253 this summit has rekindled the hope and belief among our peoples regarding the delivery and prosperity that we collectively promised 23 years ago
1250254 look at the information mr hamdan provided to the united states when it mattered most
1250255 you know what mr hamdan had agreed to do and you know how we squandered that opportunity
1250256 the leader of al qaeda himself hosted a wedding feast for the accused this shows just how close he was to the very top of this terrorist conspiracy
1250257 not one witness said he had any role in the terrorist attacks themselves
1250258 the treatment was fair they told us that we are political prisoners accordingly their treatment was not bad but good
1250259 fears of insolvency have not as yet been fully set aside
1250260 there may be numbers of banks and other financial institutions that at the edge of defaulting will end up being bailed out by governments
1250261 lower global stock prices could impede the recapitalization of banks and other financial institutions debt issuance would also be suppressed as it leverages off the level of equity
1250262 the price of equities worldwide will determine whether the international financial system can maintain a modicum of stability as it eases out of its credit crunch or falls back into another period of angst and turmoil
1250263 the cause of our economic despair however is human natures propensity to sway from fear to euphoria and back a condition that no economic paradigm has proved capable of suppressing without severe hardship
1250264 regulation the alleged effective solution to todays crisis has never been able to eliminate historys crises
1250265 we may not easily confront or accept the price dynamics of home and equity prices but we can fend off cries of political despair which counsel the containment of competitive markets
1250266 it is essential that we do so the remarkably strong performance of the world economy since the near universal adoption of market capitalism is testament to the benefits of increasing economic flexibility
1250267 we have seen the nigger we have seen the greaseball we have seen the chink the slit eyed jap but we never saw the kike because they knew perfectly well thats where you draw the wagons around
1250268 christ calls us to turn the other cheek not bomb bomb bomb iran jesus insists we love our neighbor not put up a fence up to keep them out the lord i believe in healed the sick if i read the scriptures correctly christ did not deny the leper health care because he had a preexisting condition
1250269 he has showed you o man what is good and what does the lord require of you to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your god
1250270 i was hungry and you gave me something to eat
1250271 each side is asking for guarantees still things are not solved
1250272 you are not white either symbolically or literally as anyone knows who goes to israel
1250273 even the blondest jew has negro marker genes which are due to concubinage prostitution and slavery
1250274 the court has decided that as nevzlin poses a special threat to society he should serve life in a high security prison
1250275 the decision of the court was written in advance by the kremlin and there is no surprise in this decision
1250276 this is a show trial managed under the supervision of the kremlin and controlled by putin and his gang i intend to appeal to the european court of human rights against this show trial that was held in russia
1250277 courts all over the world have ruled that russia is a place of political persecution courts in england in switzerland in the netherlands in israel so the only place such a show trial can be held is in russia
1250278 our investigation discovered harassment that engaged in the worst stereotypes and slurs about blacks latinos and jews and that upper management actively participated in this behavior
1250279 the settlement should send a strong message that harassment based on race national origin and religion has no place in the workplace
1250280 they died not because they thought life was good or death was good but because they knew how to accomplish each one best

1250283 he really took it to heart knowing what is going to be more important football or school
1250284 hes doing great his weight is down to 240 it is the first time i have ever weighed more than him 260
1250285 he is thick and strong he is focusing on school and working out
1250286 youve gotten so dark and so have your men all the goddamn this and fuck that its like i dont even recognize you
1250287 every day on 7 on 7 and in the weight room i worked to improve my flexibility to make sure my route running was better
1250288 he showed up and really looked good at the first practice i thought he was pretty precise
1250289 when you are thrown into the fire like he was last year you are just playing on your pure instincts
1250290 if he can clean some of his routes up and understand how to get open more he can be a 50 70 catches type of a guy you can get the ball to
1250291 i will try to break 100 catches no fifty or seventy is good
1250292 i feel a lot faster after going through the weight program
1250293 i can jump higher move faster and go side to side i feel better than the first year
1250294 we need to keep finding ways to get him the football
1250295 food is such a basic need that you can see people really going to great lengths
1250296 this leads to various distress responses one of which on the part of women is having transactional sex to feed their kids
1250297 recent studies in botswana swaziland malawi zambia and tanzania have shown associations between acute food insecurity and unprotected transactional sex among poor women

1250302 disney has taken the themes and the spirit of the characters from the original series and adapted them beautifully
1250303 to me disney has surpassed expectations in bringing our loving hero to the big screen theres no better way to ensure that the movie would be open to all audiences especially families than having disney adapt it
1250304 underdog was a character and a series that was designed for kids of all ages and the lead character is a kid himself just a very powerful one
1250305 the screening i attended was filled with children who seemed to love the movie which means quite a lot to me because this franchise has been so close to my heart over the years
1250306 i dont think a true live action underdog movie would have been possible until today
1250307 modern visual effects and new technologies are able to bring the characters to life in a way that would not have been possible when we created the series
1250308 when the combined product categories contain the string laser the cost
1250309 we havent decided how many players will be picked in the team if there are sixteen players in the team the selectors are likely to pick two wicket keepers if they pick only 15 dhoni will be the only wicket keeper and that will make eight batsmen including the indian captain and seven bowlers

1250349 adrian had allegedly been spending time recently with model melissa keller
1250350 its simply designed to cater to the needs of women travelers who are growing faster in numbers than male travelers one of the things weve changed is to keep our fitness facilities open 24 7 so much of what we do by the way is applicable to both men and women
1250351 all we want is to go the extra mile to make women feel welcome
1250352 women dont aspire to be isolated after working years to be assimilated
1250353 women couldnt stay in a hotel unless their fathers or husbands checked them in
1250354 by the mid 80s separate floors in hotels offended many women who were traveling on business
1250355 they were trying to be c e o s but were looked on as the weaker sex womens floors became a kind of sexist thing instead of a polite offer
1250356 management couldnt sell any empty womens rooms to male travelers even when they were full up elsewhere in the hotel
1250357 and if a hotel made say the second floor for women only there were complaints about not having a better view on a higher floor
1250358 but the 10 percent who panned the idea led us to back off
1250359 the cardinals told marcel they were releasing him now so he would have a better chance of catching on with another team

1250365 my role my story this person it has been very largely positive i think my parents are very proud of that
1250366 i said its my calling and im really meant for this job
1250367 not only that im a coach of an olympic level athlete i have intimate knowledge of the games im you can say somewhat of a technical expert in this sport thats the professional side of it
1250368 on the other side i am fluent in chinese and i have a lot of connections in china china in particular and probably asia in general its so much who you know youve got to be able to speak to the right person and get to the right person and theyve got to trust you at least in terms of track and field i dont think anyone in this country has more and better connections
1250369 the guy slept above me in a bunk bed for four years
1250370 my friends are now the ones pretty much in charge of all aspects of sports in china every time i turn around i know somebody in bocog beijing organizing committee for olympic games from the director of competitions to officials on the floor of the track officiating
1250371 were no longer in the middle of the city li said
1250372 they moved us to the outskirts its a lot more secure location
1250373 the chinese really feel a threat about someone trying to sabotage the games and what better target than a big american delegation
1250374 it defeats the purpose of the olympic games he said
1250375 thats war thats when they settle those disputes i guess but weve found a stage to say were going to put all those other things aside and focus on our basic humanity thats a wonderful thing

1250397 looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
1250398 with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1250399 thats an indication not only that there arent going to be any more increases in interest rates but raises the question of when do they cut
1250400 the statement does not give any clues as to when that might be
1250401 additional rises in market interest rates and tougher credit standards have delivered some additional tightening of financial conditions without them having to lift a finger

1250911 all of a sudden some more negative reviews got posted but there were no favorable or positive reviews
1250912 i feel like they are extorting money and preying basically on business owners
1250913 the agency refused to release the findings until they were published in a peer reviewed medical journal
1250914 this paper has been scrutinized by some of the best statisticians in the country and is much better now than when we started this process

1250917 leave it to us guys to destroy whats good and honorable
1250918 my head is still spinning i cant quite believe what has happened and how quickly it has happened
1250919 i just liked the whole afl package the speed of the game the varied skills and the competitiveness
1250920 id always played soccer and i guess my long term goal was to play for australia
1250921 i was thinking that if things went well maybe at 20 or 21 i might move to brisbane to see how far i could go
1250922 i wasnt really too interested in afl back then although i used to watch the brisbane lions on tv although that all changed when i started playing
1250923 when you have two of your key players looking the president the coach and their own teammates in the eye and actually lying to them it really destroys the essence of the club
1250924 it was decided by the leadership group that these two players actually dont deserve to wear the collingwood football club jumper and thats why theyre not playing for the rest of the season
1250925 do we have a cultural issue on that absolutely not
1250926 we have a playing group that lives every day disciplined and focussed on winning a premiership
1250927 i cant see why they are backing me i think people should start saving their money or put it on someone else theres six or seven other blokes who are well ahead
1250928 its pretty similar his form compared to last year but i have to play a number of different roles than i did last year
1250929 different positions which i have absolutely enjoyed and it has developed me as a footballer
1250930 good for business good for the environment and good for our neighborhoods
1250931 i didnt really know clarko that well and i had played on him several times and to stop me running he used to punch on with me
1250932 clarko moved on a lot of my close mates who were a bit older i thought thats not a great way to start a relationship
1250933 i honestly dont think anyone could have done a better job than what hes done i have no doubt thats a main reason why were having success
1250934 hes an extraordinary athlete and my only way of trying to defeat him was to try to belt him but i couldnt catch him all that often
1250935 there were so many within the playing group that looked up to him and he needed to assure the rest of his team mates that the direction of the decision making that the team had undertaken was the right one for the club
1250936 all those people who arent lucky enough to be around the club now to see the way it is i just wish that they could see how great the club is inside and out
1250937 researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
1250938 the researchers traced ascorbates anti cancer effect to the formation of hydrogen peroxide in the extracellular fluid surrounding the tumors normal cells were unaffected
1250939 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example two oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1250940 injected ascorbate into the veins or abdominal cavities of rodents with aggressive brain ovarian and pancreatic tumors
1250941 up to four grams per kilogram of body weight daily
1250942 the researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
1250943 in immune deficient mice with rapidly spreading ovarian pancreatic and glioblastoma brain tumors the ascorbate injections reduced tumor growth and weight by 41 to 53 percent
1250944 provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1250945 mr rudd and mr swan between them over eight months have destroyed business and consumer confidence in the australian economy
1250946 they talked up inflation as being a crisis they delivered higher taxes in the budget and now weve seen petrol and grocery prices increase
1250947 that was always mr rudds plan to slow the economy
1250948 we know exactly where we are at at the moment and we have to change a few things
1250949 i think on the weekend we showed patches of good form
1250950 but to be a good side in this competition being so even you have to be able to consistently produce it week in week out quarter by quarter which the top sides like geelong have been able to do and we are not producing that at the moment
1250951 it was the second quarter when our concentration lapsed letting a flood of goals in cost us the game
1250952 the western bulldogs are still sitting in the top four and they are a good side
1250953 so to be able to do that for three quarters is good but not good enough in the afl competition weve got to consistently be able to do it
1250954 you get knocked around a bit with your confidence when you lose games of footy but we are just looking forward to the challenge getting a win on the board hopefully on the weekend and then move forward
1250955 we are not a side that is probably playing like they should be fourth at the moment but we are really looking forward to the challenge this week
1250956 it was great to be able to bring some kids in you get that enthusiasm and confidence
1250957 adam goodes will be close and leo barry will be up and around the mark we just have to pick the best possible team we can
1250958 but they definitely gave us a lift on the weekend the young players
1250959 my wifes due to have a baby in early october so its going to be a bit of a tough time for her and for us having a new baby
1250960 we also have an 18 month old boy so well wait and see what happens but its going to be pretty unlikely
1250961 i havent spoken to anyone at the australian rugby league
1250962 i just found out i was in the squad the other day and ill have to take the appropriate sort of action and speak to the right people
1250963 id love to play and i think if my wife wasnt pregnant id love to jump at the opportunity but its one of those things you want to be there for your family as well it can be a pretty tough time and an exciting time also so its something i dont want to miss out on
1250964 the way he carried the ball and smashed blokes he was awesome
1250965 i said to the boys after the game i thought simmos performance if you contrast other players where theyve come back after injury it was a credit to simmo just how dominant he was
1250966 it is a complicated issue it is something that is up to deidre and it is up to the liberal party to resolve and it is not something i should be involved in
1250967 i cant answer whether she will be given another seat
1250968 wise heads have to prevail it is an extraordinary situation that we find ourselves in
1250969 the important thing is we are going about winning government and all liberal members of parliament must be united in that
1250970 when the liberals meet tomorrow i hope there is open and frank discussion of forming an opposition
1250971 i have been an mp for 18 years i have received remarkable goodwill and friendship from my electorate
1250972 it is my electorate more than anyone that has been urging me take on this role
1250973 if i am elected leader of the liberal party tomorrow i will endeavour to answer all of your questions
1250974 its a tribute to wade and our medical staff that hes in a position to come back into the side now
1250975 hes done everything required of him and were pleased hes made it back for what is another really important game for us against one of the competitions best sides
1250976 its a huge game for us it always is when you play them and im really looking forward to being out there with the boys again
1250977 i really appreciate the work the medical guys have done and i cant wait to get back into it
1250978 its been difficult at times working my way back from the operation but everyone has been helping me
1250979 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
1250980 if the people we love are stolen from us the way to have them live on is to never stop loving them
1250981 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
1250982 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
1250983 it was quite sickening to watch my wife almost threw up and had to lie down afterward
1250984 it was very strange it was like two police officers having a sword fight
1250985 they were very fierce it was a very fierce attack

1250987 take your art your powers of dissuasion your ability to disrupt incite excite inspire and intrigue to make comment to make beautiful to make real to make people think again
1250988 of course of course ill keep going imagine if i gave up now
1250989 were a little apprehensive since the last one was a hoax
1250990 and we learned that you have to keep the ball in your breadbasket which we realized means under the boobs if youre a girl

1251008 pathological narcissism is a spectrum of disorders people suffering from the full blown all pervasive personality distorting mental health disorder known as the narcissistic personality disorder npd are indeed more prone to violence than others actually the differential diagnosis the difference between npd and aspd antisocial pd psychopaths is very blurred most psychopaths have narcissistic traits and many a narcissist are also sadists both types are devoid of empathy are remorseless ruthless and relentless in their pursuit of their goals the narcissists goal is narcissistic supply or the avoidance of narcissistic injury narcissists often use verbal and psychological abuse and violence against those closest to them some of them move from abstract aggression the emotion leading to violence and permeating it to the physically concrete sphere of violence many narcissists are also paranoid and vindictive

1251011 men in the past in macon have not thought about women to serve in commissioner positions because theyre not used to it
1251012 not considered to be in the mix when candidates are being proposed
1251013 extremely competent women dont even think of themselves as candidates
1251014 it had been a traditional male position and i think the mindset was to have another man in that position if it wasnt said it was implied
1251015 you could feel the walls that were built against a female running in that position
1251016 its an attitude and those attitudes have to be changed in order for barriers to be broken down
1251017 since the bibb county commission has been all male for so long then i think people have come to look at it as an all male elected body
1251018 in order to change that this community has got to embrace and support women who would like to run for the county commission
1251019 i suspect most of us down there would be fine to have a woman on the board as long as theyre not taking our place

1251027 it seems that while the quantity group was busily churning out piles of work and learning from their mistakes the quality group had sat theorizing about perfection and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay
1251028 trying to perfect an implementation in ones mind is a form of speculation t he elegant implementation you see when you read a great programmers code is often the third or fourth try the great programmer is often more effective because they can implement several solutions in the same amount of time it takes the average programmer to implement one

1251368 when im im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1251369 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1251370 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1251371 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1251372 i asked barack obama what he wanted for his birthday
1251373 as a white sox fan this hurts a little bit
1251374 i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as both the first lady and
1251375 we dont oppose the olympics but its wrong for them to demolish our house its wrong
1251376 we believe with the support of the government with the help of the international community we have the confidence and the ability to host a safe and secure olympic games
1251377 saddened at the loss of life and injuries caused by the attack and extend our condolences to the victims and their families
1251378 refrain from using this incident to crack down further upon peaceful uighurs
1251379 we condemn all acts of violence the uyghur people do not support acts that engender bloodshed
1251380 especially in the vast countryside heavily populated by uighurs the chinese government has rolled out a political movement without end or reason that is unbearable to the uighur peasantry the entire uighur people live in a blanket state of fear
1251381 you could be trained to give a girl what could possibly be the most technically flawless fucking of her life but if you dont know what to whisper in my ear when youre behind or how to look at me when youre inside then it doesnt really matter
1251382 hell get really old one day and youll say remember dane reynolds he can barely walk cause he did too many huge airs and got hurt a lot so now he walks with a pimp limp
1251383 if we dont foster talent were condemning the state to a bleak future
1251384 ultimately it is about a fair outcome as opposed to a ludicrous bid
1251385 what their bid is about is 2 8 billion more over three years the whole education budget is 2 billion so it is totally unaffordable it is sort of magic pudding meets wizard of oz
1251386 i am happy to have people protest outside my electoral office but it is not going to change the situation at all
1251387 looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
1251388 with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1251389 thats an indication not only that there arent going to be any more increases in interest rates but raises the question of when do they cut
1251390 the statement does not give any clues as to when that might be
1251391 additional rises in market interest rates and tougher credit standards have delivered some additional tightening of financial conditions without them having to lift a finger
1251392 there could be one by christmas theyre going to wait for more data
1251393 theyve got an easing bias but theres no timing on that theyre not in a particular rush to change
1251394 they talk about uncertainty weighing on both inflation and growth
1251395 they did talk about inflation remaining high in the short term but on balance economic growth remains subdued
1251396 looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
1251397 if every garage mechanic and driver knew the details and was involved in the planning of the attack it never would have happened
1251398 you must decide the weight and significance if any such statements deserve
1251399 it is attention that has significance for the war on terror
1251400 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1251401 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1251402 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1251403 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1251404 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1251405 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over
1251406 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1251407 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1251408 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1251409 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1251410 that there were no intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1251411 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1251412 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1251413 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1251414 the allegation that the directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1251415 makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1251416 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1251417 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no
1251418 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1251419 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1251420 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1251421 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1251422 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1251423 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1251424 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1251425 tendency of the to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1251426 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1251427 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1251428 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1251429 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1251430 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1251431 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
1251432 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
1251433 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1251434 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1251435 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1251436 has merit in terms of just a short term effect on prices
1251437 i offer no suggestion it will make a long term impact on the fact that demand worldwide is going up while supply is flatlined
1251438 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1251439 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1251440 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1251441 hes rehydrating hes eating a little and getting some oxygen
1251442 anyway i can walk and i want to descend to the base camp
1251443 the armys pilots are still waiting for an improvement in the weather conditions and the moment they were allowed to fly they will pick up the italian mountaineer
1251444 everything was going well to camp four and on summit attempt everything went wrong
1251445 are holding up well and are very proud of gers achievement and are still in total shock in relation to the fact that he may not be coming back
1251446 at high altitude at over 8 000 meters 26 250 feet it is too dangerous to mount a rescue to have the bodies returned
1251447 interrogation over the theft of a bracelet and a missing phone on march 6 last year
1251448 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
1251449 my opponent wants to set a date to come home i want us to come home with victory and honor so we will never go back again
1251450 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1251451 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1251452 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1251453 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1251454 i asked barack obama what he wanted for his birthday
1251455 as a white sox fan this hurts a little bit
1251456 i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as both the first lady and miss buffalo chip
1251457 whats an apertura did i have any on my last trip to panchos mexican buffet
1251458 is the difference between divisi n a like the difference between the masculine and the feminine
1251459 this is just a fun way for me to say hey boys im still here
1251460 the people who bought the homes say well we love looking into your yard and seeing the horses and the cattle but we dont like the flies and we dont like the mosquitoes and when i cut my field to bale it they say we dont like the dust in the air
1251461 i respect that theyre here and spent a lot on their homes but on the other hand give me a little bit too ive been here since i was 7 years old
1251462 ive talked to my neighbors and worked things out i really just thought this would be a funny thing to do
1251463 these can come out just as easy as they went in
1251464 that person that youre calling on the reservation line may be in their house slippers
1251465 i thought it was something that would be nearly impossible to do from home
1251466 there are people working full time the pay scale rate identical to what you would make corporately according to your skill sets
1251467 you of course want to schedule yourself during the times when there are infomercials running or around meal times because thats when a lot of the restaurants will be calling
1251468 when im waiting at the airport my flights been delayed i can pull out my laptop put my headphones on and work
1251469 i really like the flexibility because im able to spend the time with my kids i can do things with them throughout the day they both play sports so im able to work around their schedules
1251470 itll be easier for me to make decisions on other cars if im stepping away from mine
1251471 thanks to wines such as these i shant be needing the ch teauneuf du pape on my next visit to the enchanted valley
1251472 this will have the attention of the world on this city for four days and it will show how politically our party has a great story to tell in this region
1251473 it surprises people to know that there is a democratic governor in wyoming and a democratic governor in montana and that is a story we want to tell they arent your typical party partisans the leaders out here the democratic leaders are known for bipartisan solutions common sense solutions to common problems
1251474 to be fair i think colorado is a purple state there is no denying that some of that i think has been peculiar and unique to colorado
1251475 is not emblematic of a purple tide washing over the west
1251476 we are sitting here waiting for the influx of trial lawyers and union members the really stereotypical democratic coalitions that are not in keeping with how the west perceives itself to be
1251477 it becomes a sort of old time democratic coalition politics versus a very sort of new and different image that they are trying to portray
1251478 if i were running the gop id be going to colorado
1251479 i think the environment favors the democrats this year and you can see it in the electoral geography democrats are seeing new opportunities they havent seen before and republicans are in the unenviable position of defending what they used to take for granted
1251480 even as we keep working globally we need to do much more to fight aids at home and i intend to do so with my foundation
1251481 in some communities out there its the volunteer fire department or nothing
1251482 so if they cant keep the volunteer fire department viable then the potential exists that theyre not going to have any protection at all
1251483 i hate to admit it but theres been more times this year where other departments have had to help us out
1251484 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along
1251485 its pretty clear there was a lapse in terms of the quality control of yahoos keyword list
1251486 leverages a combination of algorithmic and editorial processes to identify current relevant and popular terms
1251487 we are really only in the infancy of this kind of automated analysis
1251488 im sure its going to be expanding greatly not just in volume but in sophistication
1251489 the quality of the content and the information is paramount
1251490 you want to make sure youre striking the right balance between giving your readers everything the web has to offer with making sure theyre getting the right information and the relevant information
1251491 is much better than any plane ive flown its more responsive more powerful and more stable
1251492 its got nothing to do with me at all i am not involved at all with altantuya allah is my witness
1251493 les vrais ennemis du gabon ce sont les gabonais eux m mes
1251494 be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect
1251495 i felt very lonely and alone the opposition had a field day as they would stand up and say even your own people said so together with the local media they were campaigning to destroy me for all my four years as premier
1251496 i expected them to give me a service delivery audit report and show me where i have failed but they said abantu bathi people say you have failed honestly i dont think i have done that bad i have served the people of the eastern cape with great passion and they love me
1251497 the iphone 3g is easily the best touchscreen phone you can buy
1251498 the iphone 3g is easily the best touchscreen phone you can buy
1251499 i asked barack obama what he wanted for his birthday
1251500 as a white sox fan this hurts a little bit
1251501 id like to test creating updating and deleting appointments from different time zones from the desktop web and mobile interfaces to our calendar program
1251502 expecting life to treat you well because you are a good person is like expecting an angry bull not to charge because you are a vegetarian

1251507 ive recently been in contact with roger and hes actually working on the script right now
1251508 the forum requests the special rapporteur on the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples undertake a study on the united nations decolonization process and the special committee on decolonization to assess its historical and current impact on the human rights of indigenous peoples of the non self governing territories furthermore the forum requests the secretary general to undertake a mid decade review or the second decade on the eradication of colonialism to determine whether substantial progress has been made in achieving the goals of the second decade and to identify proposals for addressing obstacles to achieving the goals of the second decade
1251509 this album is part of a continuing collaboration between aboriginal maori torres strait islanders activists and artists using hip hop as a vehicle for indigenous self determination
1251510 there are common issues facing all indigenous peoples and hip hop music is a connection that we can use to spread the word
1251511 when the military come armed into our communities in places like the northern territory or like they did in ruatoki last year it is important that indigenous peoples support each other
1251512 we create music for a kaupapa for the generations to follow us we fight for the longevity of our mokopuna who will have a hard life if all the land is gone or polluted
1251513 samoa will not sacrifice its culture on the altar of globalization
1251514 sometimes its just a matter of picking some foundation plants like trees and shrubs
1251515 once those are in you can fill in the rest yourself
1251516 i try to suggest alternatives without advocating for any one particular option
1251517 i dont want them to attach me to the dispute but yes couples do disagree about what should happen in the garden
1251518 i know these people personally so i can be pretty sure that theyre somebody my clients will get along with
1251519 at this stage it is so early in the process that we are not aware of some of the challenges that obviously through the consultation we will be involved in all of the issues that are raised by local community
1251520 obviously through the consultation we will be involved in all of the issues that are raised by local community and obviously if certain things become prohibitive then obviously the tenders will not be granted
1251521 to make sure it complies with the minerals program that covers the whole of new zealand
1251522 also to make sure that theyre not sacrificing one part of the minerals industry for another so it has to be carefully considered

1251533 we want to tell in a very consistent style this great epic fantasy that terry has created
1251534 sometimes rob would break and make a funnier version of xena or hercules but we wont be doing that here
1251535 there is a great deal of humor in the books but its different for instance the character of zedd is a very funny character but the show will be very serious and straight well let the humor come out of the characters in the exact same way that terry did and that will translate directly to the screen
1251536 sus kala mo kung sinong maganda e pinagtyatyagaan ko lang naman sya pweh

1251579 live like no one else you know so that you can live like no one else you know
1251580 thanks to wines such as these i shant be needing the ch teauneuf du pape on my next visit to the enchanted valley
1251581 i kept getting calls from people who were not gardeners but they had a nice garden professionally installed and didnt really know what to do with it after that
1251582 they were afraid to move things around or try something new because it didnt really feel like their garden
1251583 they might even want to work alongside the professionals they hire not everybody works that way
1251584 i might just go to somebodys house four times a year and work in the garden with them for the afternoon
1251585 one of the things i really like to do is to help people connect with the seasons and know what to look out for as their garden changes over the year
1251586 it bothers me when people act like their knowledge is some big mysterious thing im not threatened by people who want to know what i know theres always going to be a need for gardening services the more i can get people involved with gardening the better
1251587 no necesitan otra herramienta mas como para perder el tiempo
1251588 the word we heard used most to describe the pirates return in these two trades was quantity which isnt always a compliment
1251589 i have to have better command think better im going to learn from this
1251590 i think weve got one of the better bullpens in our league
1251591 but we started putting those guys in long situations early on and bad things happen as you get deeper in the season we burned these guys out
1251592 bottom line your starters got to give you a shot
1251593 im feeling pretty good up there trying to take advantage of my time
1251594 weve said all along that we have to pitch better
1251595 when we do with the things weve seen our offense and bullpen can do good things are going to happen
1251596 well if you want to have some fun come down to 14th and well be here sexy
1251597 ive heard read all the press out of the enterprise 2 0 conference and want to know what it takes to get lotus connections going
1251598 are you kidding me the customer is already sold what am i even doing here
1251599 we are a multi national holding company with multiple subsidiaries each subsidiary has its own ldap user directory can we use lotus connections profiles to aggregate the data
1251600 additional address or contact information may be printed on the back of the card no other information is allowed
1251601 he was the most gracious man who treated everyone the same a sewer cleaner and a duchess
1251602 had a commitment to telling it like he believed it to be that never ever varied
1251603 he was just a very entertaining broadcaster and a very good one
1251604 i knew he wasnt feeling good but this was unexpected he hung the moon for me
1251605 some guy across the line from me would say good night skippy id get mad then the guy would knock me down and run right over me
1251606 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1251607 if videotapes were made they were likely used for translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1251608 there were four palestinians who were issued visas about whom we then received additional information
1251609 we decided that we needed to take a closer and harder look at them in light of the additional information we received
1251610 i asked barack obama what he wanted for his birthday
1251611 as a white sox fan this hurts a little bit
1251612 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terrorism against american victims
1251613 but after the pressure we applied libya will finally be held accountable for these devastating events
1251614 we knew we shouldnt expect to see something like that
1251615 the really cool thing is that all the details are still there
1251616 the existence of wet based glaciers proglacial lakes tundra vegetation and insect remains all indicate that the climate of the western olympus range was warmer and wetter that that of today
1251617 as it cools it crosses thresholds this is one when antarctica became permanently frozen and locked up
1251618 because if human beings are unfortunate enough to push climate over one of these thresholds it could be a total catastrophe
1251619 its imperative that we seek advice from independent experts and that we do so in a way that is public open and transparent
1251620 over time the percentage of people who have these conflicts will diminish
1251621 a lot of it will have to do with how much energy the fda is willing to expend to find people who dont have a conflict of interest
1251622 the fda has consistently used a very low standard for granting waivers and there is no evidence that this will change
1251623 by making the standard for waivers more stringent and improving the voting system the fda is moving closer toward ensuring the only interest taken into account during these advisory panels is that of the american people
1251624 simultaneous voting avoids voting momentum in which some voters may be influenced even subconsciously by the votes of those who precede them
1251625 is always pained to have to extend tours he understands the effect that has on the families of our forces but he also appreciates our commanders need to make additional progress while the weather is still good in afghanistan
1251626 barack and i as partners as friends and as lovers we accessorize each other in many ways
1251627 the best thing i love having on me is barack on my arm and vice versa whether its having him standing there smiling at me or watching him mesmerize a crowd or talk to some seniors in a senior center
1251628 my first job in all honesty is going to continue to be mom in chief
1251629 making sure that in this transition which will be even more of a transition for the girls that they are settled and that they know they will continue to be the center of our universe
1251630 tack on the fact that there is no sustained mental health support for these families as they are struggling with loved ones who are coming back dealing with emotional issues
1251631 youve got people in pain and we dont hear those voices a lot
1251632 i found it wasnt that barack wasnt interested in helping
1251633 its just that when the baby cried at 4 a m i got up faster than he did because i would hear the baby and i would be up
1251634 being fit has become even more important as ive had children because im also thinking about how im modeling health to my daughters
1251635 its imperative that we seek advice from independent experts and that we do so in a way that is public open and transparent
1251636 over time the percentage of people who have these conflicts will diminish
1251637 a lot of it will have to do with how much energy the fda is willing to expend to find people who dont have a conflict of interest
1251638 the fda has consistently used a very low standard for granting waivers and there is no evidence that this will change

1251640 simultaneous voting avoids voting momentum in which some voters may be influenced even subconsciously by the votes of those who precede them
1251641 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tuneups
1251642 the only thing ive heard him say is that we should inflate our tires
1251643 so he has no plan for addressing the energy challenges that we face
1251644 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets now big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2 million in contributions because instead of taxing their windfall profits to help drivers mccain wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another barack obama a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a 1 000 rebate a president wholl stand up for you
1251645 series today i finally get quickr entry see sometimes you have to use social software to really understand its value so let me tell you a brief story
1251646 ms marvel possesses the avengers team symbol she doesnt possess the skrulls team symbol
1251647 although it may be possible for a new u s administration to repudiate the disastrous bush policy
1251648 a tremendous amount of damage will already have been done
1251649 oh no google is indexing my content but not yahoo

1251652 plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer harm arising from the foregoing wrongful conduct by mr fortuny
1251653 and the manner in which he is viewed among family friends and colleagues
1251654 suffer and continue to suffer from humiliation embarrassment lost opportunity of keeping his family together and emotional distress
1251655 i did not obtain any information by intruding into plaintiffs personal space eavesdropping or illegally intercepting any communication
1251656 thus the disclosure of plaintiffs e mail is not by its nature personal or intrusive
1251657 to discuss how dmca law can be used to be chill free speech
1251658 dont tread on me or how i learned to stop worrying and ignore dmca threats
1251659 the counter notification basically says youre a liar liar pants on fire
1251660 and adds that if you dont respond within 14 days i get to put my shit back up
1251661 the use of the photo is in reduced form is transformative does not affect market value of the original photo and is for a purpose of education and public interest
1251662 there is ample case law that protects the fair use of reduced versions of media especially for the purposes of education and discussion
1251663 there was no malicious intent in my actions this was never a plan to embarrass people or to single out a subset of the population
1251664 if i made the mistake of telling secrets to someone i didnt know online and it got out id be kicking myself pretty hard i would most definitely be shouting expletives at my computer screen but thats the risk we all take online as well as in life whether its someones e mail picture or personal ad theres no guarantee of identity and no guarantee that you wont be betrayed and there never will be
1251665 agree not to post email or otherwise make available content that includes personal or identifying information about another person without that persons explicit consent
1251666 to be a private communication between himself and the woman who placed the advertisement the public disclosure of these private facts represents an intrusion upon the privacy of plaintiff that is objectionable and highly offensive to a reasonable person
1251667 the foregoing acts of infringement have been willful and intentional in complete disregard of and with indifference to plaintiffs rights
1251668 moreover the uncertainty of the extent of the intrusions continues to cause plaintiff a great deal of anguish and suffering
1251669 unless enjoined and restrained by this court mr fortuny will continue to cause plaintiff great and irreparable injury that cannot fully be compensated or measured in money
1251670 hey i think ill start a controversy today and get my face in the news
1251671 ive struggled to integrate this experience into my life and to make it productive
1251672 the larger issue of privacy on the internet and how to be proactive in protecting ones private information
1251673 b ringing legal action against me may punish me but it wont change or even impact online culture in the positive ways that i describe above
1251674 erode the free speech rights of internet users everywhere especially the growing world of bloggers and other self published groups when an individual uses copyright law and privacy torts to silence critics or unjustly control publicly relevant discussion it damages everyones rights
1251675 i am 27 yo sexy str8 woman 5 ft 7 in 145 lbs

1251677 i am looking 4 a white or latin only str8 brutal dom muscular male 30 35 yo who is arrogant self centered nasty egotistic sadistic who likes 2 give intense pain and discipline
1251678 protect your free speech rights stand up to copyright and dmca law abuse
1251679 here i am going pro se on this this is going to be fun
1251680 has something to annoy invigorate and agitate just about everybody
1251681 loyally prevaricate in eberts manner a criticism show owned and sponsored by the disney conglomerate
1251682 for that era enthralled with tax shelters bond trading and pro trust legislation
1251683 its not just for the journalism profession betraying its promise of news and ideas but also for those bloggers
1251684 with a hipster avant garde pack mentality an opinionated throng united in their sarcasm and intense pretense at intellectualizing what is basically a hobby
1251685 its mostly half baked overlong term paper essays by fans who like to think they think
1251686 if i wanted a laymans opinion on movies i dont have to watch tv
1251687 you can find out almost anything about the movies on the web
1251688 some of it will be true some will be pure invention a lot of it will be advertising
1251689 i am still cancer free and not ready to think about more surgery at this time
1251690 are you as bored with my health as i am
1251691 i still have all my other abilities including the love of viewing movies and writing about them
1251692 was a failure in every possible way except that i loved it
1251693 dont misconstrue this as an attack on the still convalescent ebert
1251694 i wish him nothing but health but i am trying to clarify where film criticism went bad
1251695 his simplistic denunciation of the meaning and impact of roger ebert who has done more to widen the tastes of the movie going public and popularize basic cinema literacy than any critic in the history of print is shameful and would be so even without the i wish him well as he recovers parenthetical
1251696 the discussion turned especially profound this week as a selection of esteemed critics moved on to slapping anyone and anything that would stand still long enough to absorb their blows
1251697 pioneered the case for the music video being one of the most significant postmodern art forms
1251698 white has interviewed few subjects and done only modest secondary research in his attempt to place the rap star in a larger social and cultural context
1251699 i cant believe that this max cant find something real to complain about in this crazy world i think max is the bigot he obviously hates country music country singers and southerners
1251700 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
1251701 but i think that thats what they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian

1251768 it will never ever happen we dont want to be one of those groups that comes back 15 years later and puts out an album thats not that good its why the beatles never got back together

1251774 this is the way things are get used to it
1251775 i dont know what white folks owe us but one thing i do know is that they wont pay
1251776 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
1251777 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
1251778 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
1251779 senator obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
1251780 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
1251781 plan for the future because that is where you are going to spend the rest of your life
1251782 besides how open public transparent in short social can you be with e mail as your only choice for collaboration and knowledge sharing isnt that a little bit limiting
1251783 wouldnt it be great if we had the freeness to record our thoughts and openly discuss new ideas with other employees across the enterprise
1251784 no god of mine would put light in such unrighteous eyes
1251785 youll spend the rest of your life trying hard to forget that you met the world naked and screaming and thats how youll leave it
1251786 no more cigarettes no more having sex no more drinking till you fall on the floor no more indie rock just a ticking clock you have no time for that anymore
1251787 after i looked again at the programmes of real madrid and oranje i came to the conclusion that i had to make a choice because of the necessary physical effort to achieve the maximum at this level
1251788 i still dont know whether i will continue at real madrid its not defined yet
1251789 the season is just starting and ive been given some offers from other clubs i have one from chelsea but nothing has been sorted out yet we are just discussing
1251790 watching the olympic team play on television is so bad
1251791 i wanted to be there with the group but real madrid did not want to release me i am truly sorry for that
1251792 not any one particular brand like hitting up a lot of the different ones at ben and jerrys but also other crazy brands
1251793 two sets over twins over there back in the motherland of ireland
1251794 the legal definition of torture has been much aired in recent years and i take mamma mia to be a useful contribution to that debate
1251795 anyone watching brosnan in mid delivery will conclude that he has recently suffered from a series of complex digestive problems and that the camera has with unfortunate timing caught him at the exact moment when he is finally working them out
1251796 id be dead emotionally at least if i hadnt met him
1251797 there are some days when even i think im overrated but not today
1251798 theres no road map on how to raise a family its always an enormous negotiation but i have a holistic need to work and to have huge ties of love in my life i cant imagine eschewing one for the other
1251799 everything pushed me over the edge the quiet dismantling of environmental regulations the phoniness of no child left behind everybody should be getting up and making a big fat noise

1251810 our family is aware there is a lot of speculation and conjecture about her situation within the community
1251811 i do not wish to go any further into the circumstances leading up to or surrounding her hospital admission
1251812 to do so publicly at this point is not in paulas best interests
1251813 there has been speculation within the media that paulas hospitalisation is in some way related to comments by sam newman on the footy show last thursday
1251814 this is not the case mr newmans comments are not in any way linked to paulas current health issues rather a culmination of personal and political pressure

1251829 it is important that the community understands she is not blaming anyone else
1251830 regular moisturizers are designed to add moisture onto the skin
1251831 however they dont repair the protective layer of the skin so its an endless cycle of constant moisture application onto the skin without healing and curing the dry skin
1251832 there are thousands of irritants in our environment that werent around decades ago
1251833 soaps shampoos and cleansers strip away the skins natural barrier i see many instances of contact dermatitis where the natural coating has been stripped just from daily use of soaps and other irritants at that point any chemical can enter the skin shielding lotion helps restore that barrier so the skin is protected against harsh chemicals it is an excellent skin care treatment product
1251834 more precious than peace the cold war and the struggle for the third world
1251835 to infer that the soviet terror is as hideous as hitlerism is not only a brutal oversimplification but a moral indecency
1251836 when every nation in europe must have the chance to choose its own tomorrow free from the shadows of yesterday
1251837 in bangladesh a quiet revolution war on rampant graft brings pain promises
1251838 a nation long plagued by natural disasters poverty corruption and violence may finally be on the verge of a happier future
1251839 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1251840 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1251841 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1251842 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1251843 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1251844 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1251845 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1251846 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1251847 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1251848 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1251849 one shouldnt look at the fly half position in isolation we were not selecting only a fly half
1251850 percy will never start at fly half while i coach but if we need to use him he will be there
1251851 if i had the choice i wouldnt have let them go being able to do that shows how privileged we are to have this depth
1251852 it is the most difficult thing for a coach to tell players they havent been selected especially in this case where no players has not been up to standard
1251853 all 28 fit players in the present squad deserve to be retained but unfortunately it cannot be done
1251854 we will make suggestions and advise and if a player has preferences we will consider that
1251855 we dont want to force a player into anything so that the fingers are later pointed at us
1251856 it was in the interest of the players themselves that we decided to release them to their unions so that they can get game time
1251857 surely that is better than just holding tackle bags all week
1251858 with this more open relationship with the unions we and the players will benefit
1251859 the first part of next week looks pretty nice too

1251867 in the past they had felt such a boundless understanding between them that their souls had as it were put their arms round each other
1251868 was there just a hint of mockery in his voice
1251869 its the wives of course they will resent you its only natural try to pity them
1251870 its difficult to find the words to describe this victory
1251871 we have a lot of people to thank right now you can just see the drivers but you mustnt forget all the people behind the scenes who probably worked harder than us for weeks day and night
1251872 i think the team did a really great job we did not make mistakes during the whole week
1251873 today is a day of celebration for us one and two
1251874 after the successful financing in the first quarter we have dedicated ourselves to our product development operations in the second quarter and have made significant progress across the portfolio
1251875 i would like to take the opportunity to thank kurt berlin for his outstanding contributions to epigenomics over the last ten years we are pleased that we can still leverage his expertise in dna methylation science and technology as well as intellectual property in the future
1251876 we believe that with our choice of senior vp product development we won the ideal successor to take over kurts responsibilities and to lead our product development programs into the next phase of epigenomics corporate development he will bring in the perfect mix of qualifications expertise and experience to drive the late stage development of our lead products through to commercialization due to a mutual understanding on confidentiality with his current employer we cannot disclose more details at this point but will do so as soon as possible
1251877 in addition to the significant progress we have made on the operational and product development side the first half has been characterized by stringent fiscal discipline coupled with revenue growth hence all our financials are in line with our expectations
1251878 hey everyone so weve had the same mp3s up for quite some time and we feel its time to put up an mp3 that added some twisted craziness to the terror syndrome album spinning backwards featuring devin townsend lead guitar and michael manring bass is officially up on our myspace player lots of you who have already bought the debut terror syndrome album off of itunes released july 10th 2008 have heard this song but for those who havent here you go this song is an instrumental and it was written by myself and dave young i really wanted to close the album out with something crazy and messed up to leave people thinking what the hell i told devin and michael to go nuts and do something really out there and they definitely did both of them did such an amazing job this turned out better than i could of imagined and youll know why the song it titled spinning backwards once youve heard it hope you guys enjoy the craziness thanks for all your support we get fan mail everyday saying how much you guys are digging the new album keep spreading the terror and let everyone know that the album is out world wide via itunes napster amazon mp3 rhapsody and more distributers digitally you all rule and well keep you posted on shows and touring news as it happens
1251879 this year we are better prepared and i believe profitability will improve
1251880 i dont think a rescue mission would be possible today
1251881 the weather is still bad flying in skardu and beyond was not possible this morning normally it takes two or three days to improve the weather in the area
1251882 our helicopters are ready waiting for an improvement in the situation they may try to make an attempt this evening if the weather improves even for a few hours
1251883 such missions are quick it may not take more than one or two hours to bring the climber down
1251884 they were far from me hours away but they were not turning around
1251885 but then i thought they know what they are doing
1251886 the organisation is very good but the pollution is no good
1251887 we stay in our bedrooms and the dining rooms not in the open
1251888 the polls were free fair and credible our candidates were elected mayors to all four cities where elections were held and eight out of nine municipalities
1251889 we went into the pre season cup with an attitude around getting some quality games under our belts but the further we went we started thinking hang on we can go somewhere and maybe have a shot at winning this
1251890 now were in the final we want to win it the feeling in the changeroom and at training is just unbelievable
1251891 the belief within the team is there thats what is really noticeable weve recruited well this year and weve got a good group of boys in but its the belief within the group thats key when youve got quality players onboard and everyone has faith in themselves and each other then everything else takes care of itself
1251892 the first competition game is the important one and theres still work to do before then but were in a final now and were going to try and win it hopefully we can take a winning feeling into the first game of the new season
1251893 its an honour obviously it was an unfortunate situation for andrew last weekend but its a big honour for me to lead this club out in a final and in front of our fans its doesnt get much better than that
1251894 for a club thats been around less than 18 months its a pretty significant achievement
1251895 we havent changed how weve gone about things in pre season weve covered all the bases and now were in a final melbourne are bringing a good side and itll be great for our fans to see another match at the ring of fire to have the final at home is unique and thats very positive for the club
1251896 if you look at history there is an example of regimes like the nazis taking power as a result of people leaving the ruling party
1251897 german people let the nazis take power leaving that consequence
1251898 this is not an issue that we can overlook we will demand an apology
1251899 hes rehydrating hes eating a little and getting some oxygen
1251900 anyway i can walk and i want to descend to the base camp
1251901 the armys pilots are still waiting for an improvement in the weather conditions and the moment they were allowed to fly they will pick up the italian mountaineer
1251902 everything was going well to camp four and on summit attempt everything went wrong
1251903 are holding up well and are very proud of gers achievement and are still in total shock in relation to the fact that he may not be coming back
1251904 at high altitude at over 8 000 meters 26 250 feet it is too dangerous to mount a rescue to have the bodies returned
1251905 the divide between rich and poor is rising at a troubling rate within subregions of asia pacific leaving vast numbers of mothers and children at risk
1251906 however the regions robust economic growth the fastest in the world since 1990 has lifted millions out of poverty
1251907 chinas overall disease profile now resembles that of an industrialized country but inequities in access to quality health care and huge disparities in health outcomes remain prevalent and entrenched
1251908 heat is a major enemy when it comes to high performance overclocking memory by adding airflow directly over the memory vortex can lower module temperatures up to 30 this means potentially higher performing memory with increased stability for running today s complex multi threaded applications which require high bandwidth low latency memory
1251909 it is wonderful to see an elderly dog get adopted as they are often overlooked and left to spend their last days at the centre
1251910 please call us if you are thinking of adopting a new dog for the staff here it is a vital and positive part of our work with dogs
1251911 we didnt try and get cute with this album and pick some out da box beats and get on some philosophy sh t we did what we knew best and that was rhyme about the street while of course infusing the humor that you know youre going to get when you listen to our rhymes
1251912 with the writers strike it took so long to get underway and roger avary the writer had a commitment that was in line before working the wolfenstein stuff but ive recently been in contact with roger and hes actually working on the script right now
1251913 i became a part of the lakeshore family and theyve seen me function through the last few years and felt it was time for me to do it
1251914 creating the werewolves the creatures and the sets for underworld i think for them it only seemed logical that i direct the next chapter what appealed to me was that this time were talking about the story of the lycans not the vampires anymore im happy to carry on the legacy of what len created it gave me a chance to do a new take on the series while still retaining the style seeing the movie with a different eye got excited me the most
1251915 when len wrote the first movie he created a trilogy in his mind already
1251916 and one of the stories he wanted to tell was the story of lucian its an earlier time in the story so its more primeval in a sense it allowed me to be a bit bolder and a bit more hardcore about the material i really tried to keep the tone of underworld in there so at the end of the day hopefully there will be a balance for people
1251917 you know youre in an underworld film when you get that
1251918 when we started to create the weaponry for the medieval time i wanted it to be more modern in some ways
1251919 which is interesting because it is a period piece and we tried to be accurate within that time however the vampires are eternal theyre from every time so you have that leeway when creating stuff like cross bows we have some bad ass cross bows
1251920 its not so much orchestra it feels like a modern movie thats set up in a period piece
1251921 my position was bring them in and let them breathe let them do their thing then as i see what theyre doing i try to guide them into my vision my world it worked out really well michael became very passionate about the project bill what do you do with him he knows the character more than youll ever know hes an incredible gentleman he would pull me aside and say patrick tell me if im going overboard he would put you at ease i was very lucky
1251922 this goes back to the 12th century and it becomes theatrical and big
1251923 i think its brilliant and hilarious i grew up with two brothers and one of them is a comic book junkie hes an investment banker but hes got a whole room dedicated to comic books im not as well versed as him but i have a genuine love for that world i think its fantastical any excuse to get dressed up all of it makes sense to me vampires werewolves i have a four year old nephew who thinks its amazing more impetus for me to do this
1251924 i had a lot of training from my previous work and when i came to this i hadnt done much with swords i did a little bit before but it was a case of
1251925 bill nighy and i were just talking about what gets us through it and you get so involved in telling the story everything else disappears except for when youre on about take fifteen and its the end of the day
1251926 your leather chaps are starting to feel about 500 tons and you dont know if you can do it anymore because you cant move
1251927 you dont even question it you just believe them you just believe bill is a vampire hes my dad but hes a vampire and there are moments i was genuinely shaken up
1251928 those are beautiful costumes and the men wearing them talk about suffering for your art a little bit
1251929 we were in new zealand so i know it was quite hot for them there were beautiful locations down there a nice respite
1251930 in many companies and sectors pay arrangements are still covered by the current agreement if no national agreement emerges and where existing pay agreements have expired claims will be processed in line with established industrial relations procedures
1251931 the collapse of the pay talks further dispels the myth of s supposed competence on the economy the government found it easy to broker a deal between unions and employers when they could pay for it through the proceeds of a debt fuelled boom and explosion in public spending
1251932 now that the government is facing a tougher economic climate its entire economic policy is unravelling with unemployment rising house prices falling business and consumer confidence plummeting and nothing on offer from the government to tackle any of the problems facing the economy
1251933 for the avoidance of doubt about what trade unions were prepared to contemplate in an national agreement we were prepared to accept that it would be somewhat better than inflation for the lower paid whilst it might be something less than inflation for the better paid
1251934 the kildare route project is being delivered on schedule and on budget and its completion and the major capacity benefits it will deliver are now only 18 months away
1251935 everything was going well to camp four and on summit attempt everything went wrong
1251936 the biggest mistake we made was that we tried to make agreements
1251937 everybody had his own responsibility and then some people did not do what they promised
1251938 there was a korean guy hanging upside down there was a second korean guy who held him with a rope but he was also in shock and then a third guy was there also and they were trying to survive but i had also to survive
1251939 everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody were leaving each other
1251940 i didnt have time to start discussion the only thing i had to do was to go down because if you go down you have more oxygen you have more chance to survive
1251941 marco confortola is being accompanied by four rescuers and most probably hell be brought tonight to the advance base camp abc that is at an altitude of 6 000 metres
1251942 up there it was hell during the descent beyond 8 000 metres due to the altitude and the exhaustion i even fell asleep in the snow and when i woke up i could not figure out where i was mr confortola said
1251943 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
1251944 emusic is the worlds largest retailer of independent music and the worlds second largest digital music retailer overall offering more than 2 million tracks from more than 13 000 independent labels
1251945 acts of violence and intimidation such as these are unacceptable and they continue a troubling pattern seen at ucla and other uc campuses that should be repugnant to us all
1251946 these acts threaten not only our academic researchers and their families but the safety and security of neighbors in our communities as well
1251947 we as a community are unambiguous in our condemnation of these actions let me be clear this is not protest this is terrorism
1251948 prior to that the vast majority of actions taken were against institutions break into the lab steal the animals trash the facility
1251949 more recently however theyve become much more personal attacking the researchers at their homes california seems to be the focus of this activity right now but not the only focus
1251950 i think its a form of domestic terrorism intended to intimidate people
1251951 these are incidents that could have killed someone they are obviously intended to prevent researchers from pursuing the advancement of knowledge they are a serious attack on academic freedom
1251952 preach this we respect all living things and then they do that with children in the house
1251953 the inconvenience and the suffering of any children or any family members pales in comparison to the suffering and oppression that goes on in these animal laboratories
1251954 putting himself and his family in harms way by continuing to abuse animals
1251955 for rational people this violence is not the way you exercise your opinions in a democratic society
1251956 we support our colleagues in the sciences and the academic freedom that goes along with being a professor
1251957 whats this world coming to this is the justice center but theres no justice here another police acquittal he killed that mother he shot her and her child this is just great
1251958 weve had members of our community called to jury duty
1251959 obviously theyve rendered their verdict and thats all we could have asked for a fair concise and attentive look at the evidence they paid attention they listened and this is what theyve rendered
1251960 i dont think any of us are pleased with the fact that this whole incident occurred and the impact its had on the family and others
1251961 i am glad we were able to get through this in a positive way its still going to be a situation a tough situation the community is going to have to deal with
1251962 when was he ever on the side with the community
1251963 hopefully the fbi will pick it up as a community weve got to move on weve got to do better than what were doing
1251964 it was undisputable it was so crystal clear as to what happened inside that house i left that courtroom after closing arguments saying theres no way theyre going to find him guilty just looking at the lifeless faces of the jurors and how desensitized they were to the horror that was described as a community we have to do whatever we can do now people are going to want to stand up and protest youre going to have the so called leadership now wanting to have press conferences and have discussions but they didnt want to come out and support this family
1251965 with the verdicts there are going to be a lot of different viewpoints on this in the community this week and over the next months
1251966 however whether we agree with the verdicts or not we have to remember this is the system and weve got to honor the system and try to work through these problems
1251967 when i think about things that have happened in this city i can say i expected this to happen
1251968 people are tired of it african americans get prison sentences two to three times longer than whites
1251969 if theyd arrested anthony terry the target of the raid tarika wilson would still be alive
1251970 they purchased from him seven times before they arrested him and they could have arrested him earlier that day
1251971 and he chavalia was only facing misdemeanors he should have had some god in him and said you know what i am sorry and i made a mistake i really didnt mean to kill her now you have a family thats going to be torn up and with him being found not guilty hes going to be on the police department tomorrow now how do i go out into the streets and the black the community and tell my brothers let the law prevail how do i tell them that when the law wont even handle their own
1251972 the one unanimous conclusion was that we were grossly disappointed but not surprised by the verdict the justice system does not work for all people in our community and it is time for change we will continue to pursue justice and righteousness by forming a coalition for change we need a new direction and together we can change our community
1251973 do i think theres going to be violence in the community
1251974 no we understand the importance of rebuilding the community however the reality is there are some serious issues that need to be addressed
1251975 im not saying he went up there and intentionally killed her but he should be held accountable for his mistake
1251976 no one intended to kill anyone here there was a threat and joe responded to it
1251977 joe was justified in what he did and it was not just a random shooting
1251978 i think the difference was we presented the case so everyone could understand it and kept hammering home certain points
1251979 joe would want the community to move on and help stop the gang violence that is going on
1251980 if we couldnt justify it based on joes conduct in this case every officer on a swat raid from this point on would be thinking well look what happened to joe chavalia
1251981 i think the only reason the grand jury returned the indictment in this case and ill be real blunt about this is because they thought they had to respond to what was going on in the community had this case waited two or three months going to the grand jury it might have been different
1251982 come on six babies would have been screaming and carrying on
1251983 unfortunately i dont believe that he will be an officer in lima anymore and thats limas loss
1251984 its what we know when we go in that is the most important thing knowing theyre in there a head of time
1251985 i believe it is imperative that bill deweese resign as house majority leader
1251986 we need a cultural change we need leaders who are committed to transformational reform we need a monumental shift and we need it now
1251987 saddened that josh would take this public shot at me
1251988 this stuff shall pass and well move on as an institution
1251989 delegation of power allows him to focus on big picture goals
1251990 in a moment of decision the best thing you can do is the right thing the worst thing you can do is nothing
1251991 we started to work on ipoki when the firsts gps enabled mobile phones were put on the market we notice that there were some services on the market about geolocation without its democratic internet version open and free first we started creating some location based services like put and get alerts fro users around specific places but then we realize that we need to add social features to our services if we want to make it really massive opened and easy for every possible internet user so we decided to create a social network based on location sharing people share photos videos and a lot of things over the internet and we think that it would be very interesting to share your location in real time with accuracy like some pay services plus social features finally we have added new services to our social network like integrations with twitter flickr or facebook
1251992 i think we work with very cutting edge technology in an early stage today every cell phone has a camera in the future they also will have a gps build in and low cost internet access location based services and social networks could be the next generation of social services in internet we think we are going to be on one of those little links that compose the chain that will join the physical with the virtual in the next web
1251993 we have launched a new integration with qik com to share your location in realtime and send livevideo with your mobile devices all at the same time

1251998 it is the nation who is in distress we are facing economic uncertainty and the citizens are facing all sorts of difficulties facing it we are losing our competitive edge and we are losing our territories too

1252028 make sure you leave some stuff behind so i know youll be back
1252029 wed like to think were on track but well find out on saturday if our speed has picked up
1252030 we were pretty disappointed with the world cup results we asked what we could do different technique wise and coach chris nilsson has been on our case with that
1252031 the double has been a great crew to pace with theyre consistent as hell they never have an easy session and youve got to work for your money every time
1252032 weve tried to get back a bit more easy speed as our coach would put it thats so you dont get halfway down the track and youre a bit more worn out than everyone else so youve got more in the tank to kick on
1252033 weve just tried to get it all together and get back what we thought we had we didnt realise wed lost a lot of speed
1252034 its a simple sport and you sometimes ask why cant we do what we were able to do a year ago were just trying to get that speed back
1252035 im just going through the same processes ive always gone through every day in training im trying to improve and yesterday was probably the best day out training for a number of months

1252130 there were also high levels of poverty in the area after the conflict
1252131 we thought the best way of getting effective aid to these people was cash
1252132 if the markets work there is no point in us buying goods taking them to the area and distributing them we might not get the type of goods required right and there are also issues to do with trucking food cash made much more sense
1252133 these people are mobile so they can go wherever they can get cheap food and the mobiles reduced their isolation
1252134 if there is money the food will come merchants will come people suffer because they cant buy
1252135 we found that one mobile phone per large group of people is not enough we will need to get more phones
1252136 most of the projects that have used the mobile phone technology have been small in scale and preliminary probably due the high costs of developing and deploying mobile technologies
1252137 provided the difference between wholesale and retail prices is within a certain range local food markets are actually functioning and that the cash transfer programme is long enough to justify the costs of the equipment phones chargers etc

1252153 intelligence centers run by states across the country have access to personal information about millions of americans including unlisted cellphone numbers insurance claims and credit reports
1252154 the centers use law enforcement analysts and sophisticated computer systems to compile or fuse disparate tips and clues and pass along the refined information to other agencies they are expected to play important roles in national information sharing networks that link local state and federal authorities and enable them to automatically sift their storehouses of records for patterns and clues the list of information resources was part of a survey conducted last year officials familiar with the effort said it shows that like most police agencies the fusion centers have subscriptions to private information broker services that keep records about americans locations financial holdings associates relatives firearms licenses and the like

1252183 weed killers were found in tap water of 28 out of 29 cities tested the results of these tests reveal widespread contamination of tap water with many different pesticides at levels that present serious health risks we estimate that 45 000 infants in these 29 cities drank infant formula reconstituted with tap water contaminated with multiple weed killers
1252184 it is deeply troubling that children including bottle fed infants will begin drinking fluoridated water without the benefit of the warning and in spite of the many other serious concerns about fluoridation raised by the national academy of sciences last spring
1252185 public water supplies should be safe for all consumers young and old alike
1252186 infants less than one year old may be getting more than the optimal amount of fluoride
1252187 if using a product that needs to be reconstituted parents and caregivers should consider using water that has no or low levels of fluoride

1252204 will yield far less than the maximum recoveries available to stakeholders
1252205 management and its advisers continue to resist our efforts to obtain
1252206 to date management has conditioned our access to information upon us agreeing to give up inherent rights of a stakeholder including our right to make a proposal without managements prior approval and has ceded to centerbridge material decision making authority regarding the terms of access to information
1252207 the efforts of management and its advisers in concert with centerbridge to exclude interested investors from the process will inevitably ensure that no alternative competitive proposals ever materialize

1252223 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
1252224 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
1252225 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil

1252239 teaching is a noble profession we are analysing feedback received from teachers and their organisations in this regard what i can tell at this time is that we could propose certain measures to ensure that their problems are sorted out and more people take an interest in joining the profession
1252240 we will take a minimum of another three months to compile and study the data then the report would be submitted
1252241 developing cold feet before joining the sector owing to the poor package
1252242 there are only six people on this committee it is obvious that we will take time to complete our study but our recommendations will be helpful to the teaching fraternity
1252243 the committee hopes that the states will be convinced to think more positively in their own interest for sparing adequate resources for higher education
1252244 pay revision is but an inescapable and most crucial step towards attracting and retaining the talented people to the teaching profession none of the states can afford to lag behind anymore

1252543 god is generous maybe things will be better when my children get older and my exhaustion to raise them is over
1252544 the governor has been pushing for a compromise between legislative leaders and budget reform must be part of any agreement
1252545 weve said all along that everything is on the table and were not going to balance the budget by cutting education and health care
1252546 people should not have to pay dearly with more of their hard earned dollars
1252547 i cannot envision any republican legislator supporting such a proposal
1252548 if this is the governors solution to our budget crisis were in big trouble
1252549 were seeing higher prices for food gasoline and it seems like not only the state but every local agency is reaching for our wallets
1252550 but wed be concerned about only a temporary fix to what are long term needs
1252551 its not like the health care needs of californians are going to go away in three years
1252552 its an example of a number of computer systems in which the state made a large investment decades ago and has been keeping it going the last few years with duct tape
1252553 pragmatically we just cant get the system to work in a timely manner for us to implement payment of minimum wage
1252554 we have not been provided with the evidence that would show us that this is an impossibility nor does it answer the question of why arent we working on this for next time
1252555 the point is the law needs to be adhered to and the governor is saying we need to follow the law and if the controller is saying its inconvenient i think the controller needs to explain why inconvenience is a reason to ignore the law
1252556 its certainly not a language that is taught oftentimes you have to rely on retired annuitants to come back and help maintain the system until youre able to find a replacement
1252557 no one relishes the high expense of these things compared to other programs they have to spend money on
1252558 redoing computer systems on the level of californias size and scope with our number of employees and bargaining units is a complicated effort its sort of natural that people havent jumped at the opportunity to make those large investments
1252559 i thought it was really really beautiful and very healing

1252564 if a detainee were transferred to canada any decisions regarding the applicable legal proceedings that may be available in respect of the detainees conduct outside of canada would be dependent upon the nature of the evidence available and admissible in a canadian proceeding to determine if their sic was a reasonable prospect of conviction as well as an assessment as to the public interest in proceeding with a prosecution

1252606 pc for now is what were focusing on but there is a console future for the franchise
1252607 we havent really talked about what thats going to be but one thing were focused on as folks probably have seen in regards to mass effect on the pc is whenever we do a platform choice were very definitive and very specific we dont splash it across all the platforms like in the case with mass pc we worked really hard to make it even better than the console version the pc gives us more tools to do that with thats the approach were taking with dragon age and other games at bioware
1252608 were seeing record levels of industry growth and success for our business and our industry so i think that bodes really well for what were going to be able to achieve in future years
1252609 by the same token the companys doing pretty well and were really happy with what were doing

1252669 the reason for writing i is the orthographic habit in the middle ages of using a long i that is j or i whenever the letter was isolated or formed the last letter of a group the numeral one was written j or i and three iij etc just as much as the pronoun

1252681 one of the most pernicious writers is steven plaut a man who could be thought of as israels daniel pipes
1252682 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1252683 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1252684 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1252685 one of the most pernicious writers is steven plaut a man who could be thought of as israels daniel pipes
1252686 weve spent a trillion or so dollars 30 000 dead or wounded a large loss in international influence and prestige all for the sake of disarming a country with no wmds
1252687 my concern right from the beginning was that the war wouldnt be worth the effort it would require and that the american people dont have a good record in supporting long costly struggles in developing countries
1252688 you know the standard bok chicken noise of living now is so bok high bok kok gas prices bok are bok soaring bok kok taxi driver pauses briefly yeah my response bok tell them i wish i could bok go to utah bok kok to visit them booooook
1252689 people describe me as a saint trying to be a politician but the truth is the other way around
1252690 those other three are synergys tour guides nightdreamer came along to pretend to be a tour guide like being a tour guide was a walter mitty fantasy of snoopy
1252691 when you have someone so young with so much promise and so much life taken from you is unspeakably devastating
1252692 this is such a tragedy for our family akira was so full of life
1252693 but we take comfort in the knowledge that she is with the lord
1252694 whatever ones religion in his private life may be for the officeholder nothing takes precedence over his oath to uphold the constitution and all its parts including the first amendment and the strict separation of church and state
1252695 if my church attempted to influence me in a way which was improper or which affected adversely my responsibilities as a public servant sworn to uphold the constitution then i would reply to them that this was an improper action on their part it was one to which i could not subscribe
1252696 we do not want an official state church if ninety nine percent of the population were catholics i would still be opposed to it i do not want civil power combined with religious power i want to make it clear that i am committed as a matter of deep personal conviction to separation
1252697 voters are more than catholics protestants or jews they make up their minds for many diverse reasons good and bad to submit the candidates to a religious test is unfair enough to apply it to the voters is divisive degrading and wholly unwarranted
1252698 i believe the american people are more concerned with a mans views and abilities than with the church to which he belongs i believe the founding fathers meant it when they provided in article vi of the constitution that there should be no religious test for public office and i believe that the american people mean to adhere to those principles today
1252699 i believe in an america where the separation of church and state is absolute where no catholic prelate would tell the president should he be catholic how to act and no protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the president who might appoint him or the people who might elect him
1252700 i believe in an america that is officially neither catholic protestant nor jewish where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the pope the national council of churches or any other ecclesiastical source where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all
1252701 since they have walked among the saber toothed cats in the pleistocene period and have miraculously survived the changing earth conditions until this time they have been a symbol of conservation thats why its no wonder the
1252702 they want to get rid of these old lpns so theyre going to come up with any reason they can think of
1252703 youd be surprised how many people violate this simple principle every day of their lives and try to fit square pegs into round holes ignoring the clear reality that things are as they are
1252704 recent clinical findings highlight the relationship between controlling acute blood pressure and lower risk of adverse outcomes
1252705 with the approval of cleviprex physicians have a new treatment option for intensive control of blood pressure that may advance the standard of care in the operating room the intensive care unit and the emergency department
1252706 in the last decade there have been no new iv antihypertensive agents introduced to the market
1252707 cleviprex presents physicians with a valuable option to effectively treat a broad array of patients who need rapid and precise blood pressure control
1252708 with the approval of cleviprex the medicines company continues to deliver on its vision of advancing innovation in the critical care setting
1252709 come on youve been working here long enough to know how tod o that right
1252710 they want to get rid of these old lpns so theyre going to come up with any reason they can think of
1252711 presidential candidate barack obama wants to bring chicago style politics to washington
1252712 with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1252713 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1252714 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1252715 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1252716 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1252717 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1252718 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1252719 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1252720 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1252721 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1252722 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1252723 you have no idea what you are about to face

1252737 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
1252738 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
1252739 turning cb1 back on and then treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
1252740 people have looked at cannabinoids in cancer earlier mainly in cell culture experiments
1252741 the molecular mechanisms for loss of the receptor and its effect on cancer have not been previously shown
1252742 just increasing the levels of cannabinoids to treat colorectal cancer wont work if the cb1 receptor is not present
1252743 data from our randomized placebo controlled trial involving a long duration of observation inject a note of caution into the debate regarding the use of gh therapy in the hiv population
1252744 low dose physiological gh is well tolerated and results in significant but more modest reduction in visceral adipose tissue vat abdominal fat but is nonetheless associated with increased glucose levels therefore the therapeutic window to achieve an optimal risk benefit ratio of gh in individuals with hiv abdominal fat accumulation and insulin resistance may be very narrow and difficult to achieve
1252745 growth hormone is not yet fda approved for the treatment of abdominal fat accumulation in patients with hiv other more potent strategies to safely increase gh and reduce vat including the use of gh releasing hormone ghrh may be more beneficial in addition strategies using diet exercise and lifestyle change may be more cost effective in the long run than gh particularly in patients with hiv visceral adiposity and insulin resistance in whom changes in glucose may be counterproductive

1252747 ik heb ze samen met de patissier van het hotel hier gemaakt
1252748 ze bestaat uit verschillende lagen met op de bodem van het deeg een pesto van tomaat daarboven een kaviaar van aubergine dan courgetteschijfjes en helemaal bovenaan gele en rode kerstomaatjes het geheel werd een tiental minuutjes in de oven gestopt en daarna hebben we ze laten afkoelen in de koelkast
1252749 de vorige jaren was dat slechts in een op de drie gevallen
1252750 daardoor kunnen vreemde arbeidskrachten via een vereenvoudigde procedure al na enkele dagen een werkvergunning krijgen
1252751 nog een opvallende vaststelling is dat we enorm veel inbreuken vaststellen bij bouwprojecten in opdracht van de overheid
1252752 een jaarlijkse grote reis behoort voor veel belgen tot de basisbehoeften daar wordt niet snel aan geraakt
1252753 maar citytrips gelden vaak als een tweede of derde reis en extraatje dus en daar wordt wel op bespaard
1252754 maar daar kunnen mensen met de trein naartoe en ook de goedkope britse pond speelt hier een niet te onderschatten rol
1252755 het blijft vroeg om hier al formele conclusies uit te trekken maar we verwachten toch dat we wat citytrips en korte reisjes betreft de zomer afsluiten met verlies het is nog afwachten of en hoe die tendens zich voortzet maar het is bijna zeker dat een stijging dit jaar niet meer te verwachten valt
1252756 mensen zullen meer gebruikmaken van de trein of de wagen om zo de brandstoftoelagen die veel vliegtuigmaatschappijen vragen te omzeilen ook wordt er geopteerd voor goedkopere hotels of de vakantie wordt ingekort
1252757 in het verleden hebben we al gemerkt dat koopkrachtproblemen en hoge brandstofprijzen wel degelijk een invloed hebben op de reisuitgaven
1252758 het is dus aan de sector om rekening te houden met de huidige economische factoren die geven aan dat we dit jaar waarschijnlijk geen mooie groei zullen realiseren goedkopere formules zullen extra in de verf gezet moeten worden
1252759 de impact van wanbetalingen in het primesegment zal veel groter zijn
1252760 una mentida repetida mil vegades es converteix en una veritat
1252761 a novel arsenical has antitumor activity toward as2o3 resistant and mrp1 abcc1 overexpressing cell lines
1252762 this study suggests that darinaparsin may have a broader therapeutic spectrum than inorganic arsenic as it is less affected by the resistance mechanisms of certain cancer cells
1252763 the successful application of a treatment that offers inorganic arsenics efficacy in acute promyelocytic leukemia to other more common malignancies would be significant i look forward to seeing more data from ongoing clinical and pre clinical studies
1252764 if i am a woman whose partner has sex outside marriage and he is 60 protected his chances of infecting me are reduced by 60
1252765 a critical mass of circumcised men will have been created reducing chances of infecting their partners
1252766 the intervention could be used to provide a range of other services such as couple counselling domestic violence interventions and condom promotion this will indirectly protect women against infections and other social ills like gender based violence
1252767 medical male circumcision is not a men only intervention women also benefit when we are looking at behaviour change women are our biggest allies
1252768 women are going to play a critical role in the success of this intervention as mothers opinion leaders and partners to their spouses if your partner gets circumcised and two days later you demand sex you will have failed the intervention
1252769 recent evidence suggests that in many cases tumor cells have already seeded metastatic sites even when the primary tumor is diagnosed at an early stage
1252770 we hope that with additional studies we can begin to discover new ways to therapeutically keep the dormant to active switch in the off position thus limiting the chance that micrometastases become active in later life
1252771 as rising petrol prices continue to put pressure on all motorists lpg offers an affordable solution that is already widely available mr reuss said
1252772 it gives motorists access to large car benefits at small car fuel costs
1252773 our global distribution diversified earning streams and strong capital position continue to help us support customers in todays challenging market conditions
1252774 as the outlook for 2008 remains uncertain we remain alert to the risks but we also see opportunity ahead
1252775 hsbc in australia will continue to position itself in those sectors and businesses where we have a fundamental competitive advantage and where we expect sustainable long term growth
1252776 weighing up the available domestic and international information the board judged that the cash rate should remain unchanged this month
1252777 nonetheless with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1252778 looking further ahead inflation in both cpi and underlying terms is likely to decline over time given the outlook for demand provided wages growth remains moderate the banks forecast remains that inflation will fall below 3 per cent during 2010
1252779 there are concerns the economy may be slowing faster than expected senior analyst lee wai tuck said from singapore
1252780 the economy may slow we dont use the word recession the economy may slow too quickly
1252781 we do have to remember inflation is at a 16 year high so the rba is not going to be rushed into cutting interest rates anz senior economist katie dean said
1252782 with the special protocol assessment in hand and two positive large phase 3 trials that met their primary and important secondary endpoints the tesamorelin program is steadily progressing towards a nda submission with a targeted market approval by the end of 2009
1252783 at a recent conference organized by the american heart association and the american academy of hiv medicine it was emphasized that hiv positive patients who adhered to their hiv medications had fewer complications than patients who took their antiretroviral regimens intermittently
1252784 since stress related to body image may actually lead patients to discontinue or alter their hiv treatments reducing this stress could be very beneficial
1252785 long term impact of tesamorelin th9507 a growth hormone releasing factor analogue on body image parameters in hiv infected patients with excess abdominal fat
1252786 results from the 26 week confirmatory phase 3 trial of tesamorelin th9507 a growth hormone releasing factor analogue in hiv patients with excess abdominal fat a multi center double blind placebo controlled study with 404 randomized patients
1252787 actually i like the ending i liked how the guy got the girl
1252788 i was saying that we have to get you home
1252789 im not going to leave i just have to work tomorrow you can call me tomorrow
1252790 would you like to tell me what happened this morning
1252791 i didnt know that this was going to hurt you
1252792 of course this hurt me you never told me that she loved you why couldnt you tell me first before you hurt me just as bad do you have any idea what you have done
1252793 sayu calm down i didnt know that i would fall in love with her it just happened
1252794 you have to believe me i was in the same position too
1252795 look i swear that i will tell you how it happened okay
1252796 these top line results with boceprevir are very exciting especially given that genotype 1 is the most common and hardest to treat form of hepatitis c
1252797 boceprevir was well tolerated by patients in this study including those who received 48 weeks of boceprevir in the longer duration treatment arms
1252798 these top line results further validate this novel treatment paradigm and the design of our pivotal phase iii studies of boceprevir one in treatment naive patients and one in patients who had failed prior treatment in which all patients will receive 4 weeks of pegintron and rebetol prior to the addition of boceprevir
1252799 additionally this strategy has the potential to reduce the likelihood of the development of resistance by identifying patients who are responders to interferon and ribavirin prior to their receiving a protease inhibitor

1252811 we love our cars but we just cant afford to fill the tank any more we used to get together for weekend drives to the country one weekend every month but now it is every two months and we dont go far out of sydney
1252812 so it takes us a full tank to get to crookwell where we used to go every winter and another tank back
1252813 city people cant afford to drive out here like they used to
1252814 it was assumed that petrol prices would impact on the tourism industry but nobody expected the traditional australian family holiday to have changed so much
1252815 with families wanting to cut their travel to reduce petrol costs tourist destinations further from metropolitan areas could suffer particularly in areas already struggling with the effects of drought
1252816 the decision by families to slash their spending by up to 500 and to holiday closer to home means an urgent campaign is needed to boost local tourism
1252817 almost 20 per cent of the tourist destinations the nrma surveyed said they would be forced to lay staff off and a further 55 per cent will have to cut back on operating costs
1252818 if ever we needed a motivation to end the nations dependence on foreign oil and transform australias transport energy future once and for all then this is it
1252819 given the heavy use of seatbelts by both drivers and passengers in australia we believe that front seat belt warnings are a little anachronistic

1252823 i told him that i will talk to hamid karzai when i meet him
1252824 when i visited the united states last month i met there president george bush besides all other relevant officials
1252825 since they are in coalition both at the centre and the provinces they will not go away
1252826 the last four or five days obviously weve been in a lot of discussions and a lot of meetings and talked over a lot of different scenarios but we were never real close to what i would call making a deal
1252827 sure there was interest in ron mahay as there was interest in all our relief pitchers every single one of them but we just werent motivated to move them unless somebody comes and knocks your socks off with a deal that you cant afford not to do
1252828 no its an absolute lie im not going to call them rumors anymore im just going to call them lies theres so much stuff thats just laughable
1252829 we made it pretty clear were committed to those guys together thats not to say that from time to time people dont inquire in casual conversation but its just not something were interested in doing unless of course it makes perfect sense and you have to do it
1252830 i thought we accomplished a lot in our discussions and possibly laid the groundwork for further opportunities to improve our team
1252831 the proposed tax hike has had a devastating impact on new car sales
1252832 it is clear that the downturn has been exacerbated by the impact of this unfair tax hike and the industry has significant concerns that orders will continue to be affected in coming months
1252833 if this situation continues the government will not receive the additional revenue it had projected and there is a real risk that it will cost jobs

1252835 the survey shows quite startlingly that the impact of slowing domestic demand is starting to take its toll on australian business accis director of industry policy and economics greg evans said in canberra
1252836 encouragingly on the inflation front both wage and non wage costs have indeed moderated as have business input prices he said
1252837 acci considers moderation in wage and non wage growth as well as declining business confidence and profit growth reduce the possibility of a wage price inflation spiral despite headline inflation hitting a 13 year high of 4 5 per cent in the year to june mr evans said
1252838 given the notable slowing in growth acci considers that an interest rate cut should be considered as early as possible

1252850 i think at this point that the minister became open to ideas he appears to be genuinely interested in finding solutions
1252851 i really dont know what hes going to come up with i get the impression that hes trying to satisfy everybody
1252852 i think there may be a sense that peoples opinions have been heard
1252853 as to the reaction i think it depends on what the minister decides
1252854 i think its important that a certain process has been undertaken but well really only know if the process was valuable once we have the decision
1252855 there was little opportunity for debate and a decision was made in about two weeks one week of which was the march break school vacation

1253141 now that e3 for 2008 is over and weve had a chance to see a bit more id like to add ten more to the list of upcoming games that seem to offer some new gaming environments or twists on existing ones that might help make for more interesting gameplay as i said before i know there is much more to gaming than gameplay environment but it is what sets the scene and keeps the visual interest of the gamer more and more we are also seeing greater interaction with the environment which means it becomes more than just background eye candy

1253148 its not the characters themselves that make for compelling stories but character relationships
1253149 perhaps it is the nature of the medium perhaps it is a consequence of these games being created largely by writers rather than teams of programmers designers and artists im not sure but i know i have yet to play a graphical game that deals with the nuance of character relationships the same way that some if games have so far been able to
1253150 why adventure games suck and what we can do about it
1253151 finally ive reached this level please tell me im near the end
1253152 conservative houses and imprints deserve credit for their innovation in utilizing the new conservative media and their stubbornness in getting the word out but their efforts dont change the fact that mainstream press bias still distances their books from what mortimer adler termed the great conversation the ongoing dialogue at the upper echelons of american intellectual life about the crucial moral and intellectual questions
1253153 we must already endure endless combats and trivial errand running to reach our goal that is certainly work enough why make it any more difficult
1253154 steve meretzky dave lebling and marc blank commented on my weblog
1253155 doing restaurant is not my dream come true but i do have paternal feelings about the hitchhikers if series and i agree with those who think that letting magnetic scrolls do restaurant would be overall a big mistake i think wed do a significantly better job and thats good economically for infocom and good aesthetically for the hitchhikers series
1253156 i told you dont worry youll get it back eventually good tea by the way
1253157 people love stories and many will get excited by the idea of getting plunked down into the middle of a good one
1253158 i find new people most often clamor for better and more engaging stories that actually keep them interested in what the heck is going on
1253159 stories are about characters the thing that if does least well is representing characters in the fictional world doubtless youve already read all the threads about npc characterisation so i wont recapitulate all that except to say that i believe that if we were able to implement strong ai tomorrow it wouldnt mean that wed be able to tell better stories because the presence of an ai in the world would be the representation of an artificial person and characters are not people characters are fictional simplifications of people constructed for a dramatic purpose this is what gives me hope that if can surmount the hurdle of presenting convincing characters and so come good on the fiction bit of if
1253160 i think good coding can help a lot in creating realistic npcs
1253161 ive already told you everything i know about that cant you see im busy
1253162 people liked the idea of having to work information out of people like npcs that would help further flesh out the story situation and what was going on
1253163 with rare exceptions the if ive attempted to wade through reads at best like the amateur stories submitted to critters org
1253164 we dont see many interesting pcs or npcs but thats more down to the fact most videogame writers have yet to achieve the basic competence of the average star wars novel author
1253165 the freedom and agency to do things that i know will provoke a strong emotional reaction
1253166 whereas plot is concerned with the literal unfolding of events story addresses the emotional progression of events throughout the narrative
1253167 the recounting of one or more real or fictitious events usually oriented around a single goal that are related to each other temporally and causally
1253168 this simple truth explains the utter failure of games to incorporate storytelling in any but the most mechanical and forced manner
1253169 the answer is almost universally an exploration of people their feelings and their relationships
1253170 interactive fiction is certainly interactive and its fictional in the sense of being made up but its certainly not storytelling the actual creations remain elaborate puzzles
1253171 crawford has strong opinions about what type of thing interactive storytelling is how it might be achieved and why most of the current efforts are sad failures they are sometimes aggravatingly unsubstantiated
1253172 games need to rely on both gameplay and storytelling not one preferentially
1253173 trippy light etc experiences become games when you tack on a lose condition
1253174 games continue to rely on impacts that are too simple shallow and trivial
1253175 so yes i would say that games are relevant perhaps not in quite the same way as a book or movie but then games are a unique form and need to be appraised from a new perspective
1253176 there is a significant association between hours of television watched and both the severity of obesity and the presence of hypertension in obese children
1253177 to say that obesity is caused by merely consuming too many calories is like saying that the only cause of the american revolution was the boston tea party
1253178 look you know if you really want to know the truth what wed love to make is fallout nobody is doing anything with it do you think you could go see if you could get it
1253179 ok scrap it throw everything away weve done and lets start over again
1253180 hey listen we have a new solution for doing this and we should do it and take this risk and do it this other way
1253181 i have all these other ideas to make it better
1253182 yeah its taking a little too long to get this one
1253183 i determine the fallout ness of any game in this universe
1253184 i have a fan who is a hardcore fallout fan and he says what he remembers most about fallout is x

1253187 basically the psp version was cancelled because of control issues

1253209 this is where we prefer to compete to win on the water rather than in court
1253210 there was a brief glimmer of hope last tuesday when soci t nautique de gen ve won the appeal reinstating the spanish yacht club as challenger of record and kicking off a multi challenger event that there might be a return to some normality and that the 33rd americas cup could get underway again with the teams that had signed up last year but that has been snatched away
1253211 the team is very proud of ed and the guys sailing on the alinghi x40 theyve picked up another school of sailing very quickly getting on to these multihulls and competing at a very high level just goes to show the class of sailors that ed and the crew are
1253212 we are thrilled these were definitely very different conditions than those that we have experienced before we were learning every race it was pretty hairy
1253213 it started out ok but as the tide turned and started to go against the wind the waves built quickly and then the wind built as well a lot of teams had a fair bit of trouble but the crew did really well and we were able to hang in there and get the points we needed
1253214 we like beating everybody when we can thats our goal to go out and try to win on the water again the big thing for us during this event and throughout the whole series is to learn and to try to get ready for a possible multihull match in the americas cup
1253215 interseroh und alba arbeiten in unterschiedlichen m rkten erg nzen sich aber ber die gesamte wertsch pfungskette zum nutzen beider unternehmen sehr gut
1253216 ziel ist es die marktposition von interseroh im europ ischen rahmen auszubauen und zu st rken im aktuellen konsolidierungsprozess wollen wir eine aktive rolle einnehmen
1253217 die idee der alba group fu t darauf dass zwei eigenst ndige und gleichberechtigte unternehmen am markt gemeinsam agieren wenn dies zu ihrem gegenseitigen nutzen ist
1253218 wir gehen davon aus dass wir in diesen prozess in vollem umfang mit eingebunden werden und sind gerne bereit unsere expertise und die expertise unserer berater einzubringen
1253219 es handelt sich mit weit ber 800 teilnehmer innen um die bisher gr te deutsche vortrags veranstaltung zum thema der vegetarischen ern hrung berhaupt und noch nie bekam in der vergangenheit die presse und ffentlichkeitsarbeit f r ein vegetarisches event in deutschland eine solche riesige medienresonanz
1253220 das durchweg positive medienecho zeigt uns vor allem auch vor dem hintergrund der klimadebatte dass wir mit unserer botschaft in der mitte der gesellschaft angekommen sind
1253221 wir stellen fest dass die investitionsbereitschaft sowohl der institutionellen wie der privaten bauherren unter den unsicherheiten an den kapitalm rkten leidet
1253222 wir haben diese entwicklung kommen sehen und durch ein kostenoptimierungsprogramm die zentralisierung des gesamten beschaffungswesens der gruppe und weitere massnahmen sprechend gegensteuer gegeben
1253223 alle eingeleiteten massnahmen sowie die aktuell gute auftragslage stimmen mich zuversichtlich dass wir im laufenden jahr der konsolidierung der afg vorbeh ltlich unvorhersehbarer ereignisse unsere umsatz und gewinnziele im jahresvergleich bertreffen k nnen
1253224 die verbreitung der spanischen wegschnecke bis nach skandinavien ist im grunde ein weiteres alarmierendes warnzeichen f r den galoppierenden klimawandel denn noch vor wenigen jahrzehnten h tte dieser mittelmeeranrainer unseren winter nicht berstanden jetzt verbreitet sich dieser sch dling ungebremst so wie anderswo rippenquallen und moskitos immer schneller nach norden wandern als quittung f r die hemmungslose klimaver nderung durch den menschen

1253230 the whole regions transport network must establish a dense atmosphere of secure transport and production
1253231 we cant rule out that this was the work of a few east turkestan supporters within the country who have links to external terrorist forces
1253232 east turkestan terrorist forces are the most direct and most real terror threat to the beijing olympic games
1253233 but we do know the crackdown in xinjiang especially ahead of the olympics has increased discontent among uighurs
1253234 the general mood is fear official intimidation a police state fear

1253258 the australian reinvigoration of the industry has not really been successful weve been trying to re mine old deposits
1253259 this industry is dependent on new discoveries and new mines coming on stream and at the moment its not happening
1253260 its very very tough in places like south africa and australia to bring costs down because youre fighting a losing battle given the maturity of the belt that youre mining
1253261 without wanting to just preach our story i think youve got to go to new jurisdictions
1253262 and thats challenging as well because youve got to find those jurisdictions that have geological potential and manageable political risk
1253263 and thats where we think china has been under recognised
1253264 if you speak to the majors they say that china is difficult and it is its bureaucratically complex but its geopolitically very stable
1253265 nonetheless with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1253266 indicators of household spending have continued to record subdued outcomes over recent months and credit expansion to both households and businesses has slowed significantly
1253267 surveys suggest a softening in business activity and there have also been some early signs of an easing in labour market conditions
1253268 at the same time high prices of oil and a range of other commodities have added to global inflationary risks
1253269 given the opposing forces at work considerable uncertainty has surrounded the outlook for demand and inflation
1253270 on balance however it is looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
1253271 looking further ahead inflation in both cpi and underlying terms is likely to decline over time given the outlook for demand provided wages growth remains moderate
1253272 our global distribution diversified earning streams and strong capital position continue to help us support customers in todays challenging market conditions
1253273 as the outlook for 2008 remains uncertain we remain alert to the risks but we also see opportunity ahead
1253274 hsbc in australia will continue to position itself in those sectors and businesses where we have a fundamental competitive advantage and where we expect sustainable long term growth

1253309 i can confirm that the portuguese police put it to gerry as a fact that madeleines dna had been found in the apartment and the vehicle when it is now clear that that was not the case and that the initial fss report had said the findings were inconclusive
1253310 you have to ask what the police were trying to achieve by over presenting evidence that they did not have and clearly could not claim to have

1253348 with all that was going on everybody was pretty pleased
1253349 some people who just normally come in to buy shoes took advantage of a lot of the clothing
1253350 thats a pretty substantial global company thats said were the best place for them to locate
1253351 theyre now becoming quite dependent on the u s marketplace
1253352 these new players are an extension of a well established trend and an important aspect of our economy
1253353 if his conviction stands the enron prosecutions were a success if it doesnt prosecutors will have a hard time convincing the public that they took the right approach
1253354 we tried as hard as we could to do a thoughtful and conscientious job in a very difficult case

1253359 i dont think that the fed can really pull any of its levers to create a short term fix
1253360 to go higher i think we need the sentiment to change with lower energy prices crude oil dropping below the 117 area certainly would provide a very visible benefit in terms of the economy but it also makes the problems seem a little bit less severe

1253363 we cant let that happen we have to take back what was ours to begin with
1253364 we apologize for the knee jerk reaction the affected stores are being directed to put the magazines back on sale

1253368 it was a shocking and brutal murder one can only imagine the pain and suffering her family has gone through
1253369 after seven years investigators have still been receiving new information about this crime which gives everyone renewed hope that the answers are out there
1253370 the coroner has covered all aspects of the investigation and made appropriate recommendations which we will take on board

1253396 las palabras de solbes no ayudan a conseguir un acuerdo suponen un nuevo rev s al estatut

1253399 reforzado la seguridad en todas las instalaciones y en la villa ol mpica
1253400 el efecto m s doloroso de la crisis por la que atraviesa la econom a espa ola es el crecimiento del paro
1253401 el mercado laboral tiene todav a un margen amplio para empeorar
1253402 una impresi n clara de la magnitud de la quiebra del empleo
1253403 que la industria y los servicios aguanten el tipo no evitar el empeoramiento grave en el mercado laboral al menos en lo que queda de 2008 y primavera de 2009
1253404 la actividad del ladrillo se aproxima a la recesi n
1253405 hay muchas probabilidades de que las proyecciones del gobierno se queden cortas
1253406 el impacto del paro va a ser intenso probablemente barrer las escasas posibilidades de equilibrio fiscal durante 2008 y 2009 y obliga desde ahora a pensar en medidas m s dr sticas de las que se han tomado hasta el momento para recuperar la demanda
1253407 no es por casualidad que la confianza del consumidor descendiera 5 4 puntos en julio respecto al mes anterior
1253408 la situaci n econ mica como corroboran los ltimos datos del cis es tan negativa como la respuesta del gobierno ante una situaci n que no admite trampas sem nticas
1253409 las cifras no admiten interpretaciones sesgadas porque los n meros no son m s que el reflejo de una dolencia cr nica de un mercado laboral anquilosado
1253410 se est destruyendo empleo a pasos agigantados pero no s lo es el paro sino el ipc la brusca ca da del crecimiento la dilapidaci n del super vit del estado o el d ficit por cuenta corriente
1253411 la situaci n es peor de la que preve amos todos ha sentenciado solbes
1253412 aportan su parte del retrato sobre los contornos de la crisis
1253413 hay que presionar a los que se quedan sin empleo para que no agoten el periodo de prestaci n y se preparen activamente para acceder a otro puesto
1253414 otro dato llamativo poco congruente en periodo estival es el anormal aumento del paro en el sector servicios durante julio
1253415 la explicaci n que se da desde hace a os sin que la administraci n act e en consecuencia est en las trampas consentidas a las empresarios que fingen cerrar en verano env an a sus empelados a cobrar el subsidio y reabren en septiembre
1253416 quiebra la tendencia de un mes propicio para las contrataciones temporales y ensombrece a n m s un panorama econ mico hu rfano de estad sticas que alivien la inquietud de la sociedad
1253417 tambi n es el indicador que mejor refleja la profundidad de la crisis
1253418 en el decepcionante contexto nacional la afirmaci n del vicepresidente solbes de que la aspiraci n de alcanzar el pleno empleo respond a m s a una ambici n del programa electoral del psoe que a una an lisis t cnico realista trasluce tanta frustraci n con impotencia
1253419 cinco activistas de eta han quedado libres por motivos de salud casi triviales y en absoluto graves
1253420 estas actuaciones judiciales que probablemente est n s lidamente sustentadas no s lo no amainan la inquietud social por las circunstancias del caso de juana sino que agravan la preocupaci n por lo que supone un trato ciertamente incomprensible hacia los miembros de una banda terrorista que ha causado tanto dolor y que amenaza la seguridad de los espa oles
1253421 la investigaci n para tratar de determinar si de juana incurri en enaltecimiento del terrorismo por el contenido de la carta que se ley en su nombre el pasado s bado en san sebasti n se enmarca en las facultades con que cuenta el estado de derecho para perseguir aquellas conductas que puedan coadyuvar a la violencia de eta y menospreciar a las v ctimas
1253422 es precisamente su nueva condici n de hombre libre la que le obliga a ce ir su actuaci n a los m rgenes previstos
1253423 el silencio del gobierno de ibarretxe ante la nueva controversia generada por la libertad de de juana resulta demasiado audible frente a la impune demostraci n de insensibilidad
1253424 aqu la nica presi n es la ley que hay que cumplir tanto cuando permite que se deje en libertad a un criminal irredento cuando avala que se le pueda devolver a prisi n por enaltecer el terrorismo
1253425 la ltima prueba del desmoronamiento absoluto de la versi n oficial del 11 m que cocinaron en comandita el ministerio p blico la polic a y la prensa progubernamental

1253427 la fiscal a ratifica ahora lo que ya dijo el supremo que no exist an v nculos entre al qaeda y la c lula del 11 m

1253430 zapatero acept hace dos a os una hipoteca cuya primera letra vence el 9 de agosto fecha tope fijada en el estatut para determinar la financiaci n de catalu a
1253431 la financiaci n auton mica viene a satisfacer las necesidad de unas comunidades obsesionadas con tener dinero para gastar
1253432 sin embargo son m s quienes creen que el estado administra mejor que los gobiernos auton micos y casi un 47 tiene claro que con el actual modelo descentralizado se pagan m s impuestos
1253433 ilustra los temores de pek n en v speras de la apertura de unos juegos ol mpicos muy pol ticamente cargados
1253434 la realidad es que pese a lo espectacular de la fachadas de la china de hu jintao ha incumplido sus promesas de que la adjudicaci n de los juegos redundar a en un avance de la causa de los derechos humanos
1253435 china que va a estar bajo la lupa desde el viernes s lo puede reclamar de los observadores objetividad y buena voluntad no que tengan los ojos cerrados a la realidad
1253436 s lo ha hecho falta un acontecimiento planetario como los juegos ol mpicos para que un pa s tradicionalmente aislado como china se haya visto sumido en un torbellino de violencia que no distingue entre oriente y occidente ni entre democracia y reg menes de partido nico
1253437 una consecuencia seria ser a que el r gimen tan habituado a la brutalidad con sus enemigos internos se pusiera a la altura de los criminales y eligiese m todos intolerables para combatirlos
1253438 un escaparate a escala mundial para lo bueno y para lo malo
1253439 las autoridades tienen el deber de procurar la seguridad sin convertir a todo el mundo en sospechoso los responsables de la seguridad de los juegos de barcelona demostraron que tal combinaci n es posible
1253440 el gobierno asume su responsabilidad y afronta la crisis que atraviesa el sector lo hace ayudando a reactivar su actividad a trav s de la vivienda protegida especialmente en alquiler y la rehabilitaci n y adem s sienta las bases de la pol tica de vivienda de los pr ximos a os para ello necesita suelo ste es el objetivo
1253441 el deterioro del empleo se agrava con el peor julio desde 1960
1253442 el desempleo crece con m s intensidad en aquellos territorios donde se dio un crecimiento econ mico acelerado vinculado a la construcci n

1253444 child sexual abuse which unfortunately on occasion involves parents relatives and teachers has become very common some of our children are abducted and forced to become soldiers or wives of those that abduct them
1253445 these have increased the vulnerability of our children traumatised them and left indelible scars on their minds
1253446 in the face of the many challenges that face our children and youth the church cannot stand aloof and watch but has to come out vigorously and protect the human rights of the young ones
1253447 these children need special shoes to help them in the healing process the shoes are mainly custom made and because of their effectiveness we were able to win
1253448 there are good values that can be borrowed from modernity but if we totally abandon our values we are heading for disaster let us restore our good values for a better rwanda
1253449 when a young person sees an old person stranded offer assistance
1253450 we have to show them their role towards security and stability a lot is expected from them towards attaining our nations vision 2020

1253452 they were killing me i had to tell them something
1253453 continue to pose the most dangerous threat to american lives
1253454 we are moving to a global village and yet we dont have our global elders the elders can be a group who have the trust of the world who can speak freely be fiercely independent and respond fast and flexibly in conflict situations
1253455 despite all the ghastliness that is around human beings are made for goodness the ones who ought to be held in high regard are not the ones who are militarily powerful nor even economically prosperous they are the ones who have a commitment to try and make the world a better place we the elders will endeavor to support those people and do our best for humanity
1253456 some rogue elements in the isi are working against the interest of the country they are being funded by a terror sponsor state the us
1253457 anytime the supreme court called the interior ministry or the defense ministry they could not get the isi into the court
1253458 a bad day for the resources sector was partially offset by a very good day in the banks
1253459 all commodities were down 3 or 4 per cent across the board last night oil fell us3 58 gold was down us8 90 an ounce and copper was down 4 per cent
1253460 mr rudd and mr swan between them over eight months have destroyed business and consumer confidence in the australian economy
1253461 they talked up inflation as being a crisis they delivered higher taxes in the budget and now weve seen petrol and grocery prices increase
1253462 that was always mr rudds plan to slow the economy
1253463 looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
1253464 with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1253465 thats an indication not only that there arent going to be any more increases in interest rates but raises the question of when do they cut
1253466 the statement does not give any clues as to when that might be
1253467 additional rises in market interest rates and tougher credit standards have delivered some additional tightening of financial conditions without them having to lift a finger
1253468 there could be one by christmas theyre going to wait for more data
1253469 theyve got an easing bias but theres no timing on that theyre not in a particular rush to change
1253470 they talk about uncertainty weighing on both inflation and growth
1253471 this is a fine organization and its an important organization its rallying businesses and non governmental organizations and faith based and community and civic organizations across our country to advance a noble cause ensuring that the united states leads the world in spreading hope and opportunity
1253472 according to the report in 2005 the united states gave 5 3 billion to the u n a 30 increase from 2004 funding level of 4 1 billion almost every department of the u s government plus several independent agencies fund the u n although the u n does not track this information or at least does not make such information public most experts say the total u n budget is between 15 20 billion the u s funded portion is between 25 and 30
1253473 by the end of next year america and other nations will set a long term global goal for reducing greenhouse gases
1253474 to help develop this goal the united states will convene a series of meetings of nations that produce most greenhouse gas emissions including nations with rapidly growing economies like india and china
1253475 the purpose of the foundation is to advance the mission of the food and drug administration to modernize medical veterinary food food ingredient and cosmetic product development accelerate innovation and enhance product safety the foundation shall take into consideration the critical path reports and priorities published by the food and drug administration identify unmet needs in the development manufacture and evaluation of the safety and effectiveness including post approval of devices including diagnostics biologics and drugs and the safety of food food ingredients and cosmetics
1253476 the bill s1082 does not address the outstanding critical problem that the office responsible for post market drug safety lacks the independence lacks the authority to promptly identify serious health risks and take necessary steps that will protect the public as i think we all agree the fda is in desperate need of major overhaul
1253477 let me be clear big pharma does not like these bills fda management does not like these bills lobbyists are spending hours upon hours lobbying against these bills what is wrong with establishing a separate center within the fda not outside the fda within the fda with its only job being that of a watchdog for those drugs already in the market what is wrong with supporting a clinical trial registry and results database that also requires sponsors to reveal their negative trials i propose there is nothing wrong with any of these proposals
1253478 we were told she was in shock we went to our local hospital wrexham maelor a e because we were concerned
1253479 we thought she was showing signs of someone who had had a stroke because she had a droopy mouth but we didnt realise a child could have a stroke
1253480 i found the stroke association on the internet and they have been absolutely brilliant with us but i dont feel that we should have been in that position where we have had to find that out for ourselves
1253481 its incredible we have seen such an improvement in such a short time
1253482 the child i came home with was not our daughter as far as i was concerned shed died in that hospital and they had sent us home with a stranger how she has pulled through i dont know
1253483 im optimistic now two weeks ago i never thought wed see what were seeing now she is just so strong
1253484 a care plan for daisy has been agreed pulling together the combined skills of a number of clinical disciplines to ensure that appropriate treatment and therapy are provided
1253485 we need to look at the future and the long term viability of all the remaining branches in this area especially those in carnglas road in swansea and leonard street in neath
1253486 i would therefore like to appeal to all customers and businesses to support their local branch and make it the first point of call for all business
1253487 they dont seem to have taken into consideration the areas geography and its transport infrastructure and the ability for elderly people and disabled people to get to an alternate branch
1253488 to get from neath abbey to skewen you have to go up a massive hill and they havent taken that into account also theres nowhere to park there if you do drive and it will cost more money for elderly people to get there to pick up their pension which is minimal
1253489 these might be small things to people in government but massive to people on the ground trying to make ends meet
1253490 i love museums and galleries they make us consider why the present is at it is and what the future might hold
1253491 we want to continue to enthuse our visitors offering the opportunity to learn through collection items be inspired and feel connected to the museums as iconic symbols of what wales is all about
1253492 the illumination of these two historically important structures will have a significant visual impact and highlight an interesting and important part of pontypridds past
1253493 our family is aware there is a lot of speculation and conjecture about her situation within the community
1253494 i do not wish to go any further into the circumstances leading up to or surrounding her hospital admission
1253495 to do so publicly at this point is not in paulas best interests
1253496 there has been speculation within the media that paulas hospitalisation is in some way related to comments by sam newman on
1253497 if we dont foster talent were condemning the state to a bleak future
1253498 ultimately it is about a fair outcome as opposed to a ludicrous bid
1253499 what their bid is about is 2 8 billion more over three years the whole education budget is 2 billion so it is totally unaffordable it is sort of magic pudding meets wizard of oz

1253553 there are things i wish id urged her to do things i wish i had said things i wish i hadnt said but i am not a racist i never made a racist comment and i didnt attack him personally
1253554 but what i do know is that this is not what i wanted my high school experience to be

1253562 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1253563 he says hell be ok and is looking forward to a full recovery
1253564 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1253565 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1253566 a super rich pal who was closely involved with the campaign finances is helping john
1253567 its likely this man doesnt know all the dirty details of johns extramarital affair but is acting out of loyalty and is not asking a lot of questions only writing the checks

1253578 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1253579 looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
1253580 with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1253581 thats an indication not only that there arent going to be any more increases in interest rates but raises the question of when do they cut
1253582 the statement does not give any clues as to when that might be
1253583 additional rises in market interest rates and tougher credit standards have delivered some additional tightening of financial conditions without them having to lift a finger
1253584 there could be one by christmas theyre going to wait for more data
1253585 theyve got an easing bias but theres no timing on that theyre not in a particular rush to change
1253586 they talk about uncertainty weighing on both inflation and growth
1253587 they did talk about inflation remaining high in the short term but on balance economic growth remains subdued
1253588 they talk about tight financial conditions further signs of a slowdown in domestic demand
1253589 it is a pretty clear sign that the next move is down
1253590 this statement is not as concerned about inflation they still expect inflation to be high in the short time
1253591 it is trying to judge how fast the economy is slowing
1253592 maybe it will take another one or two months to absolutely convince the board to get them across the line for a cut
1253593 we have been saying the end of this year or early next year
1253594 our global distribution diversified earning streams and strong capital position continue to help us support customers in todays challenging market conditions mr davis said
1253595 as the outlook for 2008 remains uncertain we remain alert to the risks but we also see opportunity ahead
1253596 a fundamental competitive advantage and where we expect sustainable long term growth
1253597 growth indicators including sales profits employment and investment all fell over during the last quarter which paints a very scary picture for australias 2 4 million small businesses
1253598 business expects the economy to grow by less this year under labors treasurer wayne swan than it did in the previous year under the coalition
1253599 it is a stinging truth that business has lost all faith in labor after only nine months in government
1253600 the australian economy has weathered many storms under the coalition including the asian financial crisis but it is evident small business doesnt think mr swan is capable of managing australias 1 1 trillion economy
1253601 labor is doing nothing to give business owners reassurance each time confidence hits a low labor succeeds in getting it even lower
1253602 at a time when australias gdp is relatively strong were seeing business confidence spiralling downwards under wall to wall labor governments
1253603 i want to thank god for making me 5 foot 3 and 114 pounds so all this could happen
1253604 valenzuela 73 was selected for induction by the hall of fames historical review committee for health reasons he couldnt travel from california for the ceremony but was awarded his plaque at a recent ceremony at santa anita park
1253605 we are certainly not pessimistic on protection margins going into the second half but we are unlikely to see a recovery back to the level we enjoyed in 2007
1253606 for the second half continued growth in the global production of steel foundry castings and solar panels should support a further strong improvement in the performance of the ceramics division benefiting from a full period contribution from foseco and from our continuing investment in capacity in higher growth higher margin areas
1253607 during the first half of 2008 we have continued to focus on delivering value for our shareholders by maintaining leading performances in trading and production whilst developing our biomass capability
1253608 both of our strategic carbon abatement projects to deliver efficiency improvements by upgrading our turbines and to grow our co firing capability have made good progress
1253609 lets take a holiday boil a second egg for breakfast fall in love

1253612 when we hear about islamist resistance lets try to put ourselves where they are and try to see it from their point of view
1253613 were no longer based on the existence of nation states we must reinvent ourselves
1253614 for atheists considered worthy of the death penalty by islamists to team up with their ultimate opponents in attacking canadian civic society demonstrates the fundamental bankruptcy of these two political ideologies
1253615 there are more people now saying they dont have answers
1253616 this is the new frontier how are people going to eat when theres global warming and when so few will be able to grow food
1253617 the issues of justice inequality and poverty are common themes we can work together on they are concerns of conscience
1253618 if the speaker wants to use some of the house operating money for the budget we should look at the other programs that were impacted by budget cuts as well
1253619 every day i go by and i still cant believe it
1253620 the focus is to have the bulk of everything completed by the start of the fall instructional league
1253621 thats the whole focus of the move and the complex to be a 12 month player development facility
1253622 we agreed to run 6 inch conduit all the way up the building build a room up there have an emergency generator and also let them have access to the side of the building to mount equipment
1253623 we want to improve the site we want to clear it off
1253624 we think it will be good for the look of the butte
1253625 he went in had a brief conversation and shot the clerk
1253626 based on the video it did not appear to be an argument
1253627 a lot of people who worked at that store were family members and were seeing how we can help them
1253628 so if theres a wait you can go shop until its time for your appointment
1253629 we couldnt get her into a doctors office in time
1253630 it gives them an opportunity to take control of their situation we will give them ample time to get their affairs in order and them go out on their own terms
1253631 its a joke i cant think of a single client and i have hundreds this will appeal to
1253632 it doesnt make any sense for anybody to come forward there are no guarantees and no safeguards
1253633 ive talked to many people who have gotten that 5 a
1253634 he was doing twice as many breathing treatments compared to the school he was at the last year
1253635 i dont think anyone anticipated that within months of them signing the plan it would be in effect
1253636 there were a lot of people waiting for the castle rock cut to be reopened
1253637 i saw the excitement building back in january and february when a lot of us figured this was the year as soon as it opened our visitation took a big jump
1253638 the chances of getting her in here are so slim
1253639 there is a possibility when she places that call that shes an actress
1253640 if every garage mechanic and driver knew the details and was involved in the planning of the attack it never would have happened
1253641 you must decide the weight and significance if any such statements deserve
1253642 it is attention that has significance for the war on terror
1253643 they are constantly jumping from one three month contract to another
1253644 the whole episode shows just how sick is our economic system where suing your employer has become the primary way to get a contract
1253645 so maybe something is going on on a wider scale at google
1253646 ask is naturally more difficult to game and no ask rep has needed to ask webmasters to rat on their colleagues because it hasnt needed to
1253647 their complete absense here on webmasters world their refusal to engage with webmasters plus the lack of referals does mean no one hearabouts gets excited about ask
1253648 in the last 10 years our monsoon has been kind of weak and this year weve had some good rains
1253649 we have smiles on our faces because we like having good moisture
1253650 this is just a fun way for me to say hey boys im still here
1253651 the people who bought the homes say well we love looking into your yard and seeing the horses and the cattle but we dont like the flies and we dont like the mosquitoes and when i cut my field to bale it they say we dont like the dust in the air
1253652 i respect that theyre here and spent a lot on their homes but on the other hand give me a little bit too ive been here since i was 7 years old
1253653 next week we expect natural 95 to lose another 20 to 30 hellers a litre
1253654 i can confirm that the portuguese police put it to gerry as a fact that madeleines dna had been found in the apartment and the vehicle when it is now clear that that was not the case and that the initial fss report had said the findings were inconclusive
1253655 you have to ask what the police were trying to achieve by over presenting evidence that they did not have and clearly could not claim to have
1253656 kate and gerrys lawyers are continuing to examine all of the information in minute detail and where anything that is relevant to finding madeleine needs to be done it will be
1253657 the owners take care of them with enthusiasm and love velorex will definitely not die
1253658 the main news of mondays statistics is that trade is doing better than was expected this means the economy will not probably slow down as considerably in the second quarter as many had thought
1253659 but concerns about these impacts and the risk of the rates further fast firming should be among the main reasons of a cut in interest rates the czech national bank could already come up with this week
1253660 early this year there were double digit growths the strong crown and weaker foreign demand will take their toll
1253661 the influence of the strong crown on exports should be more noticeable in the second half of the year
1253662 companies try to save where they can and postpone investment in new equipment but still a number of them export at a loss at the current exchange rate

1253666 shut up you retarded organ i can hear every word of that song and i can feel each beat on that drum stop creating a nuisance i know when to stop
1253667 kb shares have grown in recent days exactly the same as before the publication of q1 results which is a signal that the market expects good results to a certain extent
1253668 i am convinced that if the czech current government is to work there should be no duel in the party the congress must approve topolanek in the post
1253669 i will not run for the post of party leader as i bear in mind that a success would mean confrontation that would weaken the governments fragile stability
1253670 some deals were struck and no such developments seem to be in the offing in the ods
1253671 i can hardly imagine the ods and the government to survive if anyone but topolanek were elected as the party leader
1253672 we are defending 12 positions of regional governors ten would be a success the loss of one half of regional governors would be disastrous
1253673 topolanek has repeatedly said that if he does not manage to have the crucial reform legislation passed the government will lose legitimacy i agree with him
1253674 this may trigger dramatic twists and turns that might affect the congress still i do not think that any emergency scenarios will occur
1253675 we will refund 50 percent of the entire cost of the project to facilitate growth he added
1253676 i dried fruits and vegetables on the ground in the past so that it was very dirty and dusty after four days of drying
1253677 those who miss the operations in the gaza strip dont worry they will come
1253678 the president will raise a number of issues such as the permanent status issues checkpoints and prisoners
1253679 the most riveting ball busting adventure ive read in decades
1253680 a daily column will exhaust a man too rapidly if one could like domestic foul lay new eggs just like the old ones then production would be easy but when each new one must be more tasteful in shape and larger in size and richer in quality who can lay one egg every day
1253681 we are together we are loved and so it will be
1253682 god of many names known in the spoken word and most profoundly in unspoken silence we say with you and in you and through these simple words we reclaim our sanctuary
1253683 this sanctuary which has been defiled by violence we rededicate to peace this holy place which has been desecrated by an act of hatred we reconsecrate for love this sacred space which has seen death we recommit to life the holy spiritual home which has known fear we rededicate to faith and freedom

1253691 we have a ton of work to do and not a lot of time
1253692 the players have worked extremely hard for the past seven months so the foundation is in place but there is still much to learn
1253693 i have always been honest with them with saturdays praise and they proved they werent quite capable of handling that and i think it took the edge off them
1253694 i wasnt too happy with how he looked today even after the rest
1253695 it might take longer than expected thats unfortunate a lot of times though it is traced to how vigorously a player goes after his rehab and how diligent they are in the summertime my guess is he probably wasnt as diligent as necessary
1253696 of course the season is running out but i want to get back as soon as possible i will just keep working as hard as i can to get back
1253697 but there is no way to put a time table on his return were just trying to get him up and running again
1253698 i took a bad swing and i kind of hurt it
1253699 so here i am im up and walking around so thats good
1253700 i thought i was getting close i was looking at a rehab assignment when i got hurt again so from that regard its frustrating
1253701 i hope to go out there and give this team a chance to win every time
1253702 tell andy hell get his driver back when i get mine
1253703 what should damn well be evident by now is he is most emphatically
1253704 it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might and with all the strength that god can give us to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime that is our policy
1253705 no way im not going through with this you shouldnt have used so much flour

1253710 i know that people have been killed by lightning and to me the surest way to do that is to hang around when you have lightning striking all around you
1253711 i didnt really need any previous experience other than to know that when you have that kind of conditions it would behoove you to seek some kind of shelter and quickly
1253712 i was like what are we doing you could tell that it was coming and they say count the seconds between the flash and the thunder to determine how far the storm is
1253713 im not sure how accurate that is but you could certainly tell when a storm is imminent and when its approaching i felt like that was an inning that probably never needed to happen
1253714 people want to say the umpires should have done this
1253715 i know its money driven and tv driven but when it comes to the overall health of players and the fans and the sport in general i think you certainly need to review those policies and maybe do a better job of implementing some things in situation like tonight
1253716 n o acho que se trate de um compl terrorista
1253717 trata se de uma luta armada e a resposta persistente repress o do governo chin s na regi o
1253718 lamentamos o ocorrido e estamos muito preocupados pois vemos que a repress o das autoridades chinesas obrigou os uigures amantes da paz a adotar o caminho da luta armada contra as autoridades

1253734 lo importante es que en el deporte espa ol estamos viviendo en 2008 el mejor a o de la historia deportiva y cuando me preguntan en el coi por qu ganamos todo les respondo que por 3 factores
1253735 el primero de ellos el arranque de barcelona 92 el segundo el plan ado de becas que permiten a los atletas entrenarse sin la presi n del sacrificio econ mico y el tercero la profesionalizaci n de los dirigentes deportivos
1253736 tambi n que espa a cuenta como el mejor secretario de estado para el deporte en la persona de jaime lizzavetsky y que el presidente del comit ol mpico espa ol coe alejandro blanco se dedica d a y noche a la labor ol mpica

1253760 are you sure you want to do this please try again
1253761 i see it as a challenge just to win their coaches trust back
1253762 they brought me back for a reason it was definitely not as a backup to be honest with you i am not a backup nfl tackle i saw it as a challenge and if you are running away from competition then this is not the game for you i welcome the competition and i am going to keep striving to take this spot and keep it the rest of my time here
1253763 this is a system he has been in before and thrived in
1253764 so far so good but the next major step is coming in during the preseason games under the gun
1253765 i was just thinking too much not settling in and i did not have a lot of focus
1253766 there are a lot of things going on the field on sunday and i have to do a better job of being focused you have to play even when you are trying to figure out what you need to do on any given play you kind of forget about the snap count it is about being calm and hearing all the calls and knowing the ins and outs of the offense
1253767 i dont think you can throw your cards in and say i am going to be a backup
1253768 even if they brought in a first round center i am going to walk around here like i am the starter they are going to get rid of me sooner or later but for now they got to go through me that is how it goes he will have a job who knows if it will be here or not
1253769 no doubt this is a very good crop of young arms
1253770 the results have been pretty phenomenal and everybodys been as good as their numbers
1253771 he has an innate ability to match his four seamer fastball with his two seamer and a feel for knowing when to use each
1253772 you just dont see that very often from a youngster
1253773 we knew coming in he was better than a 10th round pick
1253774 he has kind of a slice and dice four seamer that goes 93 94 but what makes him effective is that he has very short arm action thats hard to pick up a guy watches him from the side and thinks hes nothing special but that changes when he gets to the plate
1253775 hes got a breaking ball that he hasnt used a lot but will begin to use more and he has thrown a sufficient amount of strikes to get the job done
1253776 its an area we have to work on as he goes up the minor league ladder
1253777 but hes got a real pitchers body and a good delivery
1253778 but would it be fair to put the economy into a deep recession or depression i dont think so
1253779 t he experience was a tragic testimonial to the importance of monetary forces
1253780 the drastic decline in the quantity of money during those years and the occurrence of a banking panic of unprecedented severity were not the inevitable consequences of other economic changes
1253781 throughout the contraction the system had ample powers to cut short the tragic process of monetary deflation and banking collapse had it used those powers effectively in late 1930 or even in early to mid 1931 such action would have eased the severity of the contraction and very likely would have brought it to an end at a much earlier date

1253783 to go back and watch some of the highlights was good for me
1253784 it gives you that confidence that one bad game isnt going to tear you down
1253785 look at the two games i had in games that we needed to win to get to the bowl game i went out and had the two best games of the year
1253786 to go back and watch your good plays from the year before really helps reassure yourself that bowl game was a fluke that was just a bad game and everybody has them you reassure yourself youre legit enough to go out and make plays in the big games
1253787 i think it was said once the ultimate measure of a man is how he stands at the moment of controversy
1253788 its easy to be up when youve thrown for 300 yards five touchdowns thats easy
1253789 its a lot tougher when you dont succeed and you have to stand there and face the critics thats a part of growing up i think he handled it very well he took responsibility thats a part of being a leader
1253790 i feel like i can be a coach on the field thats what i strive for ive had a year in the system a year with these coaches a year playing in big ten games
1253791 i know the offense like the back of my hand i dont have to think about it i can just see the defense and react thats something ive really noticed during off season workouts before im looking to try to recognize the coverage and right now i see the safeties and i dont even have to think i know where im going with the ball thats something that comes along with the experience im a lot more confident a lot more comfortable going into this season
1253792 a lot of it is going to come down on him
1253793 hes the head of our offense everything we do is going to be based off of what he does
1253794 but honestly i have to go back to the offensive line he can only do so much with the protection he has if hoyer can get just a few seconds he can pick a defense apart
1253795 we got a taste of a winning season and it only made us hungrier to go out and take the next step this year
1253796 to become that upper echelon big ten team weve got to close out games its huge for me thats where ive got to make my next step as a quarterback making the big time play in the clutch
1253797 hes been dealing with this shoulder problem for a long time
1253798 going in to repair the problem is his best chance now to open up next year feeling 100 percent
1253799 im a single parent and for 2 worth of earthworms its a total no brainer for me
1253800 jake right now would be the front runner theres no question about it but hes got to earn the job hes got to play the position better than he did a year ago
1253801 well let the guys compete and well see what happens
1253802 its been pretty well documented that i didnt play as well as i should have last year
1253803 it was a learning experience and its going to make me that much better
1253804 ive been so crazy lately i dont think anyone understands the magnitude until they actually see whats going on for players they come in and ok its all there its like a game day for them like everything suddenly appears and it happens
1253805 just like anything else transition is tough youre going to have your ups and downs and we just said weve got to take it one day at a time some things are arriving a few days later than usual but i understand the urgency of it all having been an equipment manager with michigan football transitioning with the coaching staff it made it a little bit tougher and not being able to get this going until aug 1 when everything in terms of practice starts has been tough
1253806 its like starting a whole football team over again and then you have new staff members and coaches
1253807 its been hard because at least before you had stock now we have all this adidas stock and not that much time to work with really though things have been smooth
1253808 the jerseys are fantastic theyre shinier i like them with the sheen on them
1253809 i laugh when i read that stuff because that was all approved by all of us last fall
1253810 we didnt plan on a coaching overhaul so there were a lot of sizes this staff wears that the other staff didnt wear and thats taken out some of the extra stock we thought wed have in certain sizes
1253811 im at every practice making sure with the players how the product is
1253812 theyre my eyes im out there but until i get feedback from them because i dont know if somethings hurting them or if there are any types of problems with someone on site it makes it easier to tackle that problem here
1253813 the players had good enthusiasm and they worked extremely hard
1253814 i asked them raise your hand if youre in the best shape of your athletic careers and i think they all raised their hands
1253815 all of our team is in better shape they got through the first practice which was pretty intense they got through it very well the key for us is to continue to do that were not in game shape but were in better shape than we were in the spring
1253816 its more intense more like every practice is like game day
1253817 its all about business no joking around but were going to have fun its more amped up than it used to be
1253818 it was hard it was harder than what we did under coach lloyd carr it was just faster no breaks we couldnt take our helmets off couldnt take a knee
1253819 but hes practicing and hes done enough to earn his status back on the team but he has not done enough yet to warrant playing time theres going to be some playing suspension but thats yet to be determined
1253820 we knew you guys were filming that was just playing around
1253821 hes certainly going to be a weapon for us on offense
1253822 if it gets the fans excited we already sold our tickets i think sometimes if youre not used to that and you get your teams ranked high it sells some tickets rah rah
1253823 hardeman will knock em out and he can run better
1253824 and travon is a big strong guy a corner thats playing safety there will be a learning process for donsay kevin and justin were great players but the reason i dont have as big a concern about that as i do with running back and middle linebacker is that weve got some pretty good players stepping in
1253825 my focus this year is just staying consistent i want to take the next step forward if i start a game slow i want to be able to get back on track as quickly as possible until last year in all my years here we had never won a bowl game now we did that and that gives us all sorts of positive vibes and momentum heading into camp
1253826 ive seen eagle scouts come to college and flunk out and not just athletes
1253827 weve all heard the stories he was such a good young man you cant predict how someones going to react in a college environment recruiting is an inexact science its hit or miss weve hit on some weve missed on some
1253828 theyre going to start out even and compete from that point
1253829 kellen knows that he certainly understands everything ben has really made great improvements he had a really good spring
1253830 i really didnt feel like it was a bad inning per se
1253831 he didnt throw strikes but theyre hard to lay off and ive seen veterans do the same thing
1253832 i think glaus did a good job with the fastball that was a mistake and then these guys did a good job of putting the bat on the ball
1253833 with the bases loaded and those two guys coming up i felt confident i was going to get out of it
1253834 golf was once described as a long walk punctuated by disappointments
1253835 find comfort in the god who gathers up the past into the future
1253836 the person who does these things will live by them
1253837 do not say in your heart who will ascend into heaven
1253838 the word is near you on your lips and in your heart
1253839 no one who believes in him will be put to shame
1253840 everyone who calls on the name of the lord shall be saved
1253841 it is because of my righteousness that the lord has brought me in to occupy this land

1253844 weve always said that u s residents are a tease for us because theyre right next door but we dont get the kinds of numbers wed like to get from there
1253845 this kind of attention from usa today is so valuable to us this will be seen all over the united states we could not afford to buy that much advertising space in usa today considering what they would probably charge for it
1253846 you cannot buy advertising like that the photo gallery would be seen all over the world for people who dont understand what the p e i tourism product is this article with its image gallery gives them a really good snapshot
1253847 in the process of developing that we were approached by foss maritime company which is the largest harbour tug operator in the united states about two years ago
1253848 lots of harbours are clamping down and saying that tug operators have to reduce emissions and theres not very many options as far as doing that this is one of the only ones really
1253849 its good for the environment its good for p e i its applying new technology advancing the engineering field its a green idea and the world needs that right now
1253850 when i was in singapore delivering a paper at a conference there were all sorts of companies around the world that were interested in looking at this
1253851 were recording about 94 millimetres and its still coming said a spokesperson at the charlottetown airport monday at 3 p
1253852 that translates into about two inches which is a high norm
1253853 its still coming down as we speak so im guessing at about three inches for our area said robert macdonald who farms in belle river
1253854 we always welcome rain and i heard some of the growers up west were really glad to see it
1253855 it was great timing said john wallace a potato grower in elmsdale
1253856 we got better than two inches and it was dry up until then its been dry from bloomfield corner on up for some time now
1253857 theres no indication of any crop damage at this point i think for most regions this water is likely most welcome
1253858 it will certainly delay the haying but the vegetable crops just love the water he said in an interview
1253859 the first goal is to raise as much money as we can for the childrens wish foundation the second goal is to meet as many people on prince edward island as possible
1253860 its our namesake city and province so we added an extra day from wood islands to west royalty sobeys so we could touch more people in the province
1253861 we dont get to come to p e i too often so when we do come here we try to make as big an impact as possible and we really want to get out and see everybody on the island and were hoping that everybody can come out and see us
1253862 the more money we can provide for the foundation means the more wishes they can grant for children that need them the most to put the smile back on their faces
1253863 the endurance level is something some people dont realize i mean to run for the next five days and to be pounding on the pavement and also doing the community work that you will be doing we certainly appreciate the effort you put in
1253864 for the last year or so weve identified the attraction of an nhl camp as a legitimate tool to create economic and tourism development in a traditional time when the industry can use a boost
1253865 we were very lucky to have florida and columbus come to summerside for a few days
1253866 our goal is to get a whole camp a whole 10 days that creates an opportunity to do a number of activities and events that a few days dont allow you to do so we embarked last year to find out if the market would fit here and the first step was to bring the blue and white game in with the islanders
1253867 that allows us to continue the relationship with the national hockey league with the ultimate goal of attracting a training camp
1253868 were hoping and we continue to negotiate with the american hockey league and were hoping that a very positive announcement can come in the near future that were going to have the american hockey league come to summerside
1253869 the fourth and final step and it doesnt mean we cant get the fourth step if we dont get the third step would be to actually get an nhl team and weve identified an original six thats something thats steeped in history
1253870 the team we attract would have two home games here whether they were in summerside or somewhere else thats yet to be determined
1253871 you have a rookie game the rookies of this nhl team would compete against rookies of another nhl team and with boston going to halifax this year and with the new york islanders in moncton it makes some sense to get in this circuit
1253872 you dont even have to ask the question this time
1253873 i aint guaranteeing nothing but weve got a good chance of going over there and bringing the gold medal back

1253906 the proposed legislation will not only hinder free speech by korean netizens but seems to be aimed at controlling the public opinion of internet news media

1253943 there was a lot of pressure i felt the pressure myself being a young guy
1253944 our message was just to keep the ball up and if we be aggressive with the ball in hand it would keep them out of the game
1253945 i think our ball carriers whenever we went into contact we drove them that extra metre just to get them out of the game
1253946 the boys really wanted a lot of aggression out there
1253947 there is a fine line between aggression and anger and anger is when you do stupid stuff that was the message throughout the week
1253948 the coaches drove home that our attitude wasnt up to par the week before
1253949 so for us to get the upper hand in this game we had to start off well and set our intentions straight from the get go i think the boys started off well and it lead off into the rest of the game
1253950 it will give us a lot of confidence leading into the african game
1253951 as a group we have had a lot of pressure over the last couple of weeks this win means a lot to us
1253952 heading over to africa is not going to be easy but it is good for us as a group just to have some confidence in what we can do heading over there
1253953 the tactics the coaches thought well about what we were going to take into the game and the boys wanted to execute that well
1253954 it came off quite well a lot of it came down to the boys attitude and what we wanted to do
1253955 you can have the best game plan in the world

1253980 you will never know love unless you surrender to it
1253981 the hardest thing is loving someone and having the courage to let them love you back
1253982 i dont wanna need you coz i cant have you

1253987 the fear is that conditions among financial firms are far worse than is commonly understood
1253988 there was a widespread perception that the second half of the year would show improvement now investors are starting to doubt that
1253989 we are not seeing data that would be consistent with recessionary conditions
1253990 the market is dealing with anxiety about further losses and also coming to grips that were in a significantly slower period of economic growth
1253991 whats the matter carla you look like the bottom just dropped out of the car
1253992 we walked through the door without knocking children were in the front yard playing hide and seek and creating a ruckus the house was like a train station people everywhere running from place to place some carrying food others children all in their own world the almost ephemeral smell of mexican food everywhere your mama and i had only been together four months but i knew she was the one id brought her to see granny and grandad many times my father loved her but my mother seemed pretty uneasy dont worry your mama said it was the first time id met her family theyll love you she said your mama was all smiles she pulled me from person to person hardly any time to say hello and laughed with childish delight at every astonished expression the kitchen was packed with large hipped women bustling about fussing over food they were celebrating auntie consuelas birthday and your grandmama had been cooking tamales with your mama and aunties for two days so thered be enough for everyone chicken tamales with green chilies for great grandpapa uncle tomah and cousin luisa pork with red chilies for your aunts elaina nina and consuela hot hot chili tamales with chicken and olives for inez your mama and sweet pineapple raisin tamales for all the little ones it took pounds and pounds of mesa to make them and your grandmamas fingers were stained yellow when i shook her hand for the first time which was soft but not smooth and looked into her big black eyes i knew your mama would always be beautiful youve got their eyes you know
1253993 there were so many people carla i could not remember their names
1253994 yes uncle carlos in his prime when i met him he had a full head of hair down down to here
1253995 your cousin tammy was your age back then and louder than everyone you could hear her across the room
1253996 this is mia and margot paul and enrique marta rita and isabella but we call her isabeau
1253997 your mother was very suave she pulled me through the crowd like a little red wagon with a brand new toy in it and that was me
1253998 oh my darling child but i was there were two long tables in the back yard one for food one for the adults and a little tiny table for the kiddies and the cars took up the whole block even some of the neighbors were there but i didnt have to remember their names everyone was gathered around the tables getting beans or quesadillas or fajitas or burritos enchiladas and rice and chimichangas but most of all tamales only your mama makes them as good as your grandmamma i piled my plate with a chimichanga rice guacamole my favorite
1253999 grandpapas green chili and chicken inez your mama and i sat at the head of the table with consuela grandmamma grandpapa and great grandpapa there were toasts and jokes and then grandpapa stood up tapping his brandy glass with his fork all night long he had avoided my gaze when your mama introduced me he scowled and his lips disappeared under his mustache mmh hmm mmh hmm he said and stroked his chin
1254000 love my darling the only look papas care about well that and sex

1254297 the government must issue an unequivocal message that it is ending the culture of impunity by putting its act together and by addressing the attacks on media
1254298 get the perpetrators even more important get the masterminds and ensure their swift prosecution and punishment stop the killings and assaults set an example by halting any attempt to try to stifle the media
1254299 the attacks on media practitioners only prove the failure of the government to fulfill its paramount obligation to protect its citizens
1254300 presently the qcpd continues to monitor study and draw assessment from previously identified carnapping activities and possible root causes as references to current developments
1254301 some carnapping suspects who were arrested by qcpd in the past have posted bail and are back in the nefarious business of carnapping under concealed identities and or merely forming another syndicated carnapping group
1254302 i hope that the arroyo government learns from this experience by exercising more transparency and circumspection
1254303 it should start by opening the grp milf agreement to full scrutiny by the supreme court congress the local government units and people of mindanao and other concerned sectors
1254304 im in favor of pursuing the peace process in mindanao but the entire country deserves more time to study the legal constitutional and socio economic implications of this particular agreement
1254305 we have initialed the text of the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain last july 27 2008 the pact is a done deal it is binding on the contracting parties who are obliged to refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of their agreement
1254306 done with a credible third party witness the malaysian government as facilitator of the talks since 2001
1254307 the act of initialing the moa ad agreed text between the parties constitutes a signature of the philippine government and milf
1254308 the milf leadership which is the central committee of the milf has an official position on that vis a vis the tro issued by the supreme court and the position o the milf the official position is that the memorandum of agreement on the bangsamoro ancestral domain has been signed
1254309 our position is that after initialing both parties initialed the moa that is a signing
1254310 this is not even a setback to the milf we are on the upper hand especially in the battle for moral ascendancy
1254311 it is the arroyo administration which is shamed in the eyes of the international community there are so many ambassadors already in the malaysian capital to attend the signing ceremony only to be told that it is canceled at the last minute
1254312 we hebben ons gebaseerd op de bedragen in het buitenland
1254313 na overleg met de profliga zijn we overgegaan tot de verhoging van de vergoeding
1254314 per maand zijn dit al flinke bedragen we kunnen de refs nu nog moeilijk amateurs noemen onze beoordelingen zullen dan ook behoorlijk wat strenger worden
1254315 zowel qua fysiek techniek en prestaties kunnen we nu meer van de scheidsrechters verlangen dat recht hebben we nu
1254316 tom boonen verdient ook meer geld dan johan vansummeren en in europa worden de matchen uit de champions league ook beter vergoed dan die in de intertoto
1254317 het is ook een extra motivatie voor de refs beter presteren betekent interessantere matchen n meer geld
1254318 de opslagvan de refs die niet internationaal fluiten is trouwens ook niet slecht
1254319 ook voor deze bedragen hebben we naar het buitenland gekeken daarnaast heb ik me gebaseerd op de gemiddelde loonsverhoging van de refs
1254320 er zullen nog wel fouten gemaakt worden maar we kunnen de refs stilaan profs noemen zo zullen de spelers automatisch meer respect tonen
1254321 een goede scheidsrechter is het minste wat we kunnen vragen
1254322 we willen dat de refs beter gaan presteren maar we moeten ook ons zegje kunnen doen de evaluatie mag niet enkel in de scheidsrechterscommissie gebeuren
1254323 onze vertegenwoordiger zal onafhankelijk zijn en we zullen zeker volwassen blijven
1254324 voorts is het logisch dat de refs opslag krijgen ze zijn sleutelfiguren maar waren te lang amateurs
1254325 de profliga heeft een grote inspanning geleverd de clubs zien het nut in van een goede professionele arbitrage en zullen de lat nu hoger leggen dat mag ook na een foutje zal er nu snel geroepen worden dat we er ondanks onze loonsverhoging nog niets van bakken maar ik kan dat wel hebben met vier clubs die degraderen krijgen we straks de moeilijkste competitie in 10 jaar

1254327 home owners with mortgages are not looking at what the rba does but what banks decide to do
1254328 we all know banks will take their time to pass on any cuts just like the servos with petrol if anything they will probably wait till the second half of next year to pass on any cuts its profit gouging profit making is no longer good enough
1254329 i think customers will be absolutely filthy if the banks do not pass on within a reasonable time any official cash rate reductions he said

1254340 any thrift store in town is going to have a huge selection of glass and plastic jars

1254348 gas prices went up and i upped my rates people have to understand that at 4 a gallon i cant run 15 miles to pick you up and drive at 2 an hour
1254349 our basic philosophy is to let the free market set prices
1254350 you can charge whatever you can get away with but i dont think you should have to charge an arm and a leg to make a living
1254351 a little bit before they gave tips now nothing if the price goes up you lose tips people get mad
1254352 you can get that increase but if you dont have people in the cabs it doesnt matter well just have to wait and see
1254353 i sometimes take cabs whenever i plan on drinking i havent taken one in a while honestly
1254354 im good for it im just happy to be out
1254355 i think its because some people have let go of that second car he said

1254359 overall it doesnt really matter if you run the car its going to take gas

1254361 you might try to weed out that call if youre gonna hop skip and jump all over town you only have yourself to blame for the high cost
1254362 its wasting our resources come out on fourth avenue where you gonna sit you drive around or you just go home
1254363 there aint nothing youre going to get out of there except a good nap

1254396 i am disappointed with the answer he gave he just tried to beat around the bush
1254397 democratic party dp is a good natured party but as prof musa musana said in 1980 dp egumire is strong like a tomato of course i know there is upc where i grew up from the problem with most of our opposition parties is their lack of focus you should learn to differentiate between political parties and political grumblers political parties come up with their own ideas while political grumblers comment on other parties ideas
1254398 amama is telling us they cannot leave power for young ones because they went to fight for money not freedom if they had gone to fight for freedom they should appreciate the voices of ugandans and step aside for young guns

1254408 livestock keepers are moving around not because they like that kind of life it is because the places lack services like water dams veterinary services greener pastures and even markets

1254410 this ministry is very important to our economy but little is allocated to its activities it appears there is no comprehensive plan to help livestock keepers get the necessary services and support
1254411 this is not accidental the government has not planned for changes our fishing sector will grow only if the government will be serious about it

1254420 i dont think he loses focus but definitely this has been a bit of a trend at times where hell be lights out and then all of a sudden just kind of hit a wall
1254421 ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
1254422 i told her with a little luck she could be the only lady to serve as first lady and miss buffalo chip
1254423 when im president im not going to let them take vacation
1254424 we need a commander in chief who will end the war in iraq but will end it the right way by winning it
1254425 i want us to come home with victory and honor so we will never go back again
1254426 dont let nov 4 find you on the open road
1254427 interferes with the issue which is who should be elected in november
1254428 there are things that i wish id urged her to do there are things i wished i said things i wished i hadnt said but i am not a racist i never made a racist comment and i didnt attack him personally
1254429 i never was mad at senator obama i think everybodys got a right to run for president who qualifies under the constitution and id be the last person to begrudge anybody their ambition
1254430 senator mccain and his republican allies just cant help themselves given the choice between offering real solutions or engaging in more negative attacks they choose the low road every time
1254431 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1254432 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1254433 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1254434 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1254435 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1254436 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1254437 acts of violence and intimidation such as these are unacceptable and they continue a troubling pattern seen at ucla and other uc campuses that should be repugnant to us all
1254438 these acts threaten not only our academic researchers and their families but the safety and security of neighbors in our communities as well
1254439 we as a community are unambiguous in our condemnation of these actions let me be clear this is not protest this is terrorism
1254440 prior to that the vast majority of actions taken were against institutions break into the lab steal the animals trash the facility
1254441 more recently however theyve become much more personal attacking the researchers at their homes california seems to be the focus of this activity right now but not the only focus
1254442 i think its a form of domestic terrorism intended to intimidate people
1254443 these are incidents that could have killed someone they are obviously intended to prevent researchers from pursuing the advancement of knowledge they are a serious attack on academic freedom
1254444 preach this we respect all living things and then they do that with children in the house
1254445 the inconvenience and the suffering of any children or any family members pales in comparison to the suffering and oppression that goes on in these animal laboratories
1254446 putting himself and his family in harms way by continuing to abuse animals
1254447 for rational people this violence is not the way you exercise your opinions in a democratic society
1254448 we support our colleagues in the sciences and the academic freedom that goes along with being a professor
1254449 they told her that the best thing she could do for al qaeda was to start popping out little jihadists
1254450 she was furious she knows more about this stuff than pretty much anyone in the organization
1254451 in the area where she was sequestered they put their weapons down while trying to talk to her and she seized a weapon and began to shoot
1254452 our officer returned fire she was shot in the stomach but continued to struggle
1254453 we thought she was dead until her brother in houston got a visit from the fbi the other day and said she is alive
1254454 i dont think it is fair to a guy who is 75 yesterdays 75 is not the 75 of the 1950s if you stop screening and treating men at 75 you are going to have a lot more people dying of prostate cancer
1254455 the problem is that we cant tell which ones are really bad
1254456 come on over baby all i want is you christina aguilera
1254457 like in all distressed industries there is a cycle much like in the casino and energy companies of seven or eight years ago
1254458 the filing became necessary because of the recent failed effort to obtain financing and the recognition that the companys entire 1 8 billion of debt may soon be in default
1254459 the continuation of the debtors core business the design construction and sale of homes and residences and the sale of other property is critical to their efforts to reorganize
1254460 the debtors reputation in the marketplace will be damaged such that the debtors will be unable to generate sufficient funds
1254461 parents have to navigate a minefield of calories fat and salt to find them
1254462 parents want to feed their children healthy meals but americas chain restaurants are setting parents up to fail
1254463 mcdonalds burger king kfc and other chains are conditioning kids to expect burgers fried chicken pizza french fries macaroni and cheese and soda in various combinations at almost every lunch and dinner
1254464 proud to offer a variety of kids meals for those looking for lower calorie lower fat options
1254465 it is important to remember that torn calluses are an injury whenever you have an injury you must give it time to heal altering your training to focus on lower body exercises is the preferred course of action however sometimes competition and personal factors makes it necessary for athletes to train or compete with an injured hand what are you going to do to protect your hands and keep from aggravating the injury wear gloves no way
1254466 teaching becomes secondary and discipline is the main thing that goes on i dont feel like im making a difference anymore
1254467 they were brokering relationships with complete strangers to fool the credit scoring system that this was a genuine relationship
1254468 that is a very bad thing not to have a credit score
1254469 you heard sounds of violence from next door mr jacobs
1254470 i did sergeant just after i moved in groaning thumping she sounded distraught
1254471 that nagging bitch next door mrs eslake husband killed her hes bad tempered and huge with it
1254472 her ex husband her name is still mrs jacobs she survived and identified you
1254473 the question from the consumer is what do you accept from the brand and what feels foreign
1254474 consumers have looked to us as a resource for music for quite a while
1254475 this time there does not appear to be that next wave of tenants ready to absorb the space
1254476 there is virtually none these spaces are likely to remain dark at least five years or longer
1254477 its too soon to say whats going to happen with those spaces
1254478 its like a ghost town this will make it a worse situation for all the other retailers that operate in the mall if a retailer was on the fence about re signing a lease this could be the nail in the coffin the mall concept has not proved its workable
1254479 i cant think of one retailer who would in todays economic climate even with free rent in owings mills mall its a sad sign of the times and there is more to come
1254480 here lately the malls been pretty dead i dont know if its vacation or the economy and people dont want to spend their money
1254481 i think boscovs closing will hurt sales but i dont know how much with sears macys and penneys still here
1254482 and its already challenged by weak demographics to the north in glen burnie where shoppers arent going to support high end shopping
1254483 theyre such a large company that the loss of three boscovs will not do much to them at all
1254484 the mall itself competes with the department stores and now the mall is sort of serving the function of what the old department store used to be
1254485 ge ti imiz sezon zapotocnyyi 2 milyon euroya be ikta a teklif etmi tik almad lar sezon bitince fiyat 4 5 milyon euro oldu
1254486 udinese bonservis bedeli olarak 2 milyon euroda direniyordu be ikta ise en son 1 milyon 750 bin euroya kadar kt ancak fazlas n vermedi yle olmay nca da h rvat oyunculara y neldiler
1254487 are not slavs but have a direct descent from the ancient macedonians
1254488 demographic evidence is at best tenuous at worst non existent
1254489 the reason why greeks did not show a close relatedness with all the other mediterraneans analyzed was their genetic relationship with sub saharan ethnic groups now residing in ethiopia sudan and west africa burkina faso
1254490 confounded the elegant analysis of the historic basis of the people of the mediterranean basin with a political viewpoint representing only one side of a complex political and historical issue
1254491 we would have had mass resignations and the journal would have been destroyed if this paper were allowed to remain
1254492 using results from the analysis of a single marker particularly one likely to have undergone selection for the purpose of reconstructing genealogies is unreliable and unacceptable practice in population genetics
1254493 anomalous results which contradict history geography anthropology and all prior population genetic studies of these groups
1254494 tracing european founder lineages in the near eastern mtdna pool
1254495 clinal patterns of human y chromosomal diversity in continental italy and greece are dominated by drift and founder effects
1254496 origin diffusion and differentiation of y chromosome haplogroups e and j inferences on the neolithization of europe and later migratory events in the mediterranean area
1254497 were going to battle so hard for that second olympic gold its worth any sacrifice
1254498 there are thousands of examples to show that being favourite doesnt matter on the pitch
1254499 the team that wins is the one that deserves it and is best on the day not the one with the most tradition or a name theres only one way to win with the ball
1254500 there was no way that we could have ever anticipated these tough economic times
1254501 so many people were affected with their mortgages and high gas and food prices this is beyond what anybody expected
1254502 it takes time to develop a customer base in new markets as customers come to understand who and what we are
1254503 the stores had not turned a profit given the economic situation we dont have the cash flow to keep supporting markets that arent profitable
1254504 were going to see 7 500 to 8 000 stores close this year
1254505 sent shock waves to every corner of the media landscape
1254506 the person who actually presses the button to make the recording supplies the necessary element of volition not the person who manufactures maintains or if distinct from the operator owns the machine
1254507 cablevision more closely resembles a store proprietor who charges customers to use a photocopier on his premises and it seems incorrect to say without more that such a proprietor makes any copies when his machines are actually operated by his customers
1254508 in my life i have never been afraid of anything
1254509 look youre telling us all the same stuff marion told us when we met with her and youre saying all the right things
1254510 it all makes sense but it all made sense when marion said it too
1254511 in contrast to those who have bobbed and weaved and used every excuse not to be an open book you had a startling offer
1254512 but i asked for this and i want to prove that im clean so for me its worth it
1254513 its a really unfair environment for truly clean athletes to have to live in
1254514 so weve got to come up with a model that allows us to further support clean athletes and do what we can do to try to take away that presumption of guilt that unfortunately exists out there today
1254515 projected a model that would restore faith but when usada announced details of the program it scratched the name without an explanation
1254516 whether its dara or any other athlete in this program we cant guarantee their cleanliness
1254517 these guys act like theyre interested in cleaning it up
1254518 i said what do you mean the codes are gone
1254519 for some reason at the end of the games they wanted to get everybody out fast
1254520 unfortunately we rely on an inadequate doping system and doping agencies for the proof
1254521 we live in a society where its innocent until proven guilty the key word being proven and we dont have any way of proving these people are cheating we never did
1254522 i think he ended up being pleased that someone was taking him seriously
1254523 most of the establishment was writing him off as some sort of crank or blowhard
1254524 he said he had a lot of documents that would be helpful but he wasnt sure if under the remaining three to four months of his parole hed be doing something that might violate any of those conditions
1254525 they asked me whether i thought it was worth pursuing and i said i thought it was
1254526 does that mean there will be no doping at the games probably not but it does mean that the limitations on somebody escaping detections are reduced markedly
1254527 dopers are taking smaller doses and quit well in time to the tested competition maintaining the benefits for awhile with blood transfusions
1254528 and thats a story that really ought to get flushed out because it makes you think oh my god how could they do that
1254529 this was a good country and nice people and here were all these kids one doping right under your nose not only that but they were measuring their hemoglobin five or six times a day with a little handheld machine they had all kinds of ways to do it if their hemoglobin got too high they took a bottle of saline and lowered it if it got too low they squirted in some red cells
1254530 its essentially a baby step or a necessary step to help evolve the science and to most benefiting clean athletes
1254531 when i see a four story multi hundred square foot building in beijing packed with chinese ready to do doping control good grief i never imagined we could get that far
1254532 i think the rest of the world probably now looks at the u
1254533 you look at the way the country has positioned itself and is positioned by the rest of the world i think the united states has been a leader in the world economy and so on and sport around the world looks to the united states
1254534 what i didnt know is how thoroughly organized and rotten these people were
1254535 not only did they have chemists but they had labs helping them they had doctors a whole consortium of people all of whom were trying to beat my test and find ways to dope athletes and they did
1254536 weve made so many steps forward we have things we never had before but how many new drugs are there out there that we dont know about
1254537 as a scientist i can do nothing but applaud because this is what they should be doing
1254538 they should have started it 15 years ago when i started talking about it
1254539 ok well they missed the boat but at least theyre doing it and ok maybe im not getting credit but i dont have to have credit im glad to see somebodys finally doing what i think ought to be done
1254540 so who knows that your tests go a lot further than theirs
1254541 people that know you that like you that are on your side for them nothing changes but for people who are evil and suspicious you can do whatever you want to you will not change their mind
1254542 but now today i would say i was wrong because she did change peoples minds
1254543 i have no idea about the background of these people
1254544 so when you tell me that theyre involved with drugs or whatever its totally news to me
1254545 now from what youre telling me they may have tried to get into working with some people like that starting small with protein shakes and later finding different ways or whatever but it never came to that
1254546 simply because i didnt like what they were doing and i thought it was useless since then i havent seen them at all
1254547 she doesnt even know these people so the connection between dara and what these guys are doing is totally absurd
1254548 just focusing back on what i need to do as far as going out there and having a really good year thats why i just want to put the rest of the stuff out of my mind for right now just really concentrate on football and let the business side take care of the business side
1254549 i just wanted to be able to come in with a clear mind
1254550 it was something that i hoped could be a possibility like i said i let them worry about the rest of it and i am just focusing on my end of it i have to hold my end up
1254551 chris brings a style to our offense where he can not only block but he can run and catch the football
1254552 one thing he has worked on over the years is his route running being crisper in his routs having a higher tempo really gotten better at that become a complete tight end i am looking forward to him getting in the swing of things to see what he can help us with
1254553 they are all intelligent guys and they are all guys that can do different things
1254554 nothings been done since ive been drafted with the giants
1254555 theres no question about that it should be over with after the next 30 day jail term all this comes from a juvenile offense
1254556 both of them were the reasons that kept this thing going since i was 15
1254557 i just had to serve those 30 days you know just because i made that mistake
1254558 it just kept going on with the situations i had in college that just kept it going
1254559 no nothing about that like i said it just kept getting pushed back because of the offenses in college
1254560 you learn from your mistakes and you get punished for them i did what i had to do just to get through this
1254561 just to come out here and try to make a name for myself and just play my role i think everything happens for a reason
1254562 we are honored to have been chosen for this prestigious award particularly as it comes on the heels of our launch of global sources online 2
1254563 with our online trade show and print media we believe that we offer the most complete platform for buyers to source from asia from discovery to final orders
1254564 we still need to push very hard in the development of the car and the reliability but even in a worse case like this were still in the championship completely
1254565 were still in the fight and well be pushing very hard over the break im in a very strong position in terms of me so i think im still growing a lot and learning race to race and that can help for the championship

1254570 those standards are fairly tough to meet but in many respects the beijing area does so
1254571 im sure im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1254572 we will evaluate those and should problems arise we may have to take some action
1254573 exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media
1254574 to come to a city even though the air quality might be inferior the long term effects should no longer be feared by temporary visitors
1254575 watching a stressful sports game involving the national team can more than double the risk of an acute cardiovascular event and the uaes poor cardiovascular record means spectators here can be even more at risk
1254576 sports enthusiasts who prefer watching the proceedings from the sofa rather than engaging in physical activity themselves should be aware that statistically the comfort of their living room is no safer than actually competing
1254577 all i know is that this 2008 team we push each other
1254578 we all want that hardware all we think about is gold medals thats what we dream about the way i see it we should bring a pile home
1254579 i expect them to win at least three gold medals at these games
1254580 they are better now they are coming here as world champions these guys are motivated and they will do really well
1254581 one of the reasons i took them to colorado springs is because last time we had a great team some of the best boxers in the world but every time they went home they boxed in a style that had nothing to do with the olympics
1254582 the bars and the floor are my two strongest events so im going to concentrate on them my main aim is to help the team qualify for the team final

1254590 scapular stability on the side you are flying it also builds core strength and balance to stabilize the kite in strong wind
1254591 constant upward gaze might aggravate neck problems for some people
1254592 stand with your back to the wind and hold your kite up as high as you can make sure the nose is pointing straight up and then gently let it go if the breeze is strong enough the kite will start to rise slowly let out a little flying line and the kite will fly back then before it reaches the ground tighten your grip on the line and the kite will start to rise again repeat this until the kite gets up into steady winds
1254593 look for a kite 5 to 7 feet wide and made of durable lightweight materials expect to spend 20 to 30
1254594 it works the quads hamstrings and calves for pushing off hamstring and calf eccentrically when landing and the up and down motion is good stimulus for the vestibular system which helps with balance

1254596 in 10 years from now it is not going to be so amazing
1254597 a 21 year old is not necessarily as good as a 35 year old
1254598 its all about making the right choices in training and knowing when to pull back there is really no reason why you cant be in the best shape of your lives in your 30s 40s and 50s
1254599 the fact that i can still do this stuff is a little mind boggling to me
1254600 if you make it work you are not going to do it for the rest of your life
1254601 when i run in marathons i dont run as fast as i can because i know i will probably injure myself

1254614 it is disturbing to neiman marcus to find out that our customers are not being taken care of

1254616 i dont know how safe you feel with a panic button that doesnt work
1254617 i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the fathers from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families their fortune on both sides is splendid they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune is this to be endured but it must not shall not be if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up
1254618 in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere he is a gentleman i am a gentlemans daughter so far we are equal
1254619 what the song shows is that rather than feeling embittered towards heather paul just feels sorry for her he feels sorry that she was never able to tell him the full truth about her past life he feels that their romance happened so fast and so publicly that a lot never really got said

1254622 we are very satisfied that after the successful deployment of astra 5a at 31 5 degrees east we have already been able to contract six transponders at this new orbital position the demand from customers for astra 5a shows how dynamic the market in central and eastern europe currently is
1254623 we expect that this new orbital position serving these markets will further develop rapidly the broadband services from satgate will certainly represent a sound base to develop an attractive neighbourhood for additional customers on astra 5a not only for broadband but also in combination with direct to home tv services
1254624 we are pleased to take our relationship with ses to a new stage based on its competencies and the high quality of service we trust the agreement for the use of four transponders on astra 5a will enable us to successfully expand our offers into the promising markets in eastern and central europe and the middle east we are looking forward to further develop our business and build on our strong relationship with ses
1254625 the mcc is an integral part of our customer service and support operations
1254626 our satellite mission experts at the center monitor the health of a spacecraft from the time it is mated to the launch vehicle through in orbit testing over the past 26 years more than 120 missions have been operated at boeing mccs and we continue to invest in this service so that we are prepared to support any customer commercial civil or government
1254627 this was the most difficult milestone in development of the falcon 9 launch vehicle and it also constitutes a significant achievement in us space vehicle development not since the final flight of the saturn 1b rocket in 1975 has a rocket had the ability to lose any engine or motor and still successfully complete its mission
1254628 much like a commercial airliner our multi engine design has the potential to provide significantly higher reliability than single engine competitors
1254629 we made a major advancement from the previous five engine test by adding four new merlin engines at once
1254630 all phases of integration went smoothly and we were elated to see all nine engines working perfectly in concert

1254633 we are committed to following a rigorous scientific process while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1254634 initial meca analyses suggested earth like soil further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry

1254637 you just made the whole thing up in your head
1254638 until one is committed there is hesitancy the chance to draw back concerning all acts of initiative and creation there is one elementary truth the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans that the moment one definitely commits oneself then providence moves too all sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred a whole stream of events issues from the decision raising in ones favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamed would have come his way whatever you can do or dream you can do begin it boldness has genius power and magic in it begin it now

1254658 another one of telstras obstructive tactics has been blown out of the water
1254659 management should now abide by the decision of the independent umpire and end the stalling tactics telstra hr needs to come back to the bargaining table and put the mou to a vote of telstra employees
1254660 if they wont come back to the table you have to question what are managements real motives
1254661 the challenge is now there for telstra to show it is genuinely committed to good faith bargaining
1254662 the future pay and conditions of more than 30 000 workers are at stake here its time for telstra hr to end the charade drop its hostile approach and sit down with unions
1254663 literally weeks after management mounted a blitz to sign 15 000 employees onto awas many of these telstra workers will now receive a nasty surprise they have been dudded out of some of their take home pay following changes to the way superannuation contributions are calculated
1254664 very few workers would have been aware they were signing up to an awa salary arrangement that was deliberately structured to avoid passing on improvements in superannuation
1254665 unions calculate that for a typical call centre worker on a total remuneration package of about 50 000 with 20 of their pay performance based their take home pay will fall by 720 a year or up to 3600 over the five year life of the awa
1254666 the telstra awas also give employees less certainty about important conditions such as sick leave hours of work and redundancy
1254667 this is a clear example of how telstra workers can be worse off on an individual contract compared to the collective agreement ea that unions are seeking to negotiate with the company
1254668 telstra management should stop treating its staff unethically and restart constructive talks with unions over transition arrangements for staff on awas and a new collective agreement to cover the telcos 32 000 staff

1254679 last season was embarrassing for us and it wasnt nice last year was a failure we didnt perform well and we finished right down the bottom of the table this year we have to improve and get back up the table where we should be going off last years finish it is not something to be proud of finishing down there hurts it hurt me and the rest of the lads they feel that as much as i do last year we had to turn it around and eventually we put a run together it will be another tough year because every club is improving everyone is throwing money at it and getting better buying better players we have to keep up with that if you stand still you can go backwards
1254680 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift its not just a new face we need its new faces my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the premier league season its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle im hoping we will have some in before the start of the season but im not going to turn around and say i am totally confident because you never know what happens

1254684 paul ince faces a battle to win over a significant number of his players who are not impressed by the way he has tried to impose his personality on the club
1254685 some players have been less than enthusiastic about inces approach to training which is said to vary drastically from hughess meticulous scientific method while others have complained that the former manchester united midfielder is too egotistical
1254686 cristiano ronaldo will undergo arguably the most gruelling examination of his career in manchester this week while manchester uniteds medical team assess the state of the portugal internationals right ankle sir alex ferguson will look him in the eye and test his resolve attitude and motivation the answers may determine whether it is the beginning of the end of the tortuous real madrid transfer saga or of ronaldos time at old trafford ram n calder n the madrid president yesterday undermined his argument that ronaldo represented all or nothing for his club in the transfer market this summer when the spanish champions sealed a 10 3m deal for rafael van der vaart
1254687 sunsport understands uniteds owners are considering giving the real madrid target a contract get out clause but they will first have to sway boss alex ferguson who is dead against selling the portugal winger boss fergie has categorically refused to sell ronaldo who has made it clear he wants a move and there is no certainty the scot will accept a compromise
1254688 experts on sub continent affairs have greeted the announcement with a pinch of salt and refused to rule out a bid from ambani who is worth some 21 billion city analysts believe that tentative third party contact has been made between sports retail magnet ashley and ambani and that the telecommunications tycoon has backed off due to the publicity caused by weekend reports it is also understood ambani is unhappy about revelations on sunday that his son attends a private school in kent due to security concerns and has made a tactical retreat
1254689 on the verge of agreeing a 6 8 million fee to sign vedran corluka which would take their spending on players this summer to more than 50 million the croatia defender was used at right back by manchester city last season but tottenham believe that he can replace ledley king in the long term as a central defensive partner for jonathan woodgate tottenham who were unable to complete deals to sign fernando meira or fabricio coloccini have been looking at more than one centre back because of fitness concerns about king and the erratic form of michael dawson last season
1254690 arsenal also linked with unsettled liverpool midfielder xabi alonso along with barry have been tracking the progress of de la red who has just returned from an impressive loan spell at getafe prompting madrid who would be unable to deploy him regularly in their first team to try to cash in on the talents
1254691 the worry within soho square is that such events will exhaust england players like wayne rooney steven gerrard and ashley cole and may impact on the third round of the fa cup the premier league hitherto the main obstacle to a january breather now want such a break but intend using it as an opportunity to expand their brand overseas in a series of mini tournaments instead of introducing the 39th game it does not make any sense to capello or the fa to have england players dragged off to asia africa australia or north america during a supposed rest period
1254692 in order to make it financially viable tickets for the game were priced at stamford bridge style prices of 40 100 thats like charging english fans roughly 1300 for a glorified friendly so ignore the bollocks about speading the word of the epl these games are about making money and thats making money at the expense of the host nations own leagues at the expense of the quality of the premier league at the expense of the england players who will have played extra games and flown extra miles ahead of international tournaments and at the expense of championship clubs who see even more money going into top flight coffers to further increase that gap
1254693 bill kenwright is prepared to vacate goodison park if he can find wealthy investors who can turn the team into title contenders
1254694 kenwright does not have the funds to help the club to break into the top four russian american and dutch investors have expressed an interest in buying the club and kenwright has turned to one of his friends sir philip green the billionaire retail entrepreneur who is the seventh richest man in britain for advice
1254695 in fernando torres and robbie keane liverpool have a strike force capable of bagging at least 40 goals between them enough to rival anything from chelsea manchester united or arsenal liverpool have always had a strong defence and with the likes of steven gerrard in midfield they are already a test for anyone but if keane and torres get things right and click straight away then it could be their year for glory
1254696 the area where arsenal are lightest is defence the starting four are fine bacary sagna is the best right back in the league and ga l clichy is on a par with patrice evra but the differential between them and their deputies is huge cover for kolo toure and gallas is equally threadbare fielding djourou or philippe senderos might suffice at home to hull but against one of the big boys theyd be a gap waiting to be exploited again its difficult to envisage arsenal emerging from a full season ahead of chelsea in particular
1254697 the parameters within which a club like villa operates in the premier league remain extremely narrow last seasons sixth place finish might be as good as its likely to get for a relatively small squad playing in a mid size stadium with a relatively parsimonious billionaire owner net spending over two years 35 5m fifth this year is a possibility fourth would be a step up into a different universe and anything lower an anti climax against that its not immediately obvious in which areas villa are likely to improve significantly from last time out it could be a difficult third season in charge for oneill
1254698 playing in the hole behind the central striker he sparkled throughout with his sure touch and weaving runs it was little surprise to learn that his role model is ronaldinho the ac milan and brazil striker not only because of his spell binding trickery but also because of the way he has kept himself grounded amid all the adulation with robbie keane having left for liverpool dos santos could play a key role for ramos this season
1254699 with the football league starting on saturday just what has been the best bit of business during the summer
1254700 a couple of veterans worth keeping an eye on are striker andy cole and midfielder lee carsley cole has moved to his home town club of nottingham forest and the 36 year old wants his final season as a player to end in promotion a big ask carsley has joined birmingham on a free transfer from everton he was a regular last season and i think he could prove to be a brilliant signing the fact he has been made captain in the absence of damien johnson hints at the impact he has already had
1254701 i have always judged managers not solely by successes but by the generosity of spirit and courtesy they reveal brian clough had few superiors but wantonly kept us waiting for ages in draughty corridors before making his waspish entry sir alf ramsey demonstrated his own complexes by once ignoring our arranged interview he had seen us coming up the drive before he moved hurriedly to the hotel dining room and despite that seemingly avuncular image bob stokoe was no longer a favourite after his dismissive two word threat when i had chased across a car park in a rainstorm in search of a required quote
1254702 it will be fascinating to see how he fares in his new surroundings the 22 year old has a wonderful left foot and new rovers coach paul ince has been singing his praises but villanueva is slight of build and not blessed with extreme pace south americans coming to england invariably confess themselves initially bewildered by the speed of the game and the amount of physical contact permitted this will be especially true in the case of a player coming straight in from chile so in addition to the cultural adaptation to lancashire life villanueva will have to modify the way that he plays
1254703 has paul ince lost the dressing room after seven weeks in the job
1254704 brings a whole host of different ingredients to the table
1254705 we are hard pressed to imagine a better candidate than dr jha
1254706 we have been discussing this project with isro since the last four months however the formalities will be completed by the end of this month when we will go to bangalore and sign the agreements
1254707 isro has provided us the money required to initiate the project the rest will be given once mou is signed
1254708 the development of this satellite in the year of our organisations golden jubilee will be of great pleasure
1254709 when i was composing the music for the award ceremony i was thinking what makes a champion
1254710 a man drove 110 miles in 330 minutes what was his average speed per hour
1254711 jam your right elbow in his crotch same hand on his chest push use your other hand to buckle him in
1254712 i am confident that the air quality will not pose major problems to athletes and visitors here
1254713 it is hourly data and we will evaluate those and should problems arise we may take some action
1254714 those standards are fairly tough to meet but in many respects the beijing area does
1254715 the misty air is not a feature of pollution but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1254716 give it a try you will love it dont follow rules make them
1254717 if he pietersen doesnt score runs at the moment england are well and truly out of just about any competition they need him doing that
1254718 when two captains are resigning and saying i need to just get back to playing cricket and worrying about scoring runs theres too much pressure captaining its probably not the most positive way to step into it
1254719 everyone has their different techniques and he inspires those around him just by his performance and his belief
1254720 theres going to be a lot of pressure on him now i must admit i wouldve let kevin keep being the number one batsman but who do you give it to in that group
1254721 there are a lot of young players and its a bit of a bombshell
1254722 hes very much like warne hell be very aggressive and hell be looking to always take control and be in command of everything that he is doing
1254723 hes that sort of strong personality theres no doubt about that
1254724 the worst part is over and i have had a lot of difficulties to overcome since the beginning but right now i am very happy with the progress i am making
1254725 that is thanks to the help i have had and i am just waiting for the moment when i am ready to play again
1254726 yes it can be difficult at times because i have never been through something like this before
1254727 i am still trying to get my focus back but the worst part is done with
1254728 that was the initial injury and the early rehabilitation i will try to come back as fast as i can and make sure i can play well when i do
1254729 i hope that i will know exactly how long it will take me to be back in training with my team mates
1254730 i want to find out as well when they think i can play again my hope is that it will be before christmas
1254731 the arsenal fans supported me a lot and the fact i was in brazil wasnt a problem because there is still a fan club there
1254732 fans from the club came to visit me when i was working out on my treatment all that kind of thing helps me a lot not only the arsenal fans but also the people that know me like my family and friends have helped
1254733 the boss has called me because he wanted to know how everything was going in brazil and i told him how i was feeling and the sort of training i was doing
1254734 i told him about the fitness and rehabilitation work i was doing that made him very happy
1254735 every day i dream about when i get back on to the football pitch but i am in no rush i am still finishing some parts of my treatment that will be done here at arsenal
1254736 i havent had a chance to speak to craig myself i was made aware of it after the game as i was in the players tunnel
1254737 an official from ipswich made me aware something had happened
1254738 we take such allegations seriously i havent spoken to anyone to find out what was allegedly said
1254739 i respect michaels decision to have a few weeks off
1254740 i believe he is still a fantastic batter one of the best batters weve got in this country
1254741 michael says he wants to score runs for yorkshire and hell go back into county cricket without any stresses or strains and hell score as many runs as he can and im sure michael will be back in this england team
1254742 they are huge boots ive got to try and fill but ill give it the best possible i can give it
1254743 ill always respect the job michael has done and the jobs my predecessors have done and i will always look for advice i am fresh into this captaincy and ill need some advice and help along the way
1254744 i spoke to michael at great lengths and one of the most exciting things is that ive had text messages and phone calls from the senior players in the squad
1254745 they basically said were right behind you and well support you once youve got the support from the lads around you who youre with all the time theres nothing more you can ask for
1254746 we did discuss his batting but it was a short discussion because we know what his capabilities are
1254747 when i was younger i used to watch the track and field a lot but for me seeing agassi win gold was awesome
1254748 its an honour and a privilege to get this opportunity and hopefully i can replicate what he did when he won his gold medal
1254749 to get the opportunity to take part in such a huge competition is fantastic im really looking forward to it
1254750 im feeling good all the worlds top players are going to be there but on my current form theres no reason why i cant challenge for a medal
1254751 its a big sacrifice but to be involved in the olympics is a rare opportunity very few athletes can say they have done it in their career and i think im playing enough to do well
1254752 its going to be tough for everyone after this tournament in cincinnati but you just have to give yourself the best schedule and try and do your best
1254753 this was going to be my last four piece competition but ive got to do whats best for the team
1254754 im fully fit for the bars and the floor which are my two strongest events my main aim is to help the team qualify for the team final
1254755 we finished sixth at the world championships last year so were an outside chance for getting a medal
1254756 kevin has got to play the way he wants to play look at his stats he is better than anyone in the side so why would you change let him go and do his thing
1254757 he is a fine player he has got confidence by the bucketload and he will probably take that into his captaincy the one thing we dont want is for him to change
1254758 he goes out to bat and will bat left handed switch shots and all those things but he doesnt just think about it on the spot you watch him practice in the nets
1254759 for the 2006 ashes series in australia he worked so hard at dealing with the short ball he works so hard on his fitness as well quite a lot of thought goes into the way he plays
1254760 he averages 50 odd with the bat in both forms of the game and he is an unbelievable talent
1254761 everyone will ask will his batting be affected but knowing kevin he will probably average 70 as captain
1254762 i enjoyed playing under michael he got the best out of his team he got the best out of me when he took over from nasser hussain there was a definite mood shift even in the week he took over
1254763 michael is relaxed and wanted people to express themselves and have fun playing and i think we did that for a long time it is sad that he has gone
1254764 it is massive boots to fill but i am sure kevin will be confident he can he is very single minded and talented i am sure he will be relishing it now
1254765 in the next round its different because you can say youve got the uefa cup but that doesnt make it any better if you dont get there
1254766 its like everything else youve just got to win your games and make sure you do enough to get through
1254767 we didnt do enough in the first leg we werent bright enough and weve got to be in the second leg we know what we have to do and i dont think you can approach the game with any great fear
1254768 we can approach it with confidence because if we play well enough we know we can go through
1254769 it gets to you just after the season finishes when you realise youre going to have to face the qualifiers before youre really up and running and thats the worst part of it but it happens and youve just got to get on with it and you have to be ready for it
1254770 our players have had a realisation of what they have had to do in games but as i keep saying to you last seasons part of it doesnt count
1254771 the knowledge that they gained and the confidence they gained from playing last year can have an effect plus if we start to play at the same level as we did last year
1254772 well have to do that to get through this game well have to play at a really good level to get through and thats up to us to ensure we do that
1254773 i dont know whether thats as good as kaunas can play i just know that we can play better than we did in that game and thats what well have to do concentrate on our own performance and thats what well do
1254774 never mind whats happened before it is an awkward place to come and play theyre in their season were not
1254775 i think its just an advantage to anybody whos played a tournament of that intensity going into the pga because the golf course changes when the heat of battle comes on and youve got a bit of adrenaline
1254776 certainly the last ryder cup there there are definitely shots some of the par threes changed significantly
1254777 theyre not forced to play it right from the tips but they probably will do
1254778 i think theyll probably set it up equally as tough
1254779 i think its a good golf course i think itll be very very demanding
1254780 i love that golf course i think its a great golf course they have made some changes caseys coach peter kostis went over there and played it and gave me a rundown
1254781 obviously some tees have been lengthened and some bunkers have been repositioned and ill have a look at that when i get there early in the week
1254782 but its a good golf course ive got good memories around it
1254783 the one weve spoken about signing was darron gibson who scored the second goal but he said that he wanted to do pre season at united and i couldnt wait any longer
1254784 theyve got a lot of really good young players but i cant see me doing any business there before the window shuts now
1254785 i obviously didnt nag my old man for players when i first started because i wanted to make my own name
1254786 with all due respect to league two i couldnt see any united players coming to us when we were down there
1254787 they tend to only go out to championship sides but maybe in league one i can get a few in
1254788 it was a lot more relaxed taking on my dad than last season we both enjoyed it
1254789 it was good of him to bring such a good squad down here because theyve got a lot of games coming up
1254790 it made it a good night for my players and for the fans
1254791 peterborough were the better side in the first half and should have been 2 0 up
1254792 but there were some plus points for us as well rafael da silva played the full 90 minutes and was pleasing and his brother fabio played 45 minutes as well
1254793 i was really pleased with their contributions and it will be interesting to see how they get on this season
1254794 the idea of twenty20 cricket at the olympics is definitely worth pursuing
1254795 if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
1254796 i had the time of my life at those games
1254797 winning the silver medal was one of the highlights of my career
1254798 twenty20 is going through a honeymoon phase at the moment
1254799 but in the next few years i believe it will become a worldwide phenomenon
1254800 should cricket make it to the olympics it would be significant especially to our country where the game is most loved
1254801 it will help the players to be part of a worldwide movement cricket is an exciting sport and should definitely be part of the olympics
1254802 it would be a great feeling for cricketers to be part of the olympics and the icc should take the initiative
1254803 the twenty20 format of the game is an exciting prospect and i dont see any reason why it should not be included in the olympics
1254804 even though playing for the country at various international events is a thrill to represent the nation at the olympics would be a great honour
1254805 our strategic objective was to obtain ioc recognition for the benefit of our members
1254806 i think im the type of person that if you say you cant do this and you make it harder it kind of makes me more determined anyway
1254807 aside from anything that happened four years ago it seems like its just been one nightmare after another and when each one comes its like a punch in the stomach but fighting it as well gives me energy a little bit as well
1254808 thats why i said it gives me a boost to come this far and confidence that things are going to go well
1254809 you think about it as any other race and in any race that i go into the aim is to go in and win the race the conditions and the weather are going to make it open
1254810 normally in my preparations i can tempo run over certain courses and compare them and say im in similar shape to london 2005 london 2002 chicago something like that
1254811 i cant do that this year because everything has had to be modified and everything has had to be really dictated by what my leg could take doing and progressing it gradually from there
1254812 everything has been on adapted treadmills ive done a little bit of running outside but the volume of training is more than normal because some of it has been cross training we have super saturated it with that to put the endurance base there
1254813 you take it in your stride because its a means to an end
1254814 the hardest thing for me is running outside is what i enjoy doing and being stuck inside on different gym equipment might mean that youre sweating a lot more and youre helping with the adaptation more but its not the same enjoyment
1254815 at the same time i do think that is a plus side mentally coming into the race as well because you need a lot of toughness
1254816 i was bitten by a spider three weeks ago and ended up being rushed into emergency i couldnt walk on my foot for two days
1254817 the wasps captaincy is probably one of the biggest challenges of my career so far
1254818 this season coming is pretty special for wasps as the guinness premiership champions we will want to keep hold of our silverware and pick up even more honours
1254819 we have a fantastic squad filled with lots of young and exciting talent and i am very proud to lead this group of players
1254820 2008 09 will also be a very special year for our international players competing for places for the lions tour of south africa which is a goal many of my team mates can reach
1254821 my priority will be to make sure everyone delivers for the club first
1254822 i want us to keep winning and as the captain it is my job to ensure we stay focused
1254823 when wasps rugby director ian mcgeechan spoke to me about the captaincy my first thought went to lawrence dallaglio
1254824 hes a great leader and an absolute legend of this game nobody will ever replace him ever and for me it has been a great honour to play both alongside him at wasps and against him in the international arena
1254825 it is with his support that i take this role he is a great friend and he will continue to be even though he will no longer be at the club
1254826 what raf has achieved his character and the way he operates is first class and there is no more deserving a man for the job
1254827 with the departure of lawrence dallaglio there are of course some big boots to fill

1254840 our great business in life is not to see what lies dimly at a distance but to do what lies clearly at hand
1254841 facing it always facing it thats the way to get through face it
1254842 a positive thinker does not refuse to recognize the negative he refuses to dwell on it positive thinking is a form of thought which habitually looks for the best results from the worst conditions
1254843 life affords no higher pleasure than that of surmounting difficulties passing from one step of success to another forming new wishes and seeing them gratified
1254844 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness

1254846 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1254847 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1254848 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1254849 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1254850 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1254851 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1254852 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1254853 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1254854 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1254855 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1254856 if i am not enough for you then end it now so i can stop draining myself and stop hurting and start healing and becoming who i once was
1254857 i am going to end it with you make you uproot and move out lead you on and continue to fuck you all the while
1254858 i i for some reason unbeknownced to me i let everything slide
1254859 there i was looking for the truth and i was suffering
1254860 while searching for the truth i suffered and while suffering i prayed to god for enlightenment

1254868 or madam truly your forgiveness i implore but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door that i scarce was sure i heard you
1254869 art sure no craven ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore tell me what the lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore
1254870 other friends have flown before on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before
1254871 thy god hath lent thee by these angels he hath sent thee respite respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore quaff o quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore
1254872 thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted on this home by horror haunted tell me truly i implore is there is there balm in gilead tell me tell me i implore

1254879 if it were not for hurricane dolly the size of the dead zone would have been substantially larger
1254880 i expect that pulse to be making its way out in a few weeks it could extend this years hypoxic zone or dead zone further into the summer maybe even in september
1254881 this is a brutal environment to be trying to raise money on wall street or through private equity firms
1254882 the initial onslaught of permit applications had the appearance of a major league gold rush that in retrospect doesnt seem to be playing out
1254883 i believe he will be best remembered for his portrayal of ennis del mar in brokeback mountain and his delivery of the plaintive line i wish i could quit you
1254884 no one in his or her right frame of mind would have said these things given this the best option would be for the teacher to be assigned to a desk job and not be allowed to be near youngsters anymore

1254917 there is a major problem with parents perception of their childrens weight as all children are getting bigger it is becoming more difficult for parents to work out whether their children are overweight by just looking at them and comparing them to other kids
1254918 the only way we can work out whether children are getting bigger is to weigh them all and the only way we can ensure that something is done about it is by making sure everyone concerned knows about their measurements
1254919 to him ops i feel sorry for bringing into trouble over my previous entry
1254920 we have decided to be happy because it is good for our health

1254924 the path to a new financial market architecture however uneven and improvised will not only be marked by the forces of retrenchment the path should equally be distinguished by the creative impulses that drive product and market innovation it is perhaps too convenient to denigrate the attributes of ingenuity when the forces of innovation can disappoint and weaken the real economy policymakers and market participants alike should recognize that innovation in our product markets labor markets and yes our financial markets is likely to prove a necessary net contributor to economic growth in the coming period we should also be reminded that financial innovation need not be equated with product complexity
1254925 newly issued covered bonds backed by high quality mortgage loans and issued by strong financial institutions may find a growing investor base in the united states
1254926 imagine that guarantee securitized bonds to make them desirable and they the investors will come in droves

1254942 its obvious that opposing counsel is dicking us around and im over it
1254943 the laboratory acknowledges that its environmental stewardship in the past was very different from what it is today during the last decade brookhaven has made great strides in cleaning up the environment and keeping it clean and we work hard to be a good neighbor
1254944 you get less house and property for the same price but were willing to make that sacrifice to save on gas prices and commuting costs
1254945 there is a whole confluence of government policies tax spending regulatory and administrative that have subsidized sprawl
1254946 when people bought homes they punched the numbers and said can we afford the mortgage payment and taxes
1254947 this new paradigm is going to have families being more deliberate about the cost of transportation spending and energy costs thats a new phenomenon in the united states that will be the change that will change development patterns
1254948 we have to move to a new transit oriented development paradigm and concentrate development and avoid the sprawl that weve allowed in the past and undo some of the environmental damage
1254949 what were pluses of that lifestyle are now liabilities a big suv a big home to heat the energy needed to mow the lawn
1254950 and were only at the shallow end of the pool
1254951 longer term rising fuel prices produces a positive effect people living closer in and in smaller homes and close to transit
1254952 if government does something against the market it is going to fail
1254953 it is fatuous to believe that because fuel costs 4 a gallon today that we will all decide to live in apartment houses
1254954 the economic reality is that people get forced to the edge of metropolitan areas
1254955 the only answer over time is that the jobs come to them
1254956 we kind of fell into the trap of our neighbors
1254957 but ill be honest if i was single guy if we didnt have a kid and my wife was for it i would probably move out of the area
1254958 this is very suggestive that there is a fundamental change going on in the electorate
1254959 obviously these are not good numbers for the party to be looking at democrats have always had extremely broad multifaceted registration programs
1254960 i think the key in this one is where do all these new independent voters break
1254961 i think right now youve got a guy in western pennsylvania saying i am really disgusted right now and im not going to register as a republican anymore but i really dont want this guy obama elected
1254962 i think nationally and here people are kind of tired of the way this administration has been conducting the policies of this country
1254963 it is not that people move to those areas and change positions it tends now to be a self selection of singles childless couples
1254964 major political realignment is not just controlling the branches of government
1254965 it is when you decisively do it we havent seen that in modern generations
1254966 you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain
1254967 i dont understand why women use botox this doesnt make them look more young this makes them look as they have used botox as procedure you will never look like 25 years what can you do about it
1254968 it is very hard for actresses when we talk about a foreground we can see things that in other conditions we wouldnt observe
1254969 the technology called slydial lets callers dial a mobile phone but avoid an unwanted conversation or unwanted intimacy on the other end
1254970 but to read a newspaper and then keep your trap shut is to miss the point newspapers are designed to be read and argued over youve got to spend social currency to make social currency
1254971 you think im an arrogant expletive who thinks hes above the law and i think youre a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong
1254972 while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1254973 further analysis has revealed un earth like aspects of the soil chemistry
1254974 would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country
1254975 he said we couldnt afford to say no to anyone
1254976 if i had better foresight maybe i could have improved things a little bit
1254977 but frankly if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job in the first place
1254978 the top people should be booted out and replaced by executives who have the confidence of the markets
1254979 this company has to answer to shareholders to our regulator and to congress and those groups often demand completely contradictory things
1254980 sure its hard to deal with the pressures of congress and shareholders and regulators
1254981 but thats why executives get paid so much its not acceptable to blame those pressures for making bad choices
1254982 there is little to nothing that freddie mac could have done to prevent the losses that it is now incurring
1254983 youve got the worst housing crisis in u s recorded history and were the largest housing finance company in the country so when one goes down the other goes with it
1254984 the thinking was that if something really bad happened to the housing market then the government would need freddie and fannie more than ever and would have to rescue them
1254985 everybody understood that at some level the company was putting taxpayers at risk
1254986 it basically worked exactly as everyone expected when things got bad the government came to the rescue
1254987 but we didnt expect it would come at the cost of a new regulator who now has the power to burrow into our business forever
1254988 ive had four other jobs as c e o and i came out of them all pretty well
1254989 what im working for right now is to save my reputation
1254990 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
1254991 this lawsuit and her head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear
1254992 gov palin should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear
1254993 after mughniyehs assassination the president apparently stripped shawkat of many of his powers
1254994 suleiman would have been involved in that process and it was known that shawkat hated suleiman
1254995 the major issue now facing syria is its relationship with iran and hezbollah and how it can reconcile that with talking to israel
1254996 the assassination means there is a power struggle going on in syria and it most probably concerns iran people like this dont just die unless something is going on
1254997 intentional constant and systematic attempts are being made to erode the achievements of the kemalist ataturk revolution turning religion into an ideology will politicize it and religion will then be the biggest loser
1254998 the military is the sole appointed guardian of the foundation of the turkish republic so they will be allergic to any kind of islamism
1254999 but after what we have just passed through he will be much more cautious than buyukanit

1255002 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1255003 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1255004 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1255005 the situation could well have been as bad as this say five years ago we just didnt know but now we have a much better indication of the state of the worlds primates and the news is not good
1255006 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1255007 one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1255008 the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy
1255009 we have to drill here and drill now not wait and see if theres areas to explore not wait and see if theres a package to put together
1255010 i want the fuel efficient cars of tomorrow to be built not in japan not in china but here in the united states of america here in michigan
1255011 its so disappointing to see obama now say he would consider expanding offshore drilling even though he knows it is not a real solution to the energy crisis
1255012 it was pretty cramped down there the whole terminal was down there
1255013 i dont think anything will be getting out of chicago tonight
1255014 the wind picked up and in probably five seconds it blew my friend into her husband
1255015 he grabbed her and pulled her inside and we all ran down the stairs it was like dead still and then within five seconds 10 seconds we were all blown away

1255057 dan ini belum dilakukan meski secara parsial memang muncul demokratisasi pemerintahan yang bersih antikorupsi penegakan supremasi hukum dan segala macam itu semua partai punya cuma bagaimana hal itu diperjuangkan belum sepenuhnya solid dalam visi parpol parpol
1255058 padahal mestinya parpol itu lebih diikat oleh kesamaan platform atau visi bukan kesamaan identitas kultural seperti sama sama nu sama sama muhammadiyah atau lainnya hal sama juga terjadi di golkar yang ikatan anggotanya lebih karena sama sama oportunisme bukan karena persamaan visi
1255059 contohnya adalah apa yang terjadi di pdi p kalau memang benar pdi p sungguh commit pada wong cilik mengapa itu tidak tercermin dalam tingkah laku para elite atau kebijakan di legislatif juga kenapa kalau ideologisnya nasionalis pada pemerintahan megawati banyak aset negara dijual
1255060 soal apakah ada pilihan lain itu soal lain elite partailah yang harus melihat kembali apakah ideologinya itu masih relevan ideologi harus menjadi semacam safety belt dalam situasi seperti apa pun
1255061 dengan berkuasa mereka punya akses ke hal hal yang bisa menambah sesuatu yang selama ini diburu yakni kekayaan sesederhana itu politik di indonesia sekarang ini
1255062 jauh melampaui golkar golkar tak ada apa apanya dibandingkan dengan pks dalam hal ini nah itu yang dirindukan oleh rakyat kader kadernya juga bagus tidak hanya di tingkat pimpinan tetapi sampai ke bawah jadi kalau menurut saya contender utama golkar adalah pks ia bisa menggantikan posisi pdi p kemarin jusuf kalla sendiri mengakui lawan terberat adalah pks pks sekarang ini sudah punya captive market bahkan pks bisa mengalahkan golkar dalam pemilihan presiden asalkan tidak terjebak pada politicized atau kepentingan sempit sesaat itu bisa saja itu karena pemilih kita cukup cerdas pemilih kita tidak memilih partai lagi mereka memilih orang
1255063 imaji megawati adalah pemimpin yang gagal sudah kongres di bali kemarin secara prosedural tidak sah ia sudah ditinggalkan semua orang kuatnya termasuk laksamana sukardi roy bb janis sophan sophiaan muchtar buchori dan lain lain yang kuat atau punya integritas sudah menyingkir semua yang masih bertahan hanya kelompok kelompok kepentingan sempit yang sebenarnya sudah menghancurkan megawati dan pdi p itu yang tetap membentengi megawati dan tetap mengajukan megawati di luar itu ada kelompok minoritas misalnya non islam yang merasa tak punya chance
1255064 reputasi kader nu yang berpolitik itu tidak mempunyai prinsip yang ada pada nu hanya kepentingan kepentingan sempit sesaat ini juga tercermin di pkb padahal mestinya politik itu ada prinsip untuk bisa nyampur dengan hati rakyat dan itu tak ada dalam tradisi politik nu
1255065 ambil contoh dalam pemilu kemarin begitu mudahnya mereka berkoalisi dengan orang orang yang dianggap antagonis secara prinsip seperti salahuddin wahid dengan wiranto hasyim dengan mega gus dur dengan wardah karena tak ada prinsip tak ada pegangan dan tak ada panutan di dalam partai itu dalam kondisi berbeda bisa bertolak belakang sama sekali dalam sehari bisa berubah 180 derajat
1255066 kita lihat saja bisa saja dia berubah tetapi he said so dan kelihatannya dia tidak berubah memang dia harus hati hati supaya dia tidak kehilangan sama sekali para pendukungnya tetapi paling tidak imaji sebagai pemimpin yang bagus dibandingkan dengan ketua ketua partai yang lain dimiliki oleh jusuf kalla
1255067 jadi posisi jusuf kalla cukup kuat di golkar jadi kalau dikatakan golkar itu solid solid jaringan partai ini seperti kita ketahui cukup bagus jadi saya melihat golkar jadi berjalan sendiri jauh di depan yang lain ketinggalan ada suara suara yang mengatakan golkar mengacaukan partai partai lain tetapi enggak perlu dikacaukan mereka sudah kacau sendiri kok

1255094 the majority of the patient load at bucca is handled by medics like me its our responsibility to take notes and decide who the real doctor needs to see but i was not qualified to assess many of the symptoms in front of me
1255095 theres no central database the medical files for nearly 20 000 detainees are kept entirely on paper save for the hospital visits
1255096 if such things arise we dont turn our back these are the kinds of things we discuss with them
1255097 we are responsible for providing world class health care to the 20 000 security detainees in iraq to the same high standard we provide to the 8 000 coalition soldiers who support the facilities
1255098 the medics vary they have basic emergency training and this is the apprenticeship the medics very much enjoy this because they get direct learning from a fully qualified physician every day
1255099 to be honest im happy because it is better than the medical facilities in our prisons i find in bucca they have very good medical treatment

1255141 it is our interest and desire to have elephants back at the philadelphia zoo in a financially responsible way and in a way thats right for the elephants
1255142 a lot of the behavior around having a baby and birthing a calf and taking care of a calf maternal care is learned beahvior we want them to learn from our elephants
1255143 i dont think it is fair to a guy who is 75 yesterdays 75 is not the 75 of the 1950s if you stop screening and treating men at 75 you are going to have a lot more people dying of prostate cancer

1255149 youre talking about raising the cost of living on working californians at precisely the time inflation is beginning to raise its ugly head
1255150 the last thing that hardworking californians need right now is in effect an increase to their cost of living by making everything they purchase with the exception of food and medicine more expensive
1255151 weve always said everything is on the table and thats still the case
1255152 they are trying to drive us out of beijing they say we create a negative image they treat us like refugees and criminals
1255153 they are cracking down on us more than ever before they regard us as enemies who will disrupt the stability of the country
1255154 they ask us to embrace the olympic games to love their country love the party but they dont love us
1255155 she was yelling help help it was like a kidnapping
1255156 it was shocking the police car didnt even have license plates
1255157 theyve been told that if any of their people disrupt the olympic games they will be held responsible and could lose their own jobs that is why they are desperate and will do anything to get them back
1255158 even getting off the train i was worried they would see me
1255159 we cant go anywhere in beijing without somebody asking to see our identity card
1255160 the authorities knew that if they attacked the drug trafficking and took away that cash flow that the delinquents would look for something else
1255161 the tragic death of fernando marti symbolizes what many mexicans are living through

1255168 real estate is all about location location location the same house in new york city would go for 20 million minimum in beverly hills or some place like that in southern california its probably 40 million
1255169 ill be 44 in january and ive never taken a beating a real beating in the ring how many fighters my age or any age can say that
1255170 in my heart of hearts i believe the last time i lost was when i fought roy jones jr in 1993 some would say im in denial but there are thousands of people heck millions of people who believe i won both fights with jermain taylor and the one with joe calzaghe some judges might say otherwise but the public knows who the real winner of a fight is
1255171 i think people still want to see me and roy jones jr before we both head off to the retirement home
1255172 you dont even have to ask the question this time
1255173 i aint guaranteeing nothing but weve got a good chance of going over there and bringing the gold medal back

1255193 the hamas movement persists with its campaign against the national groups and factions and civil society organizations
1255194 still arrests dr zakariya al agha member of the ec plo and the fatah central committee in addition to hundreds of cadres and leaders including governors and regional leaders of fatah
1255195 persists with the closure of dozens of official national and private institutions and radio stations prevents the entry of newspapers and bans citizens from their basic freedoms of movement expression meeting and demonstration which proves that hamas is moving towards imposing a unilateral dark rule that doesnt accept any participation and doesnt allow any opposition
1255196 strongly condemns the crimes committed by hamas as well as the arbitrary measures the movement imposes on our people

1255205 the government believes it can advance toward a centralized state run economic system but thats going to cause more conflict with the business community
1255206 as we stated last week we believe weve made a fair offer and we look forward to a response from imclones board on that offer
1255207 while the news regarding a potential imclone restructuring was unexpected imclones response to the initial bristol myers offer was not
1255208 accordingly the board is reviewing whether bristol myers had access to confidential information concerning imclone and its pipeline
1255209 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
1255210 this lawsuit and her head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear
1255211 gov palin should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear
1255212 the ecb will likely maintain the refinancing rate at 4 25 percent
1255213 despite increasing downside risks to growth ecb president jean claude trichet will probably renew warnings on the central banks commitment to fight second round effects he should stick to the neutral bias mantra
1255214 clearly a further interest rate hike is a real possibility and the ecb is very likely to keep talking tough on inflation
1255215 nevertheless we believe that 4 25 percent will mark the peak in euro zone interest rates although any cut is extremely unlikely to occur until 2009
1255216 we expect markedly weaker euro zone growth softening labor markets extended tight credit conditions and the strong euro to largely contain and then increasingly dilute underlying inflation pressures over the coming months
1255217 the boe should leave the rate at 5 percent this week
1255218 unchanged interest rates seem by far the most probable outcome
1255219 but it is not inconceivable that interest rates could be either raised or cut
1255220 although we would not rule out a cut in november before being cut steadily to 4 25 percent by mid 2009 and to 3 75 percent by the fourth quarter of next year
1255221 for some chinese companies you could argue they need only five to 15 years to develop a global brand
1255222 perhaps consumers all over the world will think china is all low end but we want to be the high end
1255223 to change that view is very difficult but we have no choice
1255224 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1255225 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1255226 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1255227 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1255228 we feel very strongly that weve got enough to make it to key milestones in our program
1255229 youve got declining home prices very tight credit conditions a soft jobs market and a weak stock market the consumer has got a lot to deal with

1255251 to provide for a mere slap on the wrist of those convicted of serious economic crimes with no or virtually no time imprisoned as punishment strikes a blow to the integrity of our criminal justice system in the end if not corrected the majoritys approach will be dangerous to respect for our legal system can it be seriously maintained that wilful offenders who commit white collar crime who steal intentionally hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars should receive no forced incarceration while those poor and powerless criminal defendants who commit common larceny or theft often serve extensive hard time

1255261 i actually sent out a memo in may that encouraged people to think twice about discretionary spending
1255262 ive been stacking up and not approving out of state travel the past couple of weeks
1255263 i have full confidence in my team that we will do this in a way that protects core responsibilities protects clients and the public
1255264 were looking now at what it means to the department we have to ensure safety not only safety of the vessels but also safe freeway and highway operations
1255265 further gov gregoire should suspend salary negotiations with state employee groups over pay increases until we know the full extent of our deficit next year
1255266 i am asking each of you to step up your efforts to increase savings i ask that you be creative and take action now
1255267 the high price of energy is hurting our businesses and our families anything we can do to reduce fuel consumption will ease the burden on our budget and on taxpayers
1255268 its across the board except for exemptions for certain public safety positions
1255269 at vipr industries we are fully committed to corporate integrity and transparency we are working to elevate our listing from the pink sheets to the otcbb holding ourselves to higher standards of financial reporting and shareholder communication we believe moving to a higher exchange will enhance viprs ability to raise awareness in the investment community increase our access to capital and provide detailed disclosure for the benefit of current and potential shareholders
1255270 regular moisturizers are designed to add moisture onto the skin
1255271 however they dont repair the protective layer of the skin so its an endless cycle of constant moisture application onto the skin without healing and curing the dry skin
1255272 there are thousands of irritants in our environment that werent around decades ago
1255273 soaps shampoos and cleansers strip away the skins natural barrier i see many instances of contact dermatitis where the natural coating has been stripped just from daily use of soaps and other irritants at that point any chemical can enter the skin shielding lotion helps restore that barrier so the skin is protected against harsh chemicals it is an excellent skin care treatment product
1255274 we are very pleased to have been able to utilize the data from the previous drilling campaigns conducted by kennecott climax and amax and to convert this data into a cim compliant resource statement in such a short amount of time we are confident that this statement can be used as the basis for a preliminary economic assessment that will be followed with a full feasibility study
1255275 ya vez por guey ahita ahita no que no no guey
1255276 present durante el entrenamiento un bloqueo en su rodilla izquierda se hizo lo adecuado se le desbloqueo va a estar en observaci n le realizaremos algunos estudios y daremos los pron sticos en 24 48 horas esto implica que una parte del menisco que hace que en cierta posici n y despu s de ello se le hizo las maniobras para el desbloqueo
1255277 el jugador sufri un traumatismo indirecto en su rodilla izquierda al sufrir una torci n rotaci n presentando dolor e incapacidad para movilizar su rodilla
1255278 con un diagn stico cl nico el bloqueo articular se procedi a realizar maniobras para desbloquear la misma previo medicaci n sublingual e intramuscular y cediendo progresivamente el dolor y recuperando la movilidad articular se contin o con crioterapia y estar en observaci n en las pr ximas 36 a 48 horas por lo que est en duda su participaci n en la pr xima jornada 2 ante los tigres
1255279 me sent con un poquito de impotencia porque tuve dos o tres oportunidades para marcar me sent muy bien f sicamente me siento bien y creo que ya no hay que perdonar m s creo que la que uno tenga hay que concretar
1255280 creo que sin ninguna presi n yo creo que el equipo viene jugando bien por ah no se llegaba tanto ahora s y creo que vamos a tener muchas oportunidades y la que tengamos meterla
1255281 no pero yo creo que las oportunidades hay que meterlas si no metemos goles no vamos a ganar nunca
1255282 no no recuerdo que tengas oportunidades as que tienes dos o tres otras veces he metido un gol pero as de tener tres y sin marcar un gol no
1255283 es como me dec a el profe que estuve en la jugada del gol y estamos llegando que es lo principal antes por ah nada m s ten amos una y bien dif cil y ahora estamos llegando
1255284 creo que del mediocampo para atr s estamos siendo fuertes y la defensa sin duda est bien parada atr s que es lo principal y dejar el arco de nosotros en cero
1255285 ac tengo que estar tranquilo van las primeras fechas creo que vamos a tener muchas oportunidades as que trabajaremos de buena forma y siempre con la fe en dios
1255286 de fracaso no y de c balas y de todo eso yo no creo en eso yo creo en dios y en el trabajo en la fe que uno tenga de hacer el trabajo de hoy
1255287 creo que tenemos que mostrar la misma cara que mostramos con pachuca con esa intensidad con esas ganas con esos deseos con esa manera de jugar por momentos creo que esa es la manera correcta o el camino ideal para este equipo
1255288 la idea es tratar de jugar siempre de la misma manera tanto de local como de visitante mostrar siempre la misma cara y eso es lo que vamos a intentar
1255289 s empezamos a trabajar pensando ya en jaguares creo que se sacaron cosas positivas del partido de pachuca y cosas tambi n por mejorar y creo que jaguares es un lindo partido como para poder traernos un buen resultado y seguir por el camino correcto
1255290 la presi n siempre est tanto de local como de visitante creo que la obligaci n siempre est y ahora no es la excepci n
1255291 creo que tenemos que sumar todav a falta esto reci n comienza pero es claro que no tenemos que dejar escapar ning n punto porque despu s puede ser tarde as que tenemos que empezar a sumar creo que el equipo est preparado para eso y tiene muchos deseos muchas ganas de que sea como visitante
1255292 tener confianza en nosotros en lo que hacemos aqu en casa pues hacerlo afuera el equipo ha habido torneos en que hemos hecho muy buenos torneos fuera y creo que esa ha sido la diferencia cuando se tienen buenos torneos afuera en t rminos generales el a o es mucho mejor en todos los sentidos
1255293 entonces hay que estar confiados en nosotros y tratar de hacer lo que hacemos de locales
1255294 claro entre m s jugadores est n es mucho mejor para el equipo tener el plantel completo ojal lo tuvi ramos todas las fechas porque as manolo puede escoger a los 11 jugadores que entran a la cancha y podemos tener m s jugadores de recambio
1255295 la idea es trabajar todos juntos todos jalando hacia el mismo objetivo pensando en ganar cada uno de los partidos y entre todos est n mejor bienvenidos
1255296 la idea es seguir mejorando en todos los sentidos hicimos un buen juego en t rminos generales pero es un hecho que tenemos que seguir mejorando porque tenemos que sacar victorias tenemos que dar m s
1255297 estamos con la idea de ir por la victoria a chiapas no ganamos el primer partido creo que hicimos un buen juego pero no se sac la victoria ahora hay que tratar de ganar fuera creo que el equipo ha trabajado duro a lo largo de toda la pretemporada en este inicio y todo lo que se est haciendo es para tratar de sumar y sacar los resultados
1255298 no s que nos pasa en mi instancia en tigres no hemos podido jugar de la misma manera de visitante y no se por qu no basta con hacer valer s lo tu condici n de local yo creo que ya es hora de que este equipo consiga puntos de visitante ya es momento que muestre una gran personalidad de visitante que sea un equipo fuerte en cualquier cancha que pise
1255299 obviamente de visitante tienes que plantear los partidos diferente pero no hemos sabido en qu momentos atacar en qu momento ir por el partido
1255300 que se den goleadas jaguares perdi 0 5 en cancha de atlas ya son circunstanciales me parece que jaguares no sali en un muy buen partido y eso no quiere decir que vaya a ser lo mismo va a ser un partido muy duro en su cancha con su gente as que tenemos que prepararnos para eso
1255301 me siento listo ya estoy al 100 por ciento la semana pasada hice trabajo f sico y hoy hay que trabajar en la semana por si el profe me necesita es cuesti n de estar m s concentrados y ser contundentes al frente con el trabajo en la semana y bien concentrados el gol tiene que caer
1255302 tambi n quiero felicitar a los jugadores y a los clubes cuyo comportamiento fue excelente acataron las decisiones que se tomaron y se hizo un muy buen papel
1255303 lo de bautista fue en nico negrito en el arroz pero creo que en t rminos generales se hizo un buen trabajo esperemos seguir igual
1255304 el profe habl conmigo y me dijo que lo importante es que estuve ah para tener las oportunidades yo tengo mucha confianza es apenas el inicio del campeonato y estoy seguro que voy a salir adelante
1255305 nunca me hab a pasado esto siempre tengo una o dos oportunidades y anoto una
1255306 el jugador est cerca de regresar y bien que lo necesita el equipo ya que se ha visto inoperante no se le ve futbol y esto no ayuda nada al equipo en la tabla del descenso
1255307 gm brian cashman was trying to get a catcher as soon as i went down i think pudge just kind of fell into his lap

1255312 nunca he pensado en eso nunca en mi vida he abandonado algo ni siquiera voy a empezar a pensarlo a mis 64 a os de vida se me hace absurdo yo vine aqu a ganar a triunfar y a ganar otro t tulo no quiero fracasar punto
1255313 por supuesto que lo veo con pasta de campe n usted ve a al santos con pasta de campe n cuando se iba a ir a lo que me refiero es que yo no dudo de mi equipo
1255314 si no hay tiradero a tigres no hay noticias buenas hoy
1255315 al equipo grande de la ciudad siempre se le carga mas la mano si no hay notas sensacionalistas de ellos no hay nada
1255316 las palabras del se or miloc son de total relevancia tiene toda la razon las tribunas del universitario ya perdieron esa esencia que solo tenia el equipo de esta ciudad ahora la cancha parece acto de reunion de muchos alcoholicos sin juicio comun solo ven algo bien y le aplauden ven algo mal lo revientan a muerte esta gente se esta envolviendo como la de enfrente si por algo de distingia la gente de tigres es que era de temperamento caliente
1255317 perdimos la oportunidad de ganar tres puntos en casa tuvimos cuatro llegadas no supimos terminar nos falt el toque final est tambi n el m rito del arquero calero tuvo buenas intervenciones
1255318 las ocasiones claras que tuve quiz s por ah la primera tapo muy bien la entrada m a con la pelota sale bien a jugar con las piernas creo que es m rito de l calero
1255319 labor cumplida bien hecho san cadilla lograste lo que quer amos polemizar y que la gente volteara a verte vas a recibir un aumento de sueldo

1255321 ya estoy bien en el juego contra el atl tico de madrid sal con un peque o tir n en el muslo derecho pero ya estoy bien hoy no sent ninguna molestia
1255322 yo creo que ante jaguares no voy a jugar aunque ya me siento bien tengo que esperar que me d de alta el traumat logo y entonces ver qu decide el cuerpo t cnico
1255323 ya la tenemos la camisa en la piel estoy bien rayado
1255324 va a ser un partido muy dif cil trataremos de aprovechar esa circunstancia de las ausencias de jaguares aunque un equipo de primera divisi n tiene 25 o 28 jugadores que pueden ser titulares

1255340 my parents wouldnt let me play because i was a little bigger when i was growing up they thought id be playing with guys three years older than me and getting hurt they didnt want to risk it
1255341 my grandfather refereed in the nfl for over 30 years and my uncle played for the university of miami
1255342 i had a great time there for five year and won a national championship
1255343 once i got to playing football i was under the realization that i was always the smallest guy on the offensive line
1255344 my first year starting in college i weighed 265 pounds and i was definitely the lightest guy on the line
1255345 it just goes to show you that its as much up here as anything
1255346 chris isnt the biggest guy but hes definitely not small either
1255347 it all starts with what the center tells the line to do
1255348 they have to trust him and what he sees initially
1255349 im happy to have him here an extra buddy weve got such a great nucleus of guys on the team hes a great addition
1255350 im looking to help them out with the zone running scheme
1255351 so far were having fun with it were going to do some big things this season i cant wait to get to regular season games
1255352 the last two years have been hard i was feeling so much pain this is the first time in two years i can honestly say im just playing and not worrying about my knee
1255353 could start for probably any other team in the nfl
1255354 i know theres a strong possibility that i might not make this team
1255355 for individual goals it stinks but as a guy who wants to see the texans do good thats a good thing
1255356 once you get to the point where you feel like if you dont make the team your life ends
1255357 in philly i was oblivious you never heard from the texans you never saw their games on tv you knew they were a young struggling team what kubiak and them have done the last two years is pretty amazing its a playoff type atmosphere we work hard we have defined leaders
1255358 one thing about philly during training camp we knew good guys good players were going to get cut
1255359 now were to that point where were a playoff type team were going to have guys picked up by other teams maybe even start for other teams who wont make this team
1255360 coming from nigeria they thought football was a brutal sport
1255361 they didnt like the fact that it took away from my study time because both of my parents are all about education its funny my sophomore year at san antonios marshall high i got my first letter from northwestern university and then my parents realized you can get a full scholarship the next game my dad was there cheering like any other parent
1255362 if i dont make the team ive already got my season tickets
1255363 i am going to be up there screaming at earl cochran to make a play
1255364 i dont know what was said or written i just tried to focus on doing my job as well as i could
1255365 we knew he worked hard we thought he might fit with what were doing
1255366 hes improved from the otas organized team activities and minicamp hes making more plays on the ball down the field you can tell hes more confident with what were doing i love his attitude he works so hard
1255367 im working hard and having fun im getting more and more comfortable with what the coaches want me to do and what were doing on defense this is a young team the players are hungry i love playing with guys like this
1255368 they want me to get in the receivers face and turn and run with him
1255369 one thing ive learned in this league is that youve got to play solid technique ive got to keep my eyes focused on the receiver you can run like carl lewis but if you dont play good technique youre going to get beat in this league
1255370 im happy with the way things are going im excited about the season and im doing everything i can to get better
1255371 is the old wild and crazy madonna making a comeback
1255372 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar not like the cannes film festival where nobodys speaking english or the tribeca film festival where no one sits down

1255387 not in fashion but in architecture if you are lucky enough to know the greatest living architect and to have her accept an invitation to do a project it is magical this all began with a small sketch a computer drawing a concept i gave zaha the general idea in a few moments and her interpretation and fulfilment of that idea is more than perfect
1255388 the fascination of the project was the challenge of translating the intellectual and physical into the sensual experimenting with completely unexpected spaces and a totally immersive environment
1255389 but he played rugby cycled and loved running he spent his childhood outside and had been burnt a couple of times
1255390 with hindsight the mole had grown and another one had popped up on his neck
1255391 i presumed it was a chest infection and told him to go to the doctor
1255392 two weeks later he went for the results by himself
1255393 thats how unconcerned we were id taken the boys to the park he phoned and said it was cancer a huge shock but we both believed everything would be ok
1255394 the patients were 80 year old men whod been out in the desert as soldiers but theyd had basal cell carcinoma neil had malignant melanoma which is resistant to radiotherapy catch it early enough with surgery fine if it spreads nothing works
1255395 i never knew of anyone who had died from it i just thought its a bit of surgery itll be fine
1255396 dr harries called it an evil cancer because its so resistant to treatments
1255397 but neil wasnt the kind of man whod sit in pity we told ourselves neil was fit young we were positive hed be one of the six survivors for sure
1255398 it was quite major as the mole was deep and needed a 5cm incision neil opted to have both sides of his neck lymph nodes out just in case then he had skin grafts taken from his leg
1255399 the consultant said there might be some slight advantage to having radiotherapy
1255400 thats normal for most cancers to kill off anything that might be missed but not as i knew by now for malignant melanoma still neil wanted to do everything he possibly could to recover
1255401 neil went to the hospital every day he even started cycling again
1255402 the paramedics came and he continued to have fits in the ambulance it was terrifying thankfully the boys were with their grandmother
1255403 this is where its a disadvantage to be an nhs worker
1255404 people have asked why we didnt push to get back to guys but when theres no bed theres no bed i know thats the way it is
1255405 but he clung on and came round afterwards though he was aggressive like he had tourettes syndrome
1255406 he nodded and said i always knew id die young his dad had died of a heart attack when neil was 15 it must have always played on his mind
1255407 we planned to go to center parcs in february we had neils sister katies wedding coming up but we knew it wasnt for ever
1255408 thankfully thomas was enjoying school he was spending half an hour a day with neil our aim now was to get neil home to die
1255409 i told thomas on wednesday the 5th daddys coming home tomorrow he was bouncing with excitement
1255410 his last words were im tired im going to go to sleep now he died at 1pm on thursday
1255411 and i broke his heart i told him his daddy had died he has since said to me mummy i hate you you said my daddy was dead you should have said he was back at home ill never forgive myself for that
1255412 if thomas or patrick asks me whether their daddys life could have been saved i will say to them yes if hed had his moles checked earlier
1255413 if youre worried about a mole go to your gp or local skin clinic immediately

1255420 weve stated often our support for this deal and the belief that its important not only for the bilateral relationship but also for nuclear security in the rest of the world
1255421 but now that the iaea has voted were going to look to discuss this issue with the members of the nuclear suppliers group were hoping to get a positive result out of that some time in the next month
1255422 and then hopefully well be able to represent this to congress on september 8

1255425 the congress and the cpi m are appeasing the illegal migrants everyone knows it both parties are concerned about losing their vote banks and are silent on the issue bjp is a better party in this respect

1255429 does not imply in any way the indian scriptural terms are parallel to biblical terms or that the parallel references are saying the same thing as the biblical text

1255431 an attempt has been made to give a bible which is more relevant for india there is nothing added or subtracted from the text of the bible which has been reproduced as such
1255432 we cannot simply have a re reproduction of the bible people must be able to assimilate and appreciate the bible the texts of the bible must come alive
1255433 but actually for us christ is the light we can use it as a prayer of divine light which illumine the human mind
1255434 for so many centuries we have not been able to read the text of the sacred scripture without indian traditions at the background our sacred text also must become meaningful to indians of different religions it will help to project our bible in their context

1255442 its about 45 to 50 of the properties sold here this time last year repossessions were probably only around 30
1255443 there are no signs of the securitisation markets opening something major needs to happen to kick start the mortgage industry perhaps not back to the levels that we saw in 2005 to 2007 but perhaps back to a level that would support the economic growth of the country
1255444 people need to accept that there has been a correction of between 12 and 15 in prices depending on where you are

1255465 we are well aware of overcrowding and have pushed hard for extra capacity for customers we have developed plans for an increase in capacity following an independent study into the cambridge and peterborough routes this will see us deploy five additional four car trains
1255466 four routes will have 12 carriages instead of eight as part of the new timetable starting in may 2009 we will have 1 779 more seats during the morning peak and 2 490 during the evening peak an increase of 15 per cent
1255467 at kings cross it was like a stampede you would have to be there 15 minutes before the train was due to leave then there was a headlong rush to the platform it was common for the aisle to be packed when i go to london now i have resorted to taking the bus
1255468 it is just a hobby but i really enjoy it people have brought me things back from holiday and some of the older key rings you cannot buy any more
1255469 they know me at a lot of the shops in cambridge
1255470 in my will i am going to donate it all to the rspca i used to let people come in to see it but i had some things stolen so i dont any more
1255471 modelled using the design vehicles for the guideway which are 15 m triaxles with steering rear axles and 18 m long articulated buses
1255472 when im cycling along im too often overtaken by one of these buses which pulls into a bus stop forcing me to stop inside it until it pulls away again
1255473 its even worse when one overtakes and turns left cutting me off this is particularly intimidating when there are pedestrian guard rails at the junction
1255474 this is madness with its constricted street pattern the last thing cambridge needs is bendy buses
1255475 because of the hazards that they present to other road users particularly cyclists bendy buses are to be withdrawn in london starting next year we do not want them here
1255476 i dont want bendy buses in cambridge i think they are lethal they are certainly anti cyclist and there is no way under my portfolio there will be bendy buses in cambridge
1255477 the design criteria for the guided busway include all types of buses which are currently allowed on the countrys roads
1255478 this does not necessarily mean that we will be using either 15m long buses or articulated buses but it would be short sighted to build facilities that were intended to last many years that took no account of future possibilities
1255479 since i was elected in may i have had a number of complaints from residents about this and have brought them to the attention of the environmental team
1255480 many residents in the block of flats in that area have just one window that points towards the back of the shop and are being woken every morning at around 5am
1255481 all i want is to be able to sleep with my window open everyone is pretty ratty with the lack of sleep and its like living with the noise of a 747 frankly
1255482 not only do we have the constant hum of the cooling compressors on the roof but we also have the fans linked to the bakery which come on at 5 14am each morning
1255483 weve had the environmental health officer round to come and do testing and so have our neighbours but its about the lack of respect tesco seem to have had for the community
1255484 we have asked them nicely but they have failed to sort it out so now weve had to complain officially
1255485 we do regard tesco as a good neighbour however a refitting of the cooling systems on the site for the purposes of energy efficiency has led to unacceptable levels of noise we are looking forward to a speedy resolution of the matter with tesco
1255486 step up act out is an opportunity for young people with an interest in theatre and dance to develop their skills or try something new during a month packed full of creative workshops
1255487 rule one two and three dont leave your shelter in bad weather
1255488 there is a lot of work to be done all the sites identified have issues there are challenges which have to be addressed
1255489 none of this is going to happen overnight all the sites require planning permission it hasnt got a time line against it at the moment this is a starting point it could be less than 10 years
1255490 we are very heartened we have very much bought into the original report they did a couple of years ago and to have the feasibility study now presented shows some real intent on behalf of horizons and the government
1255491 although im slightly biased with an interest in cambridge united it would be good for the community as a whole
1255492 city is a community club and a community stadium needs a community club
1255493 this report is the first stage and now its up to everyone in cambridge to decide whether they want a community stadium not just the clubs but local authorities the politicians there needs to be greater political will for this to happen
1255494 cambridge united want to set up a new stadium and its probably best for cambridge united and the actual town of cambridge that they do have a new one somewhere
1255495 we would be quite happy to ground share but the reality would mean us moving away from where we are
1255496 we are really excited at the prospect of it our major concerns are the time it would take and how it would be funded
1255497 as with most other people who may be involved what are the commercial spin offs going to be
1255498 its a good thing for cambridge but its got to be done right and it has to bring real value to the city of cambridge
1255499 its so early at the moment we are looking at whether the numbers will stack up the usage and location we would be working with the city council and south cambridgeshire district council all the local organisations to find the best place for it
1255500 the site is within the green belt and milton parish council has in the past opposed development in the green belt
1255501 as a council we have not been able to discuss the report our next meeting is at the beginning of september we have not had a planning application for the site to become a community stadium but if we do get one i am sure the village will want to have their say and we will be keeping them informed
1255502 its certainly worthy of consideration and will have to be worked on in terms of practical use and long term viability to each of the local clubs concerned
1255503 people were leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the top of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice of emmanuel goldstein that came from the screen

1255507 one person cant slide down the slide while one person is in the pool let alone have 2 people sitting in it the slide is so small and when you turn on the hose to let the sprinklers come down the orange top collapses and has no use
1255508 the increased bandwidth will allow us to send digital radiology images from district hospitals to experts in our capital kigali and outside the country
1255509 given that the overwhelming majority of our population lives in rural areas this will allow many more patients to easily secure specialist opinion at significantly reduced cost
1255510 tracnet is successful because it was designed as a bottom up model that links record systems in health centers and antiretroviral therapy sites across the country to a central data warehouse
1255511 the sooner they get to the field the sooner will they contribute to the improvement of the security situation in our zone of operation
1255512 the baby was delivered at 12 31pm in our storeroom
1255513 from when she told us to call the ambulance to the time she took to deliver the baby was about 20 minutes in total the ambulance and paramedics only arrived about 20 minutes after the baby was born and cleaned up mother and baby were taken to somerset hospital in green point
1255514 the mother was very strong and walked out of our offices looking almost as if nothing had happened
1255515 siphokazi finished the exam and then delivered the baby about 30 minutes later she has since passed the exam and has earned the certificate
1255516 it is hard being a mom but i am enjoying it
1255517 like any parent with a teenager we had our tiffs but it was never serious we always worked through our problems and loved each other
1255518 i want shelley to come home i want to tell her that everything is all right and that i am not upset with her and that i love her
1255519 i know she is not well because i could hear that she was scared she was telling me she was fine and that she was being looked after and loved and was going to a good school
1255520 when i asked her who she was with and where she was all she would tell me was that she was with good people
1255521 i am trying not to think about the worst that can happen to shelley but i cant help it i am so afraid
1255522 shelley said she was with people who cared for her but i am so afraid that one of the people who she met on mxit has done something terrible to shelley
1255523 when i found out she was using mxit i begged her to stop saying that i was afraid that she would get hurt but she would always tell me that the people she was chatting to were fine and that she trusted them
1255524 i wish i had stopped her but i believed her and did not think that something bad like this would happen to her
1255525 i believe that when they saw the pictures they decided to target her
1255526 i am now wondering whether the people who have my daughter used this picture to lure her to them
1255527 there are wolves out there who are looking for young naive teenage girls and will do everything in their power to get to them
1255528 programs like mxit are evil and need to be banned especially as teenagers pour their hearts out to people that they have never met they are talking to people they think they know but in reality they do not know who they are really talking to
1255529 thats all in the past were getting on very well at the moment graeme who struck an unbeaten 154 at edgbaston played like a superstar on saturday and he sunk us hopefully he wont play an innings like that against us while im captain
1255530 kp will always get you runs as a player but i think the captaincy might curb his flair as a batter
1255531 i thought they might appoint a younger bloke someone like alastair cook and build him up thats what happened with me
1255532 id be very worried that it will have a negative effect on pietersens batting hes a good thinking cricketer but it will be crucial how he relates to his team mates
1255533 im very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
1255534 its a huge honour and a terrific challenge for me
1255535 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job
1255536 my immediate priority will be this weeks test and i will be devoting all my energies to ensuring that the team are properly prepared and play to their full potential
1255537 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
1255538 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future
1255539 this was an emotional decision and it was right to speak to my wife jessica my mum and dad and my brothers i then went to see the coach peter moores and we had a really good meeting its all about looking forward now and making sure we achieve what we want to
1255540 i will always respect what has happened in the past and i will always respect what michael did and what my predecessors did
1255541 i will always look for advice because im new in this job and ive had calls and messages from the senior players in the squad once you have the support of the lads around you you cant ask for any more
1255542 but ill have my own ways its a brand new test and a bright new challenge for me
1255543 ive gained a good cricket brain in terms of what i think about the way i play i like to do what i feel is right instinctively
1255544 thats the kind of positive approach thats helped me be successful its my gut instinct in my batting
1255545 the first step has already been given that was the qualification to the olympic games now i will try to compete at the same level of the opponents that i will face in china
1255546 they put a lot of constraints on us with the age group
1255547 pueden ser un poco m s altas de lo habitual
1255548 tardar hasta el viernes en barrer toda la pen nsula
1255549 hopefully there will be two or three players coming on board before the transfer window closes
1255550 at the end of last season i thought we needed another top striker at the club and ive not changed that view because youve got to put the ball in the back of the net

1255581 getting into the champions league is not going to be easy
1255582 to break into that quartet is tough but a number of quality players have come in and well be doing our best to get amongst it
1255583 as soon as he came you could see why he was so successful at other clubs
1255584 he has magic and is capable of anything on a football pitch his quality is amazing it would be great if he joined us and hed be made very welcome here
1255585 its been a really good way for me to get to know my new team mates and ive felt really comfortable out on the pitch
1255586 the truth is that when youve got players of the quality that we have here it was always going to make things so much easier for me to adapt
1255587 the first rule for winning football is to make sure we play well but for all that our opponents are always going to be trying to stop us from doing that sometimes the games wont be as spectacular as wed like thats just the way it is
1255588 but this team has players with great quality who can play high calibre football its the responsibility of all the players to play exciting football but im more than happy to assume that role

1255595 while we still have a considerable portion of our season in front of us im encouraged by the results especially in the current economic climate
1255596 i dont know anything about those reports and even if i did its not something we could comment about
1255597 hes a fine player and hes got confidence in bucket loads which he will probably take into his captaincy
1255598 but you dont want him to change he averages 50 odd in both forms of the game and hes an unbelievable talent
1255599 im sure everyone will ask whether his batting will be affected but knowing kevin he will probably average 70 you know what hes like whenever he is put under the pump or someone starts saying something about him he comes back with a score
1255600 hes changed a lot over the last few years and i think hes a lot happier with himself
1255601 the reason he has got the job is because he is the way he is he has to be true to himself and do it the way he wants to
1255602 hes got some very important attributes that you need in a captain
1255603 he can clearly lead by example by being a fantastic player

1255609 ja ich war im urlaub in italien und bei meinen gro eltern in bosnien ich war ein paar tage traurig kam dann aber ganz schnell auf andere gedanken

1255613 ich hab mir schon meine gedanken gemacht kein spieler sitzt gerne auf der bank aber der trainer hat es mir erkl rt auch wenn ich es oft anders gesehen habe
1255614 okay im nachhinein war es perfekt trotzdem will ich dieses jahr deutlich mehr spiele machen
1255615 nein ich mache nie schwalben aber foul ist foul wenn ich kontakt sp re falle ich hin sonst nicht

1255636 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1255637 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1255638 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy

1255645 buying an rv is a major investment and a new rver can be overwhelmed when just starting out nothing will ruin a trip or a vacation quicker than not understanding how to properly use and maintain your rv this is where the rv training videos fill such a valuable need

1255670 i obviously have very good links with real madrid but also with ac milan juventus and other top clubs
1255671 a lot of the time in england people just go for the same players you often have five or six managers watching the same player its a very closed country
1255672 what we will try to do is open our eyes and work with the likes of real madrid ac milan and juventus we arent looking only in the uk
1255673 we are lucky in that we have a reputation for doing things properly and we have been in sport a long time we know who our targets are and maybe dani is here with us for a year two years maybe forever lets see how well he does
1255674 i am from madrid and they have a big name but when i am here at qpr we are all treated the same
1255675 i am here to learn how these players play in this league and i am not afraid at all spanish players are succeeding in english football and for me the only target is to succeed in our objective which is to go into the premier league
1255676 i was with the real madrid first team this weekend and all of their players advised me to use this year to learn as much as possible and to take this opportunity
1255677 you dont get into real madrids first team at 19 unless you are extremely talented
1255678 arsene wenger is a fantastic judge of talent so if he is good enough for him he is good enough for me

1255680 one or two years in england will make him tough
1255681 the championship is very tough he is a kind of superstar in spain but he is a normal guy who will do well here
1255682 if i wasnt convinced that qpr wasnt ambitious i would not have come and i believed we will achieve our objectives this season
1255683 yep i went to mulberry yesterday and i had to check its still there

1255686 the discussion will be open and is designed to have a clear and clean situation for everybody for the 2012 olympics which will be played in london
1255687 does anyone truly understand the message of the cross apart from brokenness contrition repentance and faith to repeat rather mechanically the nature of the transaction that christians think took place at golgotha is one thing to look at god and his holiness and people and their sin

1255690 this is not an issue that we can overlook we will demand an apology
1255691 no kashmiri hurriyat leader has been able to step into jammu in the presence of the shiv sena nor would they be allowed to do so in future
1255692 syed ali shah geelani muhammad yaseen malik maulana abbas ansari shabir ahmad shah and other hurriyat leaders too should forget jammu because henceforth their entry into the city will not only be difficult but also impossible
1255693 jammu muslims are with us and a contact programme with them is on
1255694 the economic blockade of the kashmir valley will continue till kashmiri leaders come to their senses
1255695 dr abdullah is trying to earn the goodwill of his masters in delhi together with gaining electoral advantage in jammu
1255696 the manner in which the nc patron is targeting kashmiris is a part of its history of strategic bankruptcy
1255697 dr abdullah should not have made such a statement when communalists have made life miserable for jammu muslims and used the base tactic of economic blockade against kashmir
1255698 there is no weight in dr abdullahs remark that land cant be carried away on ones shoulders
1255699 dr abdullah is hanger on of the new delhi government and a victims of mental servility he has no way of knowing what a mass movement means or what freedom is
1255700 the national conference is the eternal enemy of the kashmiri people and solely responsible for the troubles the people of jammu and kashmir are in
1255701 the bjp believes that it is extremely essential to massacre muslims on a large scale if their leader lal krishen advani has to become the next prime minister of india
1255702 this party has always tried to serve its petty ends by hurting the sentiments of muslims and playing dirty politics
1255703 the frustration of the communal fanatics is clear from the murderous attacks on kashmiri drivers and the economic blockade of kashmir
1255704 but kashmiris will not be cowed down by the activities of these zealots
1255705 seeing the situation in jammu the state governor called for the services of the army and imposed curfew in many parts of the province but the irony is that that the communal parties openly target muslims despite the restrictions
1255706 this proves that the curfew is mere eye wash and an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of kashmiris
1255707 when curfew is imposed in kashmir no one is allowed to venture out of doors and if anybody dares to violate the restrictions he is riddled with bullets
1255708 the communal parties in jammu want to repeat the blood soaked era of 1947 but they must under stand that the kashmiri people will grind their plans to dust
1255709 on the one hand the nc president omar abdullah defends the kashmiri agitation against the land transfer in parliament and on the other the patron of the party advocates allotting land to the shrine board
1255710 these conflicting statements tear the veil off the ncs secret designs
1255711 in fact dr abdullah is supporting the nda and omar abdullah backs the upa in a bid to pave their way to success in the coming elections the father and son duo is playing its election card with the shrine board issue
1255712 given the number of bullets flying around the streets of toronto
1255713 id think the citys bureaucrats would be more concerned with preventing lead poisoning than skin cancer
1255714 it was a shocking and brutal murder one can only imagine the pain and suffering her family has gone through
1255715 after seven years investigators have still been receiving new information about this crime which gives everyone renewed hope that the answers are out there
1255716 the coroner has covered all aspects of the investigation and made appropriate recommendations which we will take on board
1255717 maintain the stability of the region and protect chinese interests
1255718 according to the judgment of the supreme leader of the islamic republic the guards strategy has changed accordingly the guards primary mission at this juncture is to fight the internal threats
1255719 internal security and its preservation are the tasks of the state security forces and other security organs but if the problems go beyond a certain point then the guards with the permission of the supreme national security council and the supreme leader will take charge
1255720 the whole security environment is intended to really suffocate or torpedo any possible change from within
1255721 animosity toward our revolution is never ending as we move forward the battle between the revolutionaries and counter revolutionaries becomes more critical and complicated
1255722 is equipped with the most advanced missiles that can strike the enemies vessels and naval equipment with fatal blows
1255723 an independent command might be created in irgc in order to fortify the structure and activities of the missile section
1255724 i have never visited yasukuni on august 15 and i will maintain that stance
1255725 not something i do as a person holding a public position

1255728 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
1255729 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
1255730 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
1255731 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
1255732 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
1255733 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
1255734 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
1255735 so you would be walking you wouldnt be driving at that point
1255736 and it wouldnt do any good to call the maintenance or repair people because they wouldnt be able to get there even if you could get through to them
1255737 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses
1255738 would quickly revert to an early 19th century type of country
1255739 most of the things we depend upon would be gone and we would literally be depending on our own assets and those we could reach by walking to them
1255740 people in hospitals would be dying faster than that because they depend on power to stay alive but then it would go to water food civil authority emergency services and we would end up with a country with many many people not surviving the event
1255741 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
1255742 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack
1255743 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
1255744 one of the nations in the middle east had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel they had taken a short range probably scud missile put it on a transporter erector launcher lowered it in taken the vessel out into the water peeled back the top erected it fired it lowered it and covered it up and the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50 60 100 other ships operating in the immediate area
1255745 well known to the white house but have not been disseminated to the appropriate congressional committees
1255746 could be used in a devastating stealth attack against the united states or israel for which the united states has no known or planned defense
1255747 the use of an atomic bomb against israel would destroy israel completely while the same against islamic iran only would cause damages such a scenario is not inconceivable
1255748 an emp attack on america would send us back to the horse and buggy era without the horse and buggy
1255749 if youre a terrorist this is your ultimate goal your ultimate asymmetric weapon
1255750 they could do it either directly or anonymously by putting some freighter out there on the ocean
1255751 its well known that people dont go on a diet until theyve had a heart attack
1255752 and we as a nation are having a heart attack
1255753 as of today we have no defense against such an attack we need space based missile defenses to protect against an emp attack
1255754 nuclear missiles dont discriminate on party lines when they land
1255755 senator obama has been quoted as saying i dont agree with a missile defense system and that we can cut 10 billion of the research out never mind as i say that the entire budget is 9 6 billion or 9 3 billion
1255756 needs a missile defense that is so strong in all the different phases we need to defend against that countries will decide its not worth coming up against us
1255757 thats one of the things that defeated the soviet union thats one of the ways we can deal with these rogue states and also the way that we can keep countries that are not enemies today but are potential enemies from developing capabilities to challenge us
1255758 on july 9 1994 workers world party chairperson sam marcy sent the following statement to comrade kim jong il the central committee of the workers party of korea and the state funeral committee of president kim il sung
1255759 dear comrade kim jong il the national committee of workers world party extends our deepest condolences on the passing of the great leader of the korean people comrade president kim il sung comrade kim il sung devoted his whole life to the korean peoples struggle for national self determination and the international working class struggle for socialist emancipation with his leadership the korean people defeated the japanese colonial occupation and soon after brought about the first defeat of the u s imperialist military machine for over 40 years since the armistice the u s military has continued to occupy the south of korea with troops and nuclear weapons this occupation has been the chief obstacle to peaceful reunification of korea and poses the chief danger of a new war on the peninsula
1255760 workers world party values our close comradely relations with the workers party of korea very highly we are proud to have known kim il sung as a great leader and a comrade in the international communist movement

1255773 the fdas regulatory decisions affect the health of millions of americans and we dont make those decisions in a vacuum
1255774 its imperative that we seek advice from independent experts and that we do so in a way that is public open and transparent todays announcement strengthens our processes
1255775 the board met this monday morning and we are still waiting for the icc to send their task force to pakistan to discuss the security arrangements there
1255776 we are just awaiting those reports and we will confirm our arrangements to pakistan as soon as possible within probably seven to ten days
1255777 before taking any decision on the tournament everybody would want to make sure that they have maximum number of pieces of information in hand and that everything is safe and secure for our players
1255778 the squad is made up of the players who have done well for us over the past year and we have every confidence that they will regain the no 1 ranking from australia
1255779 the only player who is no longer part of the mix is charl langeveldt who is no longer available
1255780 we have included hashim amla as the 15th player in the squad because of the heavy workload that graeme smith has had to carry and the injuries he has suffered recently
1255781 hashim played in our most recent odi series against bangladesh and he will provide the cover in the opening batting area
1255782 including the warm up matches there are nine matches to be played in the limited overs section of the tour and the selection of an additional player is more than justified
1255783 the proteas first test series win in england since unity in 1991 is a fantastic achievement and one that has made the whole country immensely proud
1255784 we hope now that graeme smith and his players can finish off the test series at the oval with another high quality performance before turning their attention to twenty20 and odi cricket
1255785 children in far more than half the households in this country will grow up without ever having seen andrew flintoff or any other england cricketer perform live and so uncool is it to watch highlights that fewer than a million watch those on channel 5 how can any sport prosper when its role models perform in purdah no doubt the ecb will blame the bbc for not making a substantial bid but the games authorities should negotiate the best bid not the biggest

1255812 kevin has got to play the way he wants to play look at his stats he is better than anyone in the side so why would you change let him go and do his thing
1255813 he is a fine player he has got confidence by the bucketload and he will probably take that into his captaincy the one thing we dont want is for him to change
1255814 he goes out to bat and will bat left handed switch shots and all those things but he doesnt just think about it on the spot you watch him practice in the nets
1255815 for the 2006 ashes series in australia he worked so hard at dealing with the short ball he works so hard on his fitness as well quite a lot of thought goes into the way he plays
1255816 he averages 50 odd with the bat in both forms of the game and he is an unbelievable talent
1255817 everyone will ask will his batting be affected but knowing kevin he will probably average 70 as captain
1255818 i enjoyed playing under michael he got the best out of his team he got the best out of me when he took over from nasser hussain there was a definite mood shift even in the week he took over
1255819 michael is relaxed and wanted people to express themselves and have fun playing and i think we did that for a long time it is sad that he has gone
1255820 it is massive boots to fill but i am sure kevin will be confident he can he is very single minded and talented i am sure he will be relishing it now
1255821 i dont think he will be thinking of the boots hes got to fill he will have a plan of what he has to do and how he wants to go about it

1255867 our family is aware there is a lot of speculation and conjecture about her situation within the community
1255868 i do not wish to go any further into the circumstances leading up to or surrounding her hospital admission
1255869 to do so publicly at this point is not in paulas best interests
1255870 there has been speculation within the media that paulas hospitalisation is in some way related to comments by sam newman on
1255871 it was a shocking and brutal murder one can only imagine the pain and suffering her family has gone through

1255874 unless this is the first post youve read here youll know that i like windows vista not because i work for microsoft but on its own merits youll also know that im convinced that a lot not all but a lot of negative perception about vista is down to ignorance and problems of a bad press
1255875 they are correct in saying theres been a lot of bad publicity out there about vista
1255876 vista is a lot better than most people think it is particularly when you look at the product as it exists now with service pack 1 and everything else to it its actually not a bad platform for a lot of consumers and a lot of folks who have modern hardware it is a pretty good choice
1255877 although it is possible that in certain limited circumstances an image may allow identification of an individual it is clear that google are keen to capture images of streets and not individuals
1255878 the blurring of vehicle registration marks and the faces of anyone included in street view images
1255879 the data protection act is irrelevant to google unless people can be identified in the scenes
1255880 there will be some cases where the blurring technology misses a face but thats not a reason to shut down the service these people can complain to google if theyre upset by the image and they can have the photos removed if theyve suffered damage and distress as a consequence of the photographs they could sue

1255979 if he doesnt score runs at the moment england are well and truly out of just about any competition they need him doing that
1255980 when two captains are resigning and saying i need to just get back to playing cricket and worrying about scoring runs theres too much pressure captaining its probably not the most positive way to step into it
1255981 everyone has their different techniques and he inspires those around him just by his performance and his belief
1255982 theres going to be a lot of pressure on him now i must admit i wouldve let kevin keep being the number one batsman but who do you give it to in that group
1255983 there are a lot of young players and its a bit of a bombshell
1255984 hes very much like warne hell be very aggressive and hell be looking to always take control and be in command of everything that he is doing
1255985 hes that sort of strong personality theres no doubt about that
1255986 i havent played enough cricket in and around kevin pietersen to know whether he has got the nous the ability and skills of shane warne when it comes to captaincy
1255987 i have no doubts about my captaincy ability absolutely none but i am not scoring runs
1255988 placing england permanently behind the eight ball in an unsustainable win lose matrix going forward
1255989 you try to find a system whereby you help the players to have the freedom to play
1255990 it is important to have a mature captain especially when you are developing as a team we have had quite a lot of changes in both test and one day teams and we have an inexperienced set of bowlers so to have somebody like michael to marshal them and give his experience is very important
1255991 i respect michaels decision to have a few weeks off
1255992 i believe he is still a fantastic batter one of the best batters weve got in this country
1255993 michael says he wants to score runs for yorkshire and hell go back into county cricket without any stresses or strains and hell score as many runs as he can and im sure michael will be back in this england team
1255994 they are huge boots ive got to try and fill but ill give it the best possible i can give it
1255995 ill always respect the job michael has done and the jobs my predecessors have done and i will always look for advice i am fresh into this captaincy and ill need some advice and help along the way
1255996 i spoke to michael at great lengths and one of the most exciting things is that ive had text messages and phone calls from the senior players in the squad
1255997 they basically said were right behind you and well support you once youve got the support from the lads around you who youre with all the time theres nothing more you can ask for
1255998 we did discuss his batting but it was a short discussion because we know what his capabilities are
1255999 i dont see theres going to be any problem whatsoever i know what hes capable of doing and if he takes to captaincy like hes taken to batting i dont for see any problem whatsoever

1256002 i dont think i would be sitting here today if i wasnt 100 confident that everything is going to be perfectly fine
1256003 he moores likes to challenge us he likes to challenge us on a daily basis there are a lot of strong characters and opinionated people in the dressing room and i think yesterday i sat down with peter and we had a really good discussion on how we want to take this team forward
1256004 my position as a player to becoming captain is now totally different and we need to unite and get onto the same hymn sheet and we need to get this team going forward
1256005 he likes to challenge players but the crux of yesterdays meeting was to determine and decipher where peter and myself can take this england team
1256006 i hope it wont restrict the way i play and i think it will be silly for me to start thinking it definitely will affect the way i play
1256007 i play the way i play and its a way that ive been successful with so far in my career and its something i want to try and keep at a really high level
1256008 i want the team to play similarly to the way i play my game although you have to be accountable for the things you do and be responsible for the decisions you make
1256009 ive learnt a lot from michael from the way he has been around the team and the way hes spoken to players the way he commands himself
1256010 i will always ask for advice i will also be listening ill always ask questions i will always take advice from people its exciting for me its something that is a brand new test a brand new challenge and i love challenges
1256011 i just see this as a fantastic opportunity to grab with both hands and to go with it and run with it
1256012 if it doesnt work and it affects a few things in terms of my personal life or if affects the way that i bat then i will be man enough to say so
1256013 im not going to be a wimp and say im not going to do it im not going to take it on board and im going to give it a really good go like i give everything in my life a good go
1256014 ive just recently got married to liberty x singer jessica taylor and if you look at what michael said about the last nine months and what hes been like at home its interesting to hear

1256016 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1256017 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1256018 it is the simplest but it is the least reproducible
1256019 to me it all indicates that the person experimented with the ways to dry the spores and produced small batches some of them not so successfully he later used to fill up different envelopes
1256020 the spores are naturally clumpy as i understand he just over baked the first batches
1256021 if they had real evidence on him why did they not just arrest him
1256022 the investigators looked around they decided they had to find somebody they went after all of them but he looked the most susceptible to pressure
1256023 it is like prisoners of war if they are harassed enough they will be driven to do anything but i dont believe he would have done what they say he did

1256108 it helps with the suppression of fires the drier it is its easier for the fire to spread but with the humidity its easier to slow cause theres moisture in the air but along with the humidity we have the possibility of lightning
1256109 the only other things we had were a boxing club and a tennis club and they werent interested
1256110 then i thought that we have a fine river here and maybe i could use that
1256111 i remember jim byrne senior came up to have a look one day and he said it would never work and in a way he was right because when i finally launched it in the river it would capsize all the time
1256112 eventually i realised this and put the seat low in the boat and it worked fine
1256113 we had great times with crowds lining the bank we got 6d a head from them going in the gate
1256114 the cloth was ticking used for covering mattresses with a couple of good coats of oil splashed on it
1256115 one early club member was jock kelly who worked on the curragh and was a very good canoeist hed come along in the evenings with a couple of lads and they had their own boat which was called katy daly after a popular song from the time
1256116 i decided to try and make one in fibreglass i knew what i wanted i knew i had the ability but the material was the problem so i went to thompsons in carlow who were making pleasure boats for the american market from fibreglass and they agreed to supply me
1256117 it was very successful in its own way but unfortunately i had to go back to work or leave my family hungry
1256118 i built a hovercraft i used a lawnmower engine for power and a balloon underpinning i remember one day i took it across to the curragh and while i was driving it on the grass around ballymany a military jeep came up alongside me and pulled me over these mps with guns pointed surrounded me very curious about this strange vehicle on their territory
1256119 to get away from them i drove it into the water at the square and travelled on up the river
1256120 it is amazing and with the floating dock it is state of art

1256126 we wanted to solve the problem search engine users are experiencing with existing services that is the massive volume of search results they must sift through online
1256127 weve addressed the problem with a comfortable and familiar search experience that improves upon the shortcomings of first generation search engines connecting experienced guides with those searching for information in real time is a powerful thing and brings a whole new dimension to internet searching
1256128 chacha merges the best elements from social and traditional search methods to create a meaningfully different search experience

1256134 i offer my proposal to anybody who is dean kerry lieberman george w bush anybody make it part of your platform a minimum four weeks paid vacation for every working man and woman in america youll be elected in a flash
1256135 in europe theres this whole notion that vacation is an investment for employees so that they stay healthy
1256136 the left in europe was growing and looked to the soviet union for answers
1256137 by the mid to late 1930s paid vacations were common in western europe
1256138 in europe theres this whole notion that vacation is an investment for employees so that they stay healthy
1256139 the swedish vacation is being adapted to the international situation
1256140 the classic five week vacation is not as holy as it used to be
1256141 with a modern just in time production system you cant just close a factory for a month
1256142 in this area there has been a big shift in sweden
1256143 when people realize the effect that not working has on their pensions on health care and on consumption especially compared with other countries i have no doubt they will work more
1256144 when you pick a cat up by the tail you learn something you can learn no other way
1256145 moskau ist sehr besorgt ber die eskalation der spannungen in der region die auf eine unverh ltnism ige anwendung von gewalt auf georgischer seite zur ckzuf hren ist
1256146 it is imperative that texas officials stay the execution of jos medellin not only because of the pending world court decision but also to take into account recent congressional action on this issue
1256147 even president bush who signed scores of death warrants as texas governor concurred some time ago that the united states must honor its international obligations in this case there will be no clearer sign that texas will have gone beyond the pale than if jos medellins execution goes forward
1256148 flouting the world court ruling would be yet another blight on americas already tarnished international reputation
1256149 texas has a responsibility to respect u s commitments particularly those which also serve to protect american citizens abroad and in an era of increasing distrust over the united states ability to use its power fairly and wisely governor perry should seriously consider whether he wants his actions to further strain u s relationships with important allies
1256150 despite countless claims by the government of myanmar that it is moving toward allowing broader political participation u win tin was detained not long after the 1988 demonstrations and remains in prison along with thousands of others
1256151 nothing speaks louder of the governments poor faith than the fact that there are more long standing political prisoners in myanmar now than at any other time since those protests
1256152 while u win tin is the longest serving prisoner of conscience in myanmar he is far from alone
1256153 he has been joined by thousands of others since 1988 roughly 900 in just the past ten months the un should no longer accept the governments hollow assurances but hold myanmar firmly to its word
1256154 everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea

1256163 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1256164 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1256165 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1256166 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over
1256167 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1256168 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1256169 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1256170 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

1256200 the people who run this tournament organize it well they run it smoothly and everyone knows where they need to be but its a pretty big meet everyone knows everyone here this is the westchester swimming world
1256201 its the first race so you are not that tired theres only the finals so you know that you have to go for it
1256202 its an honor to win here i wasnt even in the top heat
1256203 i went all out and i am really happy with how i did
1256204 it was very exciting i have never done anything like this
1256205 it was more nerve racking because there normally is not everyone standing up and staring at you
1256206 i didnt swim that well earlier so its good to finish off like this
1256207 finals swimming nothing compares to it i wouldnt have done if it wasnt for my friend alex gianino he pushed me to do better
1256208 while we still have a considerable portion of our season in front of us i am encouraged by the results especially in the current economic climate

1256210 one thing i miss about high school is not getting to touch the ball as much when im returning kicks i want to make the most out of every chance i get its motivation to take advantage of what i get
1256211 i feel its another chance to make big plays i havent had to do it yet field punts with defenders coming down but im getting good experience
1256212 the coaches trust me they feel i can make big plays and take care of the ball
1256213 hes such a hard worker a natural punt catcher and he makes great decisions
1256214 we probably have four guys who can return the ball this year ferguson moturi transfer dustin bell and evan davis thats four guys when last year we had one or two were deeper there than we were last season to this season is night and day with our depth
1256215 i dont see why i wouldnt be back there i havent done it much yet but in high school i was pretty good at it

1256226 it was obviously a big disappointment not to reach orbit on this flight
1256227 this is under investigation and i will send out a note as soon as we understand exactly what happened

1256231 they did okay as most of the theme parks did in lieu of vacation and better than a stay cation suburbanites will take their kids to an amusement park and thats what they did in the second quarter
1256232 they made up the attendance drop on the bottom line in two ways
1256233 spending per guest was up slightly which means they charged more for parking and food and beverage and they restructured and cut costs and that was another big factor
1256234 while we still have a considerable portion of our season in front of us im encouraged by the results especially in the current economic climate

1256239 do you know that the pharisees took offense when they heard what you said

1256243 a momentous economic slowdown is now under way we believe the deterioration in spain is just in the beginning stages the bulk of the pain will be suffered in 2009
1256244 the probability of a crisis scenario similar to the early 1990s is increasing if the erm exchange rate mechanism scenario were to become reality the main concern would not be earnings but capital
1256245 we estimate that a non performing loan ratio of 10pc to 15pc for developers loans would fully erase earnings in 2009 and would represent between 20pc to 30pc of the current tangible capital base of banco popular sabadell and banesto

1256269 dan mereka tidak mengagungkan alloh dengan pengagungan yang semestinya padahal bumi seluruhnya dalam genggaman nya pada hari kiamat dan langit digulung dengan tangan kanan nya maha suci dan maha tinggi dia dari apa yang mereka persekutukan
1256270 alloh menggenggam bumi dan melipat langit dengan tangan kanan nya kemudian berfirman

1256276 the whole regions transport network must establish a dense atmosphere of secure transport and production
1256277 we cant rule out that this was the work of a few east turkestan supporters within the country who have links to external terrorist forces
1256278 east turkestan terrorist forces are the most direct and most real terror threat to the beijing olympic games
1256279 but we do know the crackdown in xinjiang especially ahead of the olympics has increased discontent among uighurs
1256280 the general mood is fear official intimidation a police state fear

1256291 i want to inspire a renewal of morality in politics
1256292 are you trying to tell me that a pair of partners at home are not going to discuss elements of the employment at work
1256293 there are currently more than 100 secrecy and confidentiality provisions in commonwealth legislation
1256294 the interaction of these provisions with one another and with other legislation is overly complex
1256295 i have asked the australian law reform commission to develop options for ensuring a consistent approach across government to the protection of commonwealth information
1256296 smile in your face all the time they wanna take your place

1256298 this is now a civil matter for the property owner and the contractors who delivered the rock to the shoreline to find a resolution which includes examining each and every rock for potential remaining unexploded ordinance
1256299 will not pay to remove the stone or take responsibility
1256300 we have been at an impasse for over a week
1256301 recycling broken concrete and rock from highway street bridge and building projects saves precious landfill space reduces truck traffic lowers fuel consumption and provides less expensive quality materials for new construction
1256302 to our knowledge the epa coast guard and the state fire marshals office are working to draft a plan of action
1256303 the county will continue to work with state and federal agencies
1256304 but it wasnt the captain that sank the titanic a ship they claimed was unsinkable it was the iceberg

1256306 the second patient treated at the scene was a woman believed to be in her seventies she was given pain relief for multiple fractures and transported to the royal melbourne hospital
1256307 mr rudd and mr swan between them over eight months have destroyed business and consumer confidence in the australian economy
1256308 they talked up inflation as being a crisis they delivered higher taxes in the budget and now weve seen petrol and grocery prices increase
1256309 that was always mr rudds plan to slow the economy
1256310 no and i hope paula wreidt given the time to recover her health i believe she has an ongoing and a lot to offer in a career in politics in the future
1256311 this is what the government said we would do before the election
1256312 we said we would bring forward water purchasing and thats what were doing
1256313 so we are simply rolling out the water purchase program as we were elected to do and as we committed to do prior to the election
1256314 we actually purchased high security water as well as general security and low security water so we did purchase high security water in the murray
1256315 we assessed the offers put to us by sellers on the basis of value for money which included an assessment of how environmentally valuable they would be so well approach this new purchase in the same way
1256316 you read the hqcc health quality and complaints commission report and its almost a complete replication of what happened in bundaberg
1256317 you cant fix a system overnight but we have a five year plan and it is on track
1256318 we have increased the number of doctors and nurses and the complaint system is now one of the toughest in the country and with mandatory reporting it will be even tougher
1256319 the other issue that i take issue with is this continual bureaucrat bashing that goes on
1256320 i wish i was in the mosh pit wtf it wasnt full
1256321 panic at the disco are a bunch of super uber fr
1256322 usually what you find is the first one works well
1256323 the second one works ok the third one doesnt work very well and after that youre wasting your time and money
1256324 any time you get a penalty especially tacked onto a long run like that it hurts
1256325 i know i told coach john hufnagel this morning that i feel like i hurt the team i take that all on me it was a dumb mistake
1256326 it all depends on what degree of improvement youre talking about
1256327 are we leading the league in penalties no the stamps are the third most penalized team in the league and have taken the second most penalty yardage are we under the rate they had last year yes are we taking more penalties than i want yes
1256328 our players have to sometimes separate over aggressiveness and playing smart thats a fine line between controlling aggressiveness and ruining the players ability to play the game
1256329 we need to get more pressure we did get some tipped balls against saskatchewan but we did not get the quarterback on the ground and thats a disappointment
1256330 its easier said than done obviously we brought more than three and four guys and they did a nice job of reading it and marcus crandell is a smart quarterback and he got rid of the football but we always stress the importance of making the quarterback nervous and creating some havoc
1256331 hopefully she can hold it off until at least friday

1256414 were very strict were probably the strictest among the web sites we dont encourage racy bikini content on our web site

1256458 and learn we will the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year

1256532 but we wanted to make sure because hes got a good opportunity to go up there to the seattle ballclub later in the year and hopefully make the club out of spring training and make that rotation
1256533 but hes a year older now and hes been outstanding all year

1256535 let me say this ive never been more nervous on the field in my life
1256536 growing up in texas you see those kinds of storms all the time you learn that lightning is nothing to fool around with
1256537 ill stand out there in the rainstorm all day long but thunder and lightning in that kind of proximity its definitely a hazard you have to get the fans out of there we have to be out there but if you give those fans a reason to hang around they will
1256538 when the last one hit it was too close even for us and i pulled them off i would never put any team or player or umpire in harms way
1256539 if you want to save a visit from me all you need to do is pour half a cup of bleach down your drain every month or two
1256540 this game shows that were capable of a lot more than weve shown this season obviously
1256541 it had to have been pretty frustrating because they made an honest effort to really go out and put a team on the field that was going to be bingo bango
1256542 i was thinking smaller stay to the big part of the field and dont try to do too much
1256543 the likelihood of doing that another grand slam was not too great
1256544 we have been and will continue to monitor how he rowland smith is doing
1256545 we want to get him up here but we have no timetable on it
1256546 i really dont know how close any of that came
1256547 i know we value him so much it was going to be a high price to lose raul or a lot of guys
1256548 my wife is seven months pregnant she was thinking about it a lot more than me
1256549 you just change uniforms and play she was definitely relieved
1256550 he called me that day and said daddy we didnt get traded
1256551 i probably got ahead of myself in talking about that because i dont know when were going to do that
1256552 weve got to be really clear in our minds and his mind as to whats the best process
1256553 basically there needs to be a plan put in place it might be soon but it might not be as soon as i was alluding to the other day
1256554 i should read this to see if it is appropriate for luca
1256555 do not go up and put his binky in his mouth do not go up and put his binky in his mouth dont do it dont

1256564 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1256565 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1256566 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1256567 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1256568 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1256569 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1256570 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1256571 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1256572 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1256573 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1256574 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1256575 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1256576 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1256577 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1256578 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1256579 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1256580 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1256581 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1256582 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1256583 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1256584 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1256585 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1256586 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1256587 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1256588 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1256589 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1256590 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1256591 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1256592 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1256593 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1256594 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

1256602 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1256603 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1256604 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1256605 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1256606 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1256607 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1256608 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1256609 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america

1256611 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1256612 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

1256615 the bars and the floor are my two strongest events so im going to concentrate on them
1256616 my main aim is to help the team qualify for the team final
1256617 obviously the doctors and physios are keeping a close eye on me and my personal coach is just making sure everything is staying in place
1256618 i havent changed my training preparation since ive come here ive just kept with what i was doing at home im happy with how its progressing and hopefully ill be fully fit
1256619 a medal of any colour would be the icing on the cake for me
1256620 thats my ultimate goal but if i dont achieve that i wont look back and regret it over my whole career
1256621 anything is possible all the teams are so close its all about what we can do on the day weve got good depth and strength in our team
1256622 id love to go to a home games i did the commonwealths in manchester but i think my body is going to be too old for 2012
1256623 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1256624 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1256625 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1256626 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1256627 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1256628 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1256629 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1256630 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1256631 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1256632 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1256633 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1256634 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1256635 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1256636 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1256637 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1256638 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1256639 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1256640 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1256641 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1256642 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1256643 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1256644 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1256645 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1256646 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1256647 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1256648 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1256649 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1256650 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1256651 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1256652 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1256653 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1256654 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1256655 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1256656 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1256657 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1256658 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1256659 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1256660 who are open to doing something on the production side
1256661 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1256662 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1256663 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1256664 the one that you are looking for youre not gonna find her here
1256665 the one that you are looking for youre not gonna find her here here
1256666 the one that you are looking for youre not gonna find her here
1256667 the one that you are looking for youre not gonna find her here here
1256668 i call on senator obama to call on congress to come back into town and come back to work come off their vacation and address this energy challenge
1256669 we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
1256670 we simply cannot pretend as senator mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1256671 doubling of oil prices in the past year is a crisis for millions of americans
1256672 it is just a frank reality we have to do something
1256673 people have had to make some drastic changes in their own life so they are ready to see the government make some choices

1256708 at the moment the motivation of the british athletes is very high
1256709 i think 35 for britain would be good in comparison to athens where britain won 30 but they made a statement of 35 because surely they know they can hit 40 something
1256710 one of the reasons britain is so high is because of the number of gold medals in the last cycling world championships they won seven golds which probably will be impossible to repeat in beijing

1256736 were engaging in a conversation with our guests because we feel its important for them to know the truth about our food
1256737 it seems that almost every time i logged in to see the answers my readers are sending me to the how can i help you question it s like d j vu all over again
1256738 oh my god im going to get lucky how can i make it happen
1256739 oh my god im going to get lucky how do i not screw this up
1256740 entrepreneurs are entrepreneurial as differentiated from managerial or strategic because they think effectually they believe in a yet to be made future that can substantially be shaped by human action and they realize that to the extent that this human action can control the future they need not expend energies trying to predict it in fact to the extent that the future is shaped by human action it is not much use trying to predict it it is much more useful to understand and work with the people who are engaged in the decisions and actions that bring it into existence
1256741 at e3 this year midway showed that we have possibly our strongest holiday line up in recent years which we plan to kick off in september with tna impact a game that is garnering substantial buzz as a formidable competitor to other wrestling franchises following that we expect the releases of blitz the league ii and mortal kombat vs dc universe to expand the audience beyond their core fan bases
1256742 i dont care what people think of me because i am above that
1256743 the goal for our next project is something very different
1256744 story gameplay and peoples relationship with the game over the long term
1256745 i think for us we come out of our bioshock coma from shipping that game and how hard that was and then making a determination
1256746 whats next for us and how aggressive are we going to be
1256747 and we all looked at each other and these guys have worked together for maybe six or ten years all the senior creative guys on bioshock and asked what do we want to do
1256748 and we went to the company and said that and they said alright lets do that
1256749 weve had products like swat 4 which i had very little to do with that the guys executed exactly what that game should have been as far as im concerned but the goal there was to make a sequel to swat 3 to update that a very particular goal and they knocked that out of the park
1256750 the goal for our next project is something very very different so its a little scary because we dont know what it is exactly were getting a much clearer sense every single day in terms of what were doing deciding whats in and out of the game but its going to be aggressive
1256751 i actually cant talk about it without talking about the game itself
1256752 there are things related to story gameplay and i dont know how to describe it peoples relationship with the game over the long term thats what were thinking about but its about as clear as i can be
1256753 i could have you killed and my hands would be clean
1256754 the government has rushed in here with uncorroborated unsubstantiated allegations of a murder
1256755 if you look at this whole planet of ours the time window for which we have the earthquake data is so short in geological terms
1256756 the science of seismology has progressed quite a bit in the last 30 years i may not know what the next big earthquake is going to be but i can work on the structural side of it
1256757 brickbats do not the reason the historic angels flight railway is being restored and safely is because of the many supporters whose positive contributions are getting us close to finishing this big job
1256758 what were seeing here is a clear pattern of repeated violations of patient medical records and patient confidentiality by ucla
1256759 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues
1256760 ucla should have detected the violations by ms jackson years ago and should have immediately initiated the process to dismiss her
1256761 all other employees who were found to have violated patient confidentiality during our review have been disciplined including some who have been terminated
1256762 on behalf of the entire leadership of the ucla health system i am deeply sorry for this failure and the personal distress these breaches may have caused
1256763 californians have every right to expect their medical records to be safeguarded and protected and i am alarmed about repeated violations of patient confidentiality and the potential harm to the citizens of this state
1256764 by putting financial penalties in place for those employees and facilities that do not follow these laws this legislation will lead to better care for all californians
1256765 the bulk of them are designed to be at lunchtime so that people who work at these dmv locations can come out and join
1256766 traditional code enforcement did not make the same impact as lapds aggressive apprehension program
1256767 if we make some arrests and set some examples it will send a message that illegal dumping will not be tolerated

1256812 the digital era isnt just about making great websites or being great at photoshop
1256813 one must be able to work within that and many other mediums to broaden ones reach and market segments whats more
1256814 the buyers perception of images and the culture of the business has also taken an abrupt turn that isnt as accommodating to the traditional models as it once was
1256815 the market will probably be flat and were seeing some sectors in decline
1256816 im not involved in selling and in todays market im glad im not
1256817 in fact everything falls into that 10 per cent category there are probably 10 per cent more properties for people to view and it takes 10 per cent longer to find somebody to rent them
1256818 there are people whingeing and whining we havent felt it yet but the country seems to be talking itself into a recession
1256819 the religion and technology center is pleased to announce the availability in electronic form of mignes patrologi gr c long a classic this series of more than 160 volumes remains the most comprehensive record of greek patristic material in existence though many of the works covered in the series have been published more recently in various critical editions patrologi gr c remains the only published source for much of the material and the completeness of coverage is unsurpassed by other modern editions of similar material the electronic form of patrologi gr c electronic pg has been digitized in image format thus greatly reducing the cost while preserving the appearance of the original pages the tables of contents of patrologi gr c are notoriously vague and unhelpful so we have created completely new and comprehensive electronic tables of contents in our version although full text searching will not be possible with the images metadata searching including such items as patristic writers and titles of works in latin and english will be possible metadata searching is not yet available in our online sample below we plan to create a true full text xml version of patrologi gr c in the future and customers who buy the image version now will be entitled to an upgrade to the full text version for a price equal to the difference between the full text and image versions in other words there is no penalty for purchasing the image version early with our version of patrologi gr c there is no leasing of the data paying for the same content year after year users who purchase patrologi gr c will own their copy of it and libraries will be able to put it on servers for their students to use or they will be able to create cd roms of individual volumes for circulation through the library electronic patrologi gr c is available through online access via the web on an external hard disk or on a set of 16 dvds the base price of patrologi gr c for institutions is 3 000 plus the cost of delivery consortial pricing is available we offer special prices for individuals and for institutions outside north america and western europe for more details on pricing see below
1256820 also most companies do not prioritise their it departments and the companies therefore become less profitable and less competitive

1256838 yes actually i was wondering what we should research with our extra cash
1256839 well i think think that we should use that extra so called money to research a round thing that will make things much easier to move
1256840 it took you that long to come up with that round thing
1256841 well it was more complicated than that you see after we got the idea we had to start creating these tubes filled with green stuff and

1256872 parents who have a propensity for being verbally aggressive have a tendency to control their children during a play period
1256873 as a result these children were less cooperative and not only are parents setting up situations that are challenging for them to handle but they also are subtly undermining their childs self esteem
1256874 of course all parents direct their children and people in general are always directing others to close a door or hand them something
1256875 its something we do all the time but there is a qualitative difference in the kinds of directing going on by these verbally aggressive mothers
1256876 by looking at how and when directives occurred not just how often we found that moms who scored highest on verbal aggression used directives to control the child and ultimately the way the game or activity was played
1256877 it is a reactive compound its not usually considered an ingredient for life

1256882 the thing i hate is having a runner on third with less than two outs and not bringing him in
1256883 its an easy rbi but i put together some other good at bats
1256884 guys are beginning to pick it up after the break
1256885 we know theyre not going to hand us the division
1256886 all in all it was kind of ugly in the first inning im human i cant go out there and put up zeros inning after inning
1256887 once that starts happening there are some really good things on the horizon we know we can score we just let people score too many against us
1256888 his stuff was pretty good but maybe it wasnt the command we were used to seeing
1256889 i was trying to find a way to get on base
1256890 they were playing me way back at third base and that gave me the opportunity to get on
1256891 we were fortunate to get as many runs as we did off dan tonight
1256892 it doesnt happen often so when it does you hope you can shut the other team down
1256893 he was all over he was flirting with a lot of trouble every inning and just couldnt get anything going
1256894 we got nobody out in the bullpen just terrible pitches balls flying around everywhere
1256895 we have to have someone step up and make pitches not very much fun
1256896 lead follow or get the hell out of the way
1256897 i cant dwell on this ive got to get ready for my next outing hopefully the guys will pick me up
1256898 we know hes a fastball hitter and we throw him a fastball right down the middle
1256899 none of what they do is going to stop us from delivering our message
1256900 there is evidence that hatred of our religion was the motivation in part at least
1256901 they keep claiming that this property is theirs and it is not theirs
1256902 the fire was started by someone as we slept thankfully the lord our god sic keeps us in all our ways
1256903 my intensely awkward position is representative of the church at large
1256904 let us bite our liberal tongues for the sake of unity let us suffer the accusations of appeasing the homophobes for the sake of unity let us put our desire for an inclusive church on hold for the sake of unity let us be patient
1256905 we just dont want to have to deal with photographers in the future to re use photos we hired them to take in the first place
1256906 well well have to agree to disagree and while i respect your position as a businessperson to require this as the person who would be responsible for providing that content i just cant do that
1256907 its magic its wonderful the bunnies are back the legend is re born ive had a lot of adventures in my life but this truly is the cherry on top of the cake this is as good as it gets
1256908 it is a dream come true the feeling is euphoric as we recreate the classic cachet in the perfect town with the perfect partners for the next generation
1256909 pull the 2 strategically placed gold ribbons and she becomes nude
1256910 the rabbit logo has to be the most recognizable of any in the world this is our 1 million salute 30ft high and just over 2 stories on the 24th and 25th floors so it can be seen from the strip the i 15 and up to a mile away its an electronic led so we can have any color and any image we want on it we selected video from the early days of playboy for the inside screen to make it very special and unique we have resurrected the brand for the 21st century and i believe everybody will accept it and embrace it because the tv show has helped tremendously and a whole new generationhas become fascinated with the playboy image that christy has reborn in a new direction plus we have the most gorgeous girls in the world in their new roberto cavalli uniforms complete with trademark fluffy rabbit tails and ears as our playboy dealers and cocktail servers and when i gave him the tour of his very own sky villa he stopped took a moment and said this is a very special time for me he was in tears absolutely blown away by what he saw
1256911 to recreate the classic cache of the playboy clubs in the perfect town with the perfect partners for the next generation is a dream come true when people see these venues they will be blown away this is the coolest party in town i was the person who had the sad task of closing the very last club 20 years ago and now im the happiest person re opening a brand new one its a euphoric feeling today though we are very different from the past its very important to remember we are not a standalone nightclub here but an integrated entertainment experience with dancing in moon drinking and dining in nove and entertainment and gaming in the playboy club so people will experience the brand in 3 different kinds of ways its the next generation of what a nightclub should be no nightclubs were ever more successful than playboy clubs for the number of years they were open they had the best entertainment the coolest guests and the greatest food all those years ago today though its impossible to book entertainment in such small clubs so thats why gaming became the important element what weve all done here in vegas will now be duplicated in london macau where the brand can come back to life in the same multi dimensional way this is the perfect town with the perfect partners and a family tradition continues
1256912 it is everything we wanted we kept asking hef if he was happy with what hesaw he said it was even more than we had promised he had tears in his eyes saying he was blown away and he just kept on hugging us we wanted to deliver more than beyond his wildest imagination we wanted his validation and he said we did it this is the first time ever that gaming and lounging have been integrated we wanted luxury and exclusivity without snobbery and this just smells of money
1256913 we are very happy with the girls we found as dealers and servers to represent playboy vegas
1256914 i agree that las vegas has always been considered los angeless playground and in reality the playboy mansion has always been considered a playground for the well to do and the important people in la so i think this will be the same just a little further east
1256915 this is a very exciting and memorable weekend for all of us
1256916 they were then picked up by army helicopter from base camp this morning and have now been shifted to hospital for treatment for severe frostbite
1256917 he confessed that he committed the crime because he had copied it from the game he played
1256918 the thoughts of all the staff who were involved in bens care are with his family at this very sad time
1256919 castle and rodgers have lived the high life for many years living off the proceeds of crime
1256920 it was an initiative by those on the presidential staff who look after berlusconis image
1256921 that breast that nipple it ends up exactly inside the frame captured by tv news stations at press conferences
1256922 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics
1256923 we want people to use these techniques daily in their work using broad insights learning faster failing faster design thinking can be applied everywhere every day
1256924 once business leaders see they can use design thinking to reframe problems they are transformed
1256925 the analytical process we typically use to do our work understand the problem and alternatives develop several ideas and do a final external check with the customer gets flipped instead design thinking methods instruct theres an opportunity somewhere in this neighborhood use a broader consumer context to inform the opportunity brainstorm a large quantity of fresh ideas and co create and iterate using low resolution prototypes with that consumer
1256926 business schools tend to focus on inductive thinking based on directly observable facts and deductive thinking logic and analysis typically based on past evidence
1256927 design schools emphasize abductive thinking imagining what could be possible this new thinking approach helps us challenge assumed constraints and add to ideas versus discouraging them
1256928 the most important result is that people are finding the right solutions and sticking with them they describe increased satisfaction and a better experience as a result we are seeing an increase in our equity scores and better loyalty to the brand
1256929 how do we teach people what design thinking is and how to use it in a way that it could scale across a company with 130 000 employees how could we engage more functions within the organization
1256930 if we could get this right then the prospect of fulfilling a g lafleys vision had hope
1256931 somehow it didnt quite deliver people didnt take action the lessons didnt have staying power
1256932 there was too much academic stuff philosophy and theory of design we got rid of all the theory and settled on a completely experiential approach to effect a major transformation in the way a problem is viewed through design thinking the team must engage completely
1256933 our business people wanted to get on with it we will always engage when working on a problem in our business but not necessarily engage when working on theoretical problems from then on we were very selective to find worthy problems and assemble the right types of stimuli to get to the crux of the matter
1256934 most of our workshop reflections suggest that the power of doing design thinking rather than just reacting to design thinking shifted many standoffish leaders into real partners for design once they get it they cant get enough of it
1256935 participants get scared using such rough prototypes to elicit consumer feedback at the beginning but they are won over when they see the benefits of co creation
1256936 we have found that the more finished a prototype is the less feedback people will give you when you give prospective users something half finished they think you dont know the answer they know you need their help and really open up
1256937 i get goose bumps at the high level of dialogue and caliber of discussion that happens design thinking activates both sides of the brain it makes participants more creative more empathetic toward the human condition p amp g consumers face our managers dont leave their analytical minds at home instead they are able to operate with their whole brain not just the left hemisphere
1256938 design is going to continue to grow and prosper at p amp g that was my goal when i took this position our senior leaders are really engaged in design now we have amazing global design talent and design thinking gets all the other disciplines engaged we have a wait list of people from every function in the company that want to become facilitators in design thinking
1256939 intentional constant and systematic attempts are being made to erode the achievements of the kemalist ataturk revolution turning religion into an ideology will politicise it and religion will then be the biggest loser
1256940 the military is the sole appointed guardian of the foundation of the turkish republic so they will be allergic to any kind of islamism
1256941 but after what we have just passed through he will be much more cautious than buyukanit
1256942 most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1256943 the gas prices that are wiping out your pay cheques and straining businesses to the jobs that are disappearing from this state
1256944 it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1256945 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1256946 we should sell 70m barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks
1256947 negative emotions and tensions between the new eu immigrants and local communities
1256948 the newspaper wishes to make clear that it wasnt in any way anti polish
1256949 we are pleased that the daily mail could see that some of the wording they had in their headlines was harmful and they have taken far more care
1256950 we are sending out requests to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games
1256951 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
1256952 we were astonished we had to move it that took of course many many hours some turned back because they did not trust it anymore
1256953 the democratic led congress appears intent on using its oversight powers to investigate the bush administration until the day the latter packs up and walks out of the white house oversight hearings and reports have been as common as lobbyists on capitol hill since the democrats swept the 2006 elections in july alone hearings covered a range of subjects including allegations of faulty wiring installed by us contractors in iraq possibly misleading testimony from environmental protection agency epa administrator stephen johnson and charges that politics guided hiring of career workers in the justice department
1256954 senator mccain and the republicans in congress are calling senator obama and the democrats environmental wimps for refusing to allow the oil industry to drill in the arctic national wildlife refuge environmentally sensitive offshore areas and anywhere else they please the republicans are claiming that the democrats dont care about joe sixpack who now has to pay 4 a gallon for his gas nor do they care that most of this oil is now imported
1256955 beer in my hand sunny day in the office whats wrong with this picture
1256956 edmond is 85 doubtful and the big much winner felix is out
1256957 we only expressed our intention to terminate because we did not send out a termination letter
1256958 i dont remember signing anything like that so i am not aware of the details but i will have to speak to the secretary general and then i will be in a better position to talk about it
1256959 we have decided that termination is the best option and that decision was reached after the fulfillment of the 30 day notice that is stipulated in the agreement
1256960 we have the utmost regard for the person of dr mike adenuga jnr and indeed a number of top officials of globacom but we have reached tethers end on the relationship and there is no going back
1256961 there is no doubt that we had issues in the past two years over fulfillment of contract terms and the rest but we still respect the companys chieftains and we wish them and the establishment great luck in all their future endeavours and relationships
1256962 we have prosecuted our programmes and events heartily and happily for seven months of the year without globacoms money we will continue to do so without the companys money until we secure new partners
1256963 the purported termination of our sponsorship contract was a most unusual and surprising development considering that the company had all along fulfilled all aspects of its obligation under the contract in addition to committing huge resources and goodwill to the development and promotion of football in nigeria
1256964 we chose not to join issues as those statements were credited to junior officers of the federation who may not have been availed of the full details of the contract and because we at globacom believe that the bigger interest of nigerian football rates higher than any individual considerations more so as we had not received any such letter of termination
1256965 globacom had in the last few months quietly pursued a peaceful resolution of observed breaches in the implementation of the contract by the nff
1256966 by and large the list underscores nigerias desire to try new options against the backdrop of the super eagles having already picked a ticket for the third and final phase of qualifying which begins in march 2009
1256967 it is so difficult for serugo he needs sparring sessions to know how to keep his distance and also defend himself
1256968 i am sure i will get help from the cubans they are never scared of giving out their boxers for training
1256969 wij staan k voor de revitalisering van woonwijken en katendrecht kan wel een oppepper gebruiken het schip levert minimaal 475 arbeidsplaatsen en stageplekken op de rotterdam heeft bovendien een uitstraling naar de hele stad het schip wordt een geweldige attractie al die dingen bij elkaar opgeteld is dit een goede investering
1256970 het is heel spannend geweest ja maar alles ziet er nu goed uit we zouden het z opnieuw doen
1256971 we waren goed vertrokken maar kwamen al snel niet verder twee duikers hebben toen de onderkant van het schip ge nspecteerd en zagen dat er illegaal vistuig in de motor terecht was gekomen toen ze dat wilden verwijderen zagen ze dat er veel meer rotzooi zat
1256972 vrijdag hebben we een bruiloft maar het is de vraag of het schip dan weer inzetbaar is
1256973 ondanks het feit dat de gemeente er in april heeft gebaggerd ligt er nog ontzettend veel rommel
1256974 je begrijpt dus dat we de toekomst van ons bedrijf daar niet voor op het spel gaan zetten de schade is nu waarschijnlijk al vele malen groter dan de opbrengst van de afgelopen vijf weken
1256975 ik ben verrast door de nieuwe problemen die de schipper ondervindt
1256976 we moeten zijn keuze respecteren maar het is natuurlijk ontzettend jammer dat de veerdienst nu verdwijnt
1256977 dat is het vervelende aan deze locatie door de dijk de bomen en de huizen staat er het ene moment geen wind en het andere juist een hele felle dat is erg lastig zeker voor cursisten die nog helemaal geen ervaring hebben
1256978 ik heb me erbij neergelegd hier is het ook niet verkeerd maar als ik moet kiezen kies ik toch voor de speelmansplaten daar zaten we veel vrijer het was gemakkelijker om alle cursisten in de gaten te houden
1256979 dat werkt alleen maar makkelijker mocht zich een noodsituatie voordoen dan hoef je niet meer te zoeken naar de benodigde spullen om het te repareren
1256980 goed zeemanschap zorg ervoor dat je geen gevaar bent voor een ander maar zorg ook voor je eigen bemanning de beroepsvaart heeft altijd voorrang maar in de pleziervaart heeft een zeiljacht altijd voorrang op een motorboot
1256981 je bent de hele dag bezig maar tegelijk geeft het wel veel ontspanning

1256985 thorpes lawyer tony oreilly had informed the new south wales supreme court of this on monday and said that the proceedings would include a claim for infringement of privacy the statement said the court proceedings were adjourned until september 22 when it was expected that preparations would be made for a hearing some time next year the statement said adding that no further comment would be made
1256986 katherine did not seem to be interested in building on a successful piece of work but persistently dispersed herself in different styles and tones in her writing as in her life she revelled in change disguise mystery and mimicry the last she saw as the key to creation and understanding of character it gave her freedom but it also became a weakness lacking stamina she dispersed herself too widely in different effects

1256989 effectivement jai fait un petit malaise en direct sur le plateau je nallais vraiment pas bien et je nai pas pu continuer l mission
1256990 en fait jai pris b tement un coup de chaud sur ma terrasse et en me retrouvant sur le plateau sous la chaleur des projecteurs je ne me suis pas senti bien du tout
1256991 ik zal mijn verantwoordelijkheid nemen ik zal voorop gaan in de strijd de dragende spelers moeten het nu laten zien

1256996 both wrote clear books that made complicated and nuanced analyses seem almost obvious but only after their lucid formulations
1256997 consider the definition of a racketeer as someone who creates a threat and then charges for its reduction
1256998 forces readers to re examine everything from the way they talk to their children to the way they argue about politics
1256999 well now have a chance to catch up with our reading
1257000 my efforts to harmonize all three have always failed in one way or another
1257001 but the failures happily are usually of the kind from which one learns something useful
1257002 one way id like to improve social life is to get a guy to stop for five minutes or one minute or 10 seconds and listen to what the other guy says
1257003 the baby boomers were still sacrificing comfort for style then we finally discovered you can have both now i think everyone is on the same page designers and manufacturers are putting real scientific knowledge into their shoes in order to save the comfort
1257004 it doesnt have to be real but its doesnt also have to appear fake
1257005 its eco friendly and looks like snakeskin yet its strong enough to use to make shoes and handbags i defy most people to tell the difference between it and real snake skin its completely unbelievable
1257006 they tend to be far more realistic yes the high high heels are certainly here but thats more for dressing up and going out not necessarily your average shoe these vintage inspired styles really lend themselves to shorter comfortable heels
1257007 its going to take europe embracing this trend and mixing it with the technology the top of the shoe might be eco friendly but the bottom might not be
1257008 theres definitely a shift in that direction because it also makes the shoe lighter anything that makes a shoe light is good
1257009 we have music you can have a chat you have no troubles when you are dancing
1257010 live shackling is something that concerns us greatly but unfortunately it is a necessary process for water bath electrical stunning
1257011 we would like to see industry address this procedure more vigorously for example there are new plants being installed with lines that are too long and convoluted with too many bends before stunning
1257012 we are not happy with live shackling and would like to see it done away with over a number of years
1257013 we would like to see government and industry co operating to develop better methods
1257014 we have methods in use which we believe dont always give birds the right current as different birds can have a different electrical resistance there are also concerns over missed stuns and pre stun shocks
1257015 despite some drawbacks of this system there are great benefits as it avoids live shackling
1257016 we believe this is the way it should be done
1257017 its not black tie just a rock n roll downtown saturday night kind of party
1257018 someone needs a pair of tweezers and you run across the street to 7 eleven
1257019 if someone is going to whole foods for flowers we need to find out why
1257020 if its for an anniversary we will take it to the next level start setting up champagne and other amenities its an important day in their lives its paying attention to the little things
1257021 a woman who wants a certain kind of cosmetic in singapore when she gets there i can get on the phone
1257022 i wanted to be as accurate as possible within my artistic interpretation
1257023 if a tachyon shows up in an equation that suggests something is wrong
1257024 they might at least learn the names of the particles which may trigger their interest later in life
1257025 well how was i supposed to know that you were still here
1257026 in the present circumstances there is a possibility of misuse of these guns by the vdc members
1257027 we dont want to drive under a situation where our lives are under threat but two things force us to drive one is the social obligation and other the administrations pressure on the drivers that they would be denied salaries and promotions if they refuse to drive
1257028 it is our social obligation to ferry passengers this time
1257029 our employees are without salaries for the past five months
1257030 the management forces the drivers to drive the vehicles they want to appease their bosses by portraying that the fleet was running normally but ultimately they are putting the drivers to risk nobody is bothered about the welfare of the drivers
1257031 according to residents in the community the victims were involved in theft s in the area they have no criminal records here in our office maybe their derogatory mark is only at the barangay level for sure they have angered somebody
1257032 that is the official position of the milf that the moa is binding because it has been initialed by both parties
1257033 constituted a signature of the philippine government and the milf
1257034 the signing today tuesday is just a formality to show to announce to the world that there is a memorandum of agreement
1257035 its the same document kahit period hindi binago even the periods were not changed
1257036 the attacks were not the initiatives of local terrorists theyre part of the orchestrated moves instructed by the national npa command to demonstrate that they are still a force to reckon with
1257037 one or two communist guerillas hurling molotov bombs at communication towers even inside the town proper are acts of desperation they want to create the impression that they are still around
1257038 they are suffering from our relentless counterinsurgency operation this is their way of hitting us back
1257039 we are doing a lot of operation in bicol hitting the center of npa operations in sorsogon masbate and catanduanes provinces
1257040 for this period we are concentrating in one of the rebel affected areas in quezon as a a prelude to our final offensive next year
1257041 we maintain that there were no irregularities in the loan it was above board duly approved by the banks approving authorities including the board of directors
1257042 incumbent upon nograles then to sign the documents since he was in charge of the group in landbank that was arranging the loan
1257043 nograles is not a lawyer and thus it would be impossible for him to charge legal or notarial fees
1257044 nograles is highly regarded by the landbank management and board of directors at landbank he is known as an astute and highly competent senior executive
1257045 i appeal for calmness and tranquility theres nothing to be afraid because nothing is final yet
1257046 the moa is just a guideline and basis to proceed with the peace talks or final peace negotiation
1257047 the moa needs congressional approval and later will be subject ed to a plebiscite meaning it is just a piece of paper
1257048 there is no reason for any worry on the moa lets give peace a chance lets see the outcome of the peace agreement
1257049 if it is not good for us we will oppose in every step in congress and finally in the plebiscite let us support the moa and the postponement of the armm elections
1257050 not a single centavo has been released since about 10 years ago
1257051 air quality is directly related to health the incidence of respiratory ailments in metro manila is very high because of air pollution
1257052 per denr department of environment and natural resources general plan of action it is targeted that the ambient air quality value of 90ug ncm is attained or complied with by 2010
1257053 i bike behind smoke belching buses we dont hear people in edsa say mas maluwag ang pakiramdam ko ngayon i feel better today
1257054 we passed the clean air act in the 10th congress because of our concern for our children we may be raising children who may be retarded because of the quality of air few may become congressmen senators and presidents
1257055 already we are seeing parts of our cash operating expenses rising and third quarter demand softening slightly albeit the third quarter being a seasonally low period
1257056 we remain cautious and vigilant yet confident still that we will achieve our targets for 2008
1257057 what happened is too heinous alleged bribery and case grabbing there is no substitute perhaps to the high court hearing it first hand
1257058 with all due respect it would be preferable to assuage the pains and anxiety of the trial bar that the investigation of the court of appeals scandal be conducted by the supreme court itself or by a committee sitting justices
1257059 delegating the investigation to a panel of retired justices who in turn will submit their findings to the high court for review and determination is akin to a trial by commissioners
1257060 this temporary delay has disappointed all of us and at the supreme court we will present our case why we should continue with the signing of the memorandum agreement for ancestral domain which is within the law
1257061 we are confident eventually we should be able to return and have this memorandum on ancestral domain signed
1257062 we dont look at it as something perpetual the disappointment is felt not only by the milf rp government and friends of rp but also here in kuala lumpur
1257063 what should simmer in our minds is for peace and tranquility to exist there ought not to be violence in any instance
1257064 there was a strong recognition amongst ministers that these tough times in the global economy in fact increased the need for structural reform
1257065 in other words we should do structural reform because of global economic difficulties not despite global economic difficulties
1257066 theres been strong agreement over the past couple of days that there was no one size fits all model for reform
1257067 we are concerned that this could be used as an excuse for those who dont really want to reform and also that it could be used as an excuse for those who want to block reform
1257068 we are very encouraged by the fact that people got to the conclusion that those who did the reforms those who kept on the straight and narrow notwithstanding the difficulties are doing better and will do better
1257069 investors lent more weight to the drop in oil prices but that is not to say that the latest inflation data was completely ignored
1257070 mounting evidence of moderating economic growth is squeezing the speculative premia out of commodities
1257071 its too late for such a settlement offer we believe that this is better in order to teach him a lesson bukas ang kulungan para sa kanya jail is open for him
1257072 the present complaint against me is a form of harassment being committed against me by the complainant in the same way that his counter complaints against my daughter
1257073 the organization is very good but the pollution is no good
1257074 we stay in our bedrooms and the dining rooms not in the open
1257075 the people there do not recognize the borders they move in and out due to economic opportunities in sabah
1257076 this problem has a very long history and many observations have been made on illegal immigrants the people here know this crisis goes back to the 70s
1257077 i think the focus of those involved in illegal immigration during that time was to ensure there was a change in the demography of sabahs population
1257078 but of course today in the whole of sabah no matter what race or origin or religion the people are now worried over this perennial problem
1257079 the main problem is they do not have identification and without this they cannot go to school so many end up as child labor
1257080 many of these children fend for themselves they do not go to school and lay around in markets and restaurants and some sleep in the market area
1257081 there are drug lords here who smuggle syabu amphetamines and sell it in the city using their children most of them are armed so the locals stay away from these waters
1257082 they tap into our electricity and water supply their children are quick to learn the local language and mix soon it will be hard to tell them apart from a sabahan

1257119 says rachel walisko an 18 year old from vienna va
1257120 i feel like you can tell a lot about a person by the kind of music they listen to
1257121 some colleges feel it is important to make as good a match as possible other campuses feel college is a time to expand your horizons a little bit
1257122 some campuses purposely dont match two people from the same high school together others might put people like that together
1257123 philosophically we believe that one of the goals of living in residence halls is to learn to live with others
1257124 parents are sometimes more alarmed than students with the match
1257125 some parents admit they had filled out the form inaccurately but hoped that the positive influence would make their child into the fictional person who had filled out the form
1257126 this is live tv and unfortunately sometimes these things do happen
1257127 if i were 25 or 26 and getting married a bracelet necklace or matching earrings would be fine
1257128 giving them a bracelet isnt as special as spending an evening together plus as you get older everyone is more conscientious about their skin and appearance
1257129 giving them something for themselves as opposed to something that theyll never wear again is more meaningful
1257130 most women when they come in here they want it
1257131 it wasnt me saying hey we all could use a little something

1257135 we do a trial run of botox about four months ahead of time then two weeks before the wedding we do that last treatment
1257136 brides really appreciate the fact that we put everything in a regimented schedule for them
1257137 if you have to do eight treatments six weeks apart that could take up to a year
1257138 they will never choose botox over a great dress but they will say maybe ill have a buffet over a sit down at the rehearsal dinner
1257139 they asked the bride if they could use regular tanning cream from a salon

1257147 among those in which catholic traditions and institutions in part continue to exist the anglican communion occupies a special place
1257148 as the roman catholic church and the constituent churches of the anglican communion have sought to grow in mutual understanding and christian love they have come to recognize to value and to give thanks for a common faith in god our father in our lord jesus christ and in the holy spirit our common baptism into christ our sharing of the holy scriptures of the apostles and nicene creeds the chalcedonian definition and the teaching of the fathers our common christian inheritance for many centuries with its living traditions of liturgy theology spirituality and mission
1257149 to the achievement of points of convergence and even of agreement which many would not have thought possible before the commission began its work
1257150 as our dialogue has developed many catholics and anglicans have found in each other a love for christ which invites us into practical co operation and service this fellowship in the service of christ experienced by many of our communities around the world adds a further impetus to our relationship
1257151 the questions and problems of our friends are also our questions and problems
1257152 since this mississauga meeting however the churches of the anglican communion have entered into a period of dispute occasioned by the episcopal ordination of a person living in an openly acknowledged committed same sex relationship and the authorisation of public rites of blessing for same sex unions these matters have intensified reflection on the nature of the relationship between the churches of the communion in addition ecumenical relationships have become more complicated as proposals within the church of england have focussed attention on the issue of the ordination of women to the episcopate which is an established part of ministry in some anglican provinces
1257153 quam unitatem tenere firmiter et vindicare debemus maxime episcopi qui in ecclesia praesidimus ut episcopatum quoque ipsum unum atque indivisum probemus
1257154 episcopatus unus est cuius a singulis in solidum pars tenetur
1257155 united and held together by the glue of the mutual cohesion of the bishops
1257156 for the nurture and growth of this communion christ the lord has provided a ministry of oversight the fullness of which is entrusted to the episcopate which has the responsibility of maintaining and expressing the unity of the churches cf 33 amp 39 final report ministry and ordination by shepherding teaching and the celebration of the sacraments especially the eucharist this ministry holds believers together in the communion of the local church and in the wider communion of all the churches cf 39 this ministry of oversight has both collegial and primatial dimensions it is grounded in the life of the community and is open to the communitys participation in the discovery of gods will it is exercised so that unity and communion are expressed preserved and fostered at every level locally regionally and universally
1257157 intended to assure each community that its faith is indeed the apostolic faith received and transmitted from apostolic times
1257158 there are two dimensions to communion in the apostolic tradition diachronic and synchronic the process of tradition clearly entails the transmission of the gospel from one generation to another diachronic if the church is to remain united in the truth it must also entail the communion of the churches in all places in that one gospel synchronic both are necessary for the catholicity of the church 26
1257159 both a voice for the local church and one through whom the local church learns from other churches
1257160 the mutual interdependence of all the churches is integral to the reality of the church as god wills it to be no local church that participates in the living tradition can regard itself as self sufficient the ministry of the bishop is crucial for his ministry serves communion within and among local churches their communion with each other is expressed through the incorporation of each bishop into a college of bishops bishops are both personally and collegially at the service of the communion
1257161 n otwithstanding the substantial ecclesiological issues still dividing us which will continue to need our attention this approach is fundamentally in line with the communion ecclesiology of the second vatican council the consequences which the report draws from this ecclesiological base are also constructive especially the interpretation of provincial autonomy in terms of interdependence thus subject to limits generated by the commitments of communion windsor n 79 related to this is the reports thrust towards strengthening the supra provincial authority of the archbishop of canterbury nn 109 110 and the proposal of an anglican covenant which would make explicit and forceful the loyalty and bonds of affection which govern the relationships between the churches of the communion n 118
1257162 w hile the report stresses that anglican provinces have a responsibility towards each other and towards the maintenance of communion a communion rooted in the scriptures considerably little attention is given to the importance of being in communion with the faith of the church through the ages
1257163 has important ecumenical ramifications since we share a common tradition of one and a half millennia this common patrimony what pope paul vi and archbishop michael ramsey called our ancient common traditions is worth being appealed to and preserved
1257164 it is our overwhelming desire that the anglican communion stays together rooted in the historic faith which our dialogue and relations over four decades have led us to believe that we share to a large degree
1257165 in the discussions on human sexuality within the anglican communion and between it and the catholic church stand anthropological and biblical hermeneutical questions which need to be addressed
1257166 priestly ordination in the catholic church from the beginning has always been reserved to men alone
1257167 this tradition has also been faithfully maintained by the oriental churches
1257168 i declare that the church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the churchs faithful
1257169 lead to that unity in truth for which christ prayed
1257170 a restoration of complete communion of faith and sacramental life
1257171 belonging to the church of christ are forces impelling toward catholic unity

1257174 the fbi apparently applied a lot of pressure to all the investigators there at detrick and they found the weakest link
1257175 if they had real evidence on him why did they not just arrest him
1257176 one of the reasons they need to lay this out is so that the public can be confident that they are protected

1257178 i was once in love with an albino girl who wept pearls i was a young man then pretty as the autumn lovechild of a carpenter and the daughter of a shepherd
1257179 because of her skin she lived in shadow for most of her life and we all knew her face but never her name
1257180 on that morning that the albino girl stepped into the light for the first time the sun looked upon her face and was struck by her beauty
1257181 the girl fell in love with me and one lovely autumn day i knew her when she found later she was to bear a child we devised a plan to run away in secret to the hills all seeing and all knowing of things in daylight the sun became very jealous
1257182 one afternoon i had gone into the forest to fell and chop a tree for my father when the jealous sun summoned a storm
1257183 a change of mind as it appears to one who repents of a purpose he has formed or of something he has done
1257184 when i heard about this matter i tore my garment and my robe and pulled some of the hair from my head and my beard and sat down appalled
1257185 o my god i am ashamed and embarrassed to lift up my face to you my god for our iniquities have risen above our heads and our guilt has grown even to the heavens
1257186 sorry god for sinning ill try not to do it next time

1257188 phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest saw it he arose from the midst of the congregation and took a spear in his hand and he went after the man of israel into the tent and pierced both of them through the man of israel and the woman through the body
1257189 let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us looking to jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame

1257299 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1257300 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1257301 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1257302 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1257303 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1257304 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another

1257316 hes had some run ins with police in the lower mainland but not with us before so this is the first time we really dealt with him here
1257317 i think that would be stretching it to say yes it is we just havent made that link yet
1257318 it just looks like more to do with an emotionally disturbed person
1257319 he did mention to me problems and separation with his wife and that was about it
1257320 if there was any indication of him being able to do something like this i would have said something to someone long ago
1257321 you know how its in your blood your mama is an island girl and so are you
1257322 to live in and from the word of god in all our meetings assemblies and events so that as we regularly and increasingly hear read study share and are engaged by gods word we lead by example in faithful service and holy living
1257323 covenant together to begin a regular practice of bible study and prayer gathering with others in their congregation and or community to speak and hear the word from one another
1257324 in order to become more fluent in the first language of faith the language of scripture that we might live into our calling as a people renewed enlivened empowered and sent by the word
1257325 its really a matter of you taking the vision and deciding as a congregation how youre going to have scripture become more a part of the culture of your congregation
1257326 the enthusiasm for the book of faith initiative is palpable
1257327 there is a groundswell of interest in this initiative its an enormous opportunity that we have
1257328 this church accepts the canonical scriptures of the old and new testaments as the inspired word of god and the authoritative source and norm of its proclamation faith and life
1257329 my reply was that we in lutheran core coalition for reform are concerned for the interpretation of the bible as gods word of law and gospel and for the confessional integrity of the elca as a lutheran church body i added that what truly troubles us in lutheran core is the question whos in charge of the church is it private opinion and the relativistic mood of the times does the world set the agenda for the church or is it scripture and the confessions of our church
1257330 biblical authority as gods word of law and gospel is cores chief concern we hope book of faith the current elca initiative to study the bible will move our church toward a more lutheran approach to the bible
1257331 we in lutheran core pray regularly for our church and our synodical and
1257332 in a fight where scripture is often used against gay marriage the rev brian elster says god is calling on him to preside over the wedding of two men
1257333 same sex unions divide faithful pastors struggle to reconcile law with scripture
1257334 knowing he would be asked by two of his congregants to perform their marriage he asked for the approval of higher ups he said bishop dean w nelson gave his ok as long as elsters own congregational leaders also approved it that council met twice and voted to sanction elsters involvement in the wedding it wasnt unanimous
1257335 what it says is that there is a division in opinion in the congregation that reflects the division of opinion in the community
1257336 im going out on a limb there are people who firmly disagree with what im going to do
1257337 when it comes to two people who say they want to enter into a covenant of faithful commitment to each other what should we do but stand up and applaud
1257338 his role as a pastor is to recognize gods presence in peoples lives and if that presence is nurtured by the union of two people its his job to bless that union
1257339 a new wave of gay seminarians prepares to take the pulpit
1257340 calling someone who is not on the elca clergy roster is in violation of the congregations constitution c6 03 c it is also a breach of their covenant with the other elca congregations
1257341 calling a pastor who is not on the elca clergy roster could open them up to disciplinary action
1257342 she will not be considered an elca pastor she would not be ordained into this church or any other church we are aware of
1257343 accepting this call could jeopardize a future application to be on the elca clergy roster
1257344 he has the freedom to not discipline us or to discipline us that is his
1257345 to be quite honest availability for press interviews just prior to the event and preferred seating for the press left me and others with the feeling of a publicity stunt
1257346 ordained ministers shall be subject to discipline for willfully disregarding the provisions of the constitution or bylaws of this church
1257347 the expectations of this church regarding the sexual conduct of its ordained ministers are grounded in the understanding that human sexuality is a gift from god and that ordained ministers are to live in such a way as to honor this gift ordained ministers are expected to reject sexual promiscuity the manipulation of others for purposes of sexual gratification and all attempts of sexual seduction and sexual harassment including taking physical or emotional advantage of others single ordained ministers are expected to live a chaste life married ordained ministers are expected to live in fidelity to their spouses giving expression to sexual intimacy within a marriage relationship that is mutual chaste and faithful ordained ministers who are homosexual in their self understanding are expected to abstain from homosexual sexual relationships
1257348 credentials and rosters qualified candidates of all sexual orientations and gender identities for ministry
1257349 bishop holmerud and his wife debbi rode on the back of a convertible leading a group of 45 lutherans concerned supporters
1257350 have intentions to bring charges for discipline against a pastor who chooses to solemnize a same gender marriage
1257351 discharge his duties in accordance with the holy scriptures and the confessions of the lutheran church and in harmony with the constitution of this synod

1257699 even you yesterday you had to ask me where it was at i couldnt believe after all these years you didnt know me any better than that
1257700 wow thats different than every other festival where you can see umphreys and sector nine
1257701 still this survival is bound to go down as one of the greatest mountaineering tales in k2s history
1257702 they had to descend without any safety lines and in that descent we know that some climbers have slipped down and their whereabouts are unknown
1257703 to send an airplane that could make a circle around the mountain to see if they can locate anyone
1257704 moving river of ice broke loose like an iceberg breaking loose from a glacier
1257705 not only did it wipe away the fixed ropes but it brought the whole slope into icy dangerous conditions
1257706 actress has nothing to do with the drugs and has already told the government everything she knows
1257707 we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death
1257708 and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1257709 heath was a friend his death is a tragic loss
1257710 i think its just an advantage to anybody whos played a tournament of that intensity going into the pga because the golf course changes when the heat of battle comes on and youve got a bit of adrenaline
1257711 certainly the last ryder cup there there are definitely shots some of the par threes changed significantly
1257712 theyre not forced to play it right from the tips but they probably will do
1257713 i think theyll probably set it up equally as tough
1257714 i think its a good golf course i think itll be very very demanding
1257715 i love that golf course i think its a great golf course they have made some changes caseys coach peter kostis went over there and played it and gave me a rundown
1257716 obviously some tees have been lengthened and some bunkers have been repositioned and ill have a look at that when i get there early in the week
1257717 but its a good golf course ive got good memories around it
1257718 right now were clearing things up at hallands s a lot of trees have fallen on the tracks and the overhead contact lines but we expect to be able to open the west coast line v stkustbanan through hallands s at twelve
1257719 rizla suzuki has proven it can run at world level and tom has proved he can run at world level we were running our bike in bsb spec which is 5 kg over the minimum wsbk weight limit so weve done a terrific job
1257720 the first race was very very disappointing because i think we could have had a podium
1257721 he hung in there until obviously the water went and then that was it but in the meantime with a slowing bike he still passed corser for third
1257722 the channel between the rocks south of lobster beach and shifting sandbars on the ettalong beach side has been reduced to between 12m and 15m wide depending on the tide
1257723 but to be honest i dont know what more i couldve done given the time frame that i had coming off this injury i did about as much as i could
1257724 i felt like i was going to be rusty coming into this tournament but then i think i had a little false sense of confidence from winning that wild card tournament
1257725 i think im a little bit rustier than i couldve hoped for

1257731 is it true that in england you considered handing over madeleines custody to a relative
1257732 did you have any responsibility or intervention in your daughters disappearance
1257733 are you aware that in not answering the questions you are jeopardising the investigation which seeks to discover what happened to your daughter
1257734 the jammu and kashmir government committed a big mistake by transferring the land to the sri amarnath shrine board and then revoking the same later in the face of protests
1257735 these issues are very complicated and are inter connected with each other with beijing

1257737 we think this could be as many as 3 000 patients worldwide which would equate to roughly 90 million in revenue
1257738 weve said ever since the reintroduction that we anticipate seeing additional cases
1257739 i cannot understand how an argentine player who has been in pre selection for the olympic squad and has played in the champions league and at a club like liverpool is not good enough
1257740 marco is being accompanied by four rescuers and most probably hell be brought tonight to the advance base camp at an altitude of 6 000 metres
1257741 of course of course ill keep going imagine if i gave up now
1257742 they were thinking of my gas my rope whatever everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody was leaving each other
1257743 people didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem and then things like that happen
1257744 the biggest mistake we made was that we tried to make agreements everybody had his own responsibility and then some people did not do what they promised
1257745 yesterday was a wonderful day there had been four days of sunshine before yesterday today is it hazy is it pollution i dont know at this stage
1257746 the expert advice we are getting is that the situation continues to improve and the measures they put in place are still having a positive effect
1257747 we have been training in macau for a couple of weeks where it was hotter and more humid so hopefully by the time it comes to the matches we will be used to it
1257748 that depends not only on human endeavour but on mother nature too
1257749 yesterday we didnt see any algae its the cleanest day we have had
1257750 it is not appropriate to discuss anything now but we will reveal the results of our investigation later
1257751 the ploy of the bloody crime resembles some previous terrorist attempts carried out by eastern turkistan separatists which were foiled by chinese police
1257752 people can think what they want and they have a right to their opinion but i dont think signing me is a risk
1257753 i want to play football and i want to play at the highest level possible as well as playing as well as i can i have had a difficult time over the last couple of years but now i want to let my football do the talking and be a success at linfield
1257754 i know that at linfield every game is a cup final and i am not worried by that
1257755 we will go out to try to win every game and if we do that then we will win the league
1257756 i know that a lot of people are already predicting that glentoran are going to win the league
1257757 i heard some so called experts on the radio the other day saying that its the glens who will come out on top but we will see about that
1257758 we will all be trying to make them eat their words come the end of the season
1257759 i won the cis cup when i was with cliftonville and i am at linfield to win more medals
1257760 we have started off well in pre season and we played very well in our european game against dinamo zagreb
1257761 we will be looking at that as our inspiration for when the league starts and try to match that performance
1257762 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time shiloh calls them her babies she and zee pick their clothes and help change and hold them its sweet they are little mummies
1257763 viv is proving to resemble ang in spirit attitude and physicality and knox hes a bit of me
1257764 this is mads fourth fifth time becoming an older bro hes asking us when we can have more
1257765 we have been fortunate never to have had fertility problems
1257766 rasmussen is the most handsome prime minister in europe i think i will introduce him to my wife because he is even more handsome than cacciari
1257767 we see all sorts of people the thing that links them is that they have no money worries accountants doctors even footballers and politicians
1257768 cultivating whatever gave pleasure to my senses was always the chief business of my life i never found any occupation more important
1257769 i love my husband that is why i want to swap him
1257770 police are investigating the arrival of campaigners believed to have breached their bail conditions but we cannot confirm how many arrests have been made
1257771 im pretty nervous about being arrested because ive never been to prison it will be bad but the worst thing about being arrested will be that i wont get to go to an event that i have been planning for a long time this is one of the most important issues of our generation and its vital that we are allowed to discuss it its tragic that the police seem to want to stop that
1257772 im sorry i havent said anything before but i didnt want to worry you it looks like i might be arrested at climate camp it is my choice and its something i feel strongly about please dont be angry
1257773 we are also doing this because we feel our bail conditions are disproportionate to our supposed offences i can see the logic in keeping us away from power stations but to keep us away from this event where people are meeting to discuss how to tackle climate change is wrong
1257774 the new 12 team league places the best players in that league and the competition will be cut throat now there will be a huge scramble to get into that top six as your last round of matches wont be meaningless but you perhaps may not be playing the bigger clubs
1257775 financially its a big bonus getting into the top six and clubs that are assembling good squads would have that vision of getting into the top six
1257776 ultimately that has to be the aim and we have setanta cup football as well
1257777 we dont have a huge squad but you cannot deny the players a chance to impress in that competition
1257778 its been a bit strange not travelling up the road with marty quinn
1257779 but davy platt has been with us for a few years as coach so it doesnt really feel that different the targets remain the same to keep improving and hopefully win a trophy
1257780 it is disappointing to miss the first game of the season but i think it is the most stupid rule in the world
1257781 i could see through it if you get sent off in the last match of the season and your suspension carries through but i dont think there is another league in the world where yellow cards are carried into the next season
1257782 i cant see how it works it is different if youve got sent off or done something wrong
1257783 i got booked five times in over 50 games which i dont think is an awful lot and to come back the following season and start off with a one match suspension is a bit harsh
1257784 any team that loses someone who scores 40 goals is going to be weaker so i think they are missing in that department
1257785 linfield are the biggest club in northern ireland if not ireland and they are going to be able to go out and replace him
1257786 they have already got one striker in with michael carvill signing and i am sure theyll get another one in before too long
1257787 everyone wants to get their hands on a major trophy but linfield are so far ahead and its so hard to catch them up
1257788 we have a good squad ourselves and hopefully we can do a bit better
1257789 linfield have won the league for the last three seasons so its probably in their favour again
1257790 all we can do is keep trying to close the gap and keep trying to get near them and hopefully something will give at some stage
1257791 as far as we are concerned linfield are the favourites again and we will just try our best to get up there and challenge them
1257792 i go out and try my best in pre season every year and then try to take that into the season
1257793 first and foremost for me is that the team do well that we win things and after that anything is a bonus
1257794 i still get a buzz from scoring goals all players do and as a striker thats my job and thats what i try to do
1257795 i think if we are honest we are itching to get back again because everyone enjoys going out and playing every saturday and trying to win games
1257796 my husband is my soulmate and we have a fantastic sex life
1257797 but after we had been married for five years and pushed every sexual boundary together the thing that scared both of us most was the idea that neither of us would ever be able to experience another person again
1257798 we love each other totally and neither of us wanted to have an affair so we posted our photos on a website and weve never looked back
1257799 we got our campaign off to a good start but taking on portadown is a bit of a frightening prospect if im honest
1257800 when you look at the portadown result you could be forgiven for thinking they could win the league at a canter and we dont want any side running away with it
1257801 you need a lot of things to go in your favour if you want to beat the ports and certainly luck needs to be on your side but we will give our all hopefully we will catch them on an off day but they are a premier league machine which has not been designed for this league we will keep working hard and see how well we can do in this league without making bold predictions

1257820 the trust has identified a total of 19 new cases of clostridium difficile in july 2008
1257821 this is a reduction of four on the previous month and the trend shows a continuing fall in the rate of new infections this is the lowest number of new infection cases in the trust for more than 12 months
1257822 we are however seeing an increase in the number of relapsed cases
1257823 this is a reflection of the nature of the illness that can reoccur in some patients for several months depending on the patients primary condition and whether there is a need to prescribe further antibiotic treatment
1257824 all of these patients have low levels of immunity to infection
1257825 in recent months the trend was in the right direction and in june the belfast trust was meeting its targets for c difficile
1257826 in july however this trend reversed and we had 58 cases recorded this compared with 27 in the previous month
1257827 today the figure is 28 patients with symptoms associated with c difficile infection
1257828 it is our intention to deliver a knockout blow to c difficile in belfast hospitals
1257829 we are building on the measures we have already put in place and drawing on the experience we have now accumulated and i am also asking the public to help us in the drive against c difficile

1257843 i always find it interesting when people use maritime analogies when they talk about leadership but it wasnt the captain that sank the titanic a ship they claimed was unsinkable it was the iceberg the best way to avoid disaster is to manage your way around the problem

1257929 the one thing we dont want is for kevin to change he averages 50 plus in test and one day cricket and he is an unbelievable talent
1257930 everyone will ask will his batting be affected but knowing kevin he will probably average 70 as captain

1257932 the first innings against south africa in the first test at lords earlier this summer was the one for me a lot was said going into that series and the finger has been pointed at him by a lot of people
1257933 he is a bit nervous at first but gets his head down and blazes a hundred that is a measure of the man when you see things like that i am sure he will take to captaincy in the same way he will take it in his stride
1257934 it is a tough job it is not just about being on the field moving the field about and changing the bowlers around
1257935 the thing is trying to leave it on the cricket field there is a lot off the field as well and i took it home with me from time to time that is what i found a bit hard about the job
1257936 michael said it affected him at home and he took the work home and i did that as well it is hard not to it is a hard job but it can be very rewarding as well if you get the results
1257937 you also need help from the rest of the side you also need a few people to lean on when i was doing the captaincy i took too much on myself and didnt have too many sounding boards or people to speak to about the job
1257938 kevin will be fine he is confident single minded and will have a definite approach to how he is going to do it get the best of foxtel

1258217 if i have to state my view there has been no progress in burma but i still have a positive view
1258218 the situation in burma is serious but it is not hopeless
1258219 in the last 20 years even though i have witnessed a sort of fluctuation in thai policy towards burma
1258220 the support of thai academia and civil society organizations remain unchanged and it is a great encouraging sign
1258221 at this moment we havent seen the concrete conclusion or comment made by the un secretary general regarding the progress and the outcome of the constitutional referendum
1258222 we will convince all the international players that the key is to find a solution and the 2010 election is not a solution for our country
1258223 distrust is rampant in burmese society resulting in a difficult situation to cooperate with each other and this has been for 20 years
1258224 some of the people can overcome distrust because a lot of them from all walks of life came out and helped people after cyclone nargis with love and compassion
1258225 these kinds of activities should keep going on and on
1258226 in fact the burmese people are strong hardworking and determined to develop their livelihood i am surprised that the burmese government treats their citizens as enemies
1258227 it is very important to remind the thai community and the world that though we havent seen change we expect it will come soon

1258230 a huge fireball formed in the sky directly beneath it is matsuyama township together with the flash came the heat rays and blast which instantly destroyed everything on earth and those in the area fell unconscious and were crushed to death then they were blown up in the air and hurled back to the ground the roaring flames burned those caught under the structures who were crying or groaning for help when the fire burnt itself out there appeared a completely changed vast colorless world that made you think it was the end of life on earth in a heap of ashes lay the debris of the disaster and charred trees presenting a gruesome scene the whole city became extinct citizens who were in matsuyama township the hypocenter were all killed instantly excepting a child who was in an air raid shelter
1258231 i was talking about work with my colleague but in a moment he was killed instantly by a crane which crushed half of his body it was a shocking sight and a horrible way to die his head was smashed his belly torn and his bowels ballooned
1258232 at that time i was riding a red bibycle on the streets of sumiyoshi township about 2 kilometers from the hypocenter i was 16 years old and it was my second year as a telegram messenger the moment of face i was blinded by the flash and thrown 3 meters away by the blast that came from my rear left and my bicycle was twisted and bent it was strange that i was not bleeding and did not feel any pain until i reached an underground shelter 300 meters away the moment i reached the shelter i felt severe pain in my back which ran through my whole body from then on for three days and three nights i kept on groaning in the shelter and on the fourth day i was finally rescued and sent to a first aid station
1258233 in the early stages the only treatment i received for my burns was the application of a mixture of ash and oil as a substitute for medicine
1258234 thereafter as a result of the several operations i underwent i escaped death and returned to work since i have once given up my life i wish to dedicatemy new life to the struggle against atomic bombs

1258426 doubling of oil prices in the past year is a crisis for millions of americans
1258427 it is just a frank reality we have to do something
1258428 people have had to make some drastic changes in their own life so they are ready to see the government make some choices
1258429 sterlite is a very good long term bet but if somebody can buy at a lower level it is better because it is a long term good stock to buy and hold in a portfolio
1258430 sesa goa again is a very strong company the newspaper reports suggest that this price control etc but actually there is a demand supply mismatch of iron ore and sesa goa is a very strong good quality company to own in a portfolio
1258431 in ranbaxy as far as the open offer is concerned its at about rs 737 so if somebody is taking a delivery at this price at about rs 522 levels and if he is tendering his shares in the open offer obviously the acceptance ratio is likely to be about 30 33 so 33 shares of his suppose assuming that he is buying 100 shares at rs 522 33 shares of his would get accepted at about rs 737 so that will bring down the average cost price of the remaining 67 shares at about rs 420 430 levels so that would be the price after the open offer ends actually
1258432 so at about rs 420 levels ranbaxy would be trading at about 20 times the current years earnings because this year we do expect that the company to report about rs 20 21 kind of earnings so thats a reasonable level for ranbaxy to trade and it could be about 3 times the sales so we dont see much upside in ranbaxy from that level but at the same time the downside is very limited
1258433 on bpcl there is nothing on the charts it is a volatile stock it goes up comes down i wont touch it there is no sense of direction either
1258434 bongaigaon has done very good things if you understand that business then this is a stock that should be bought on dips there are much more ambitious targets there on the charts
1258435 we like sugar and tea sector in agricommodity space because of the fundamental reasons in case of sugar by early next year we are expecting that ethanol would be compulsorily blended 10 that is very positive secondly the news has come that brazil would be exporting less sugar to the world market this year that will keep the sugar prices in world market up
1258436 the most important thing is that the production of sugarcane this year would be much less to the extent of 22 million tonne that is an official figure but our estimate is slightly lower it is because of the bad weather in north but more importantly lot of sugar cultivation because somehow they did not get the money from mills for last two three years the farmers have diverted those to wheat because wheat prices were up and they got good money in that so net net the acreage has sunk and your production would be much lower so this is a win win situation for the sugar
1258437 in case of tea if i may say that already they have increased the prices more price increase would be happening because of political problem in kenya production is down in north we have seen because of weather tea cultivation is down so net net in tea also we are seeing strong price momentum both tea and sugar are very high operating sectors in the industry re 1 per kg increase directly adds to 50 60 crore at the bottomline that is a reason that we believe these two sectors are very good bets over the next six seven months
1258438 the fund was formed by eight investors who last year raised us 625m of the targeted 1bn
1258439 revenues for the quarter have moved up by 33 to rs 2293 million domestic formulations have degrown by 20 on account of extensive restructuring in the domestic formulations space exports formulations as a segment has grown by 92 to rs 238 million while api exports to non regulated markets has grown by 100 to rs 165 million while exports to regulated markets has grown from rs 87 million to rs 708 million
1258440 we have reduced our formulations exports business to a growth of 7 and 20 in fy 2009 and fy2010 and domestic formulations to a growth of 12 for fy 2009e and fy2010e we however upgrade our export api revenues from 15 growth to 23 growth in fy 2009 we have assumed that the company would be able recover lost ground in the domestic formulations space in the ensuing quarters in our revenue model we have written off amortization charges of rs 159 million for fy 2009 and fy 2010 for the company we believe the higher r amp d impact on margins would get evened out in q3 fy 2009 as the impact came in the q3 fy 2008 we maintain our earnings forecasts and maintain our buy on the stock with a price target of rs 60 based on 8x fy 2010e eps rs 7 5
1258441 garware offshore services ltd gosl reported 51 7 yoy and 25 9 qoq jump in income for operations for q1 fy09 pat jumped by 91 6 yoy to rs 99 million however the company reported rs155mn of foreign exchange fluctuation loss on its debt of rs 2 6 billion as on march 31 2008 as rupee depreciated against usd by 7 leading to a loss after extra ordinary items of rs 55 million

1258572 we can access more sites than we could last tuesday

1258574 i know this story from the new york times and the times of london
1258575 there is a line and there is chinese law nobody can change the law easily
1258576 of course the olympics will change us it has already every day i think wow its amazing to be here with the other media to share the same stage is great
1258577 i think the greater web access allows me to learn more about the world and how we can change step by step
1258578 the crowd is going to be huge for the chinese
1258579 with 50 000 people cheering for them for the opponent it can be intimidating walking into that environment but then again the chinese fans are tame compared to some of the places we play like mexico
1258580 in the past we were a strong team we had a lot of good results
1258581 but for various reasons our performances have been up and down
1258582 but the support will push us to a better level
1258583 if you watched the 99 final you could say they were unlucky not to win that game
1258584 i dont believe theyre the same team but i dont know if theyre that much worse or if the rest of the world has caught up
1258585 this isnt a sprint its a marathon were looking to be successful for a long time
1258586 i look back at the edmonton oilers with andy moog and grant fuhr
1258587 we want to make sure we have the opportunity to ice the best team we can
1258588 i want players to be happy when they win not about their ice time
1258589 definitely were going to push each other and play better and compete i look at is as a good thing for the organization
1258590 i always believe that you need to play a lot to have a rhythm but at the same you have to play well to deserve the ice time
1258591 given the physical effort you need to perform at this level i had to make a choice
1258592 the combination of real madrids competition cup and champions league games on the one hand and the netherlands team on the other would be too heavy a burden for me

1258605 after studying the schedule of real madrid and the dutch team i realised playing for both teams would mean too tough a physical load for me and therefore i made this choice
1258606 im taking no chances and after the enjoyable euro 2008 finals i can look back upon my decision with a good feeling
1258607 i had a comprehensive conversation with ruud and i can do nothing but respect his decision
1258608 i regret that i cant use his quality and experience when i compose my squad but i wish him all the best at real madrid
1258609 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay

1258613 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1258614 im so happy to be going with so many of my fellow athletes and training partners
1258615 it was a hard injury to overcome but i knew i really wanted to race the k 1 at this years olympics
1258616 this year is everything i just kept a positive mental outlook all the time ive never questioned my ability and my strengths

1258618 last time we qualified late and wed never been inside the venue itself before the olympics
1258619 this time i know what to expect i know what to pack in my bag i feel really prepared where last time we were kind of tripping over ourselves just to get there
1258620 i had a really good training camp while we were there in june
1258621 its a good thing and a bad thing but it will make it a lot easier to treat it like just another event which is a hard thing to do at the olympics
1258622 i ran about 30 seconds faster last year and it felt a whole lot easier
1258623 the focus in the summer is speed so this is a benchmark
1258624 i didnt know he was out there i got to the finish line and wondered why there was no celebrating
1258625 it was stuffy hard to suck in the air but im pleased with it
1258626 my arms were a little fatigued from the bridge mile but i felt ok out there
1258627 the last loop you really felt it you had to dig deep
1258628 we both want to have a really quick marathon so we chose california i know i would really like to break 2 40 there and i think its the course to do it on the women are running 2 35 down there so theres plenty of competition so hopefully that will push me
1258629 i am not so sure hes capable of backing off
1258630 i think hes kind of got a mind set which i think is the best way to race for a championship to go after it every week we wouldnt want to have him do anything other than try to win every race
1258631 im not a happy person when im not running well
1258632 you try to look forward at things and hopefully you can say that 13 is reasonable
1258633 it was pretty cool growing up and watching him and those times when he was able to run well and get those marks and think of the unbelievable seasons that he was having watching him when i was a kid
1258634 if theres a shot for it that would be pretty cool
1258635 the athletes village is really nice the gyms are great
1258636 we are working out the little details making sure the athletes are comfortable
1258637 the athletes are very pleased with the village and the training venues and competition sites most have been here for test events but to come back and see all the improvements that have been made we knew the chinese were going to be ready but we are very pleased with what we see right now
1258638 its one of the nicest apartments ive ever stayed in
1258639 i have been here three days and two of the three were very nice
1258640 we are still confident that by the time the games start the air quality will be good
1258641 we are hoping in the next three days the sky will be blue and the air quality will be there
1258642 you try not to get out in the sun too much so you dont get tired from sweating all day
1258643 every athlete that we have talked to is very impressed and amazed by the quality of this village
1258644 personally i have never seen such a nice village in nine games
1258645 after being here a week you get the same kind of things
1258646 they were taking every question seriously and making sure they will solve every problem
1258647 of course we will have a couple of problems along the way
1258648 everywhere you go there are not two or three people trying to help you there are 10 or 15 people that want to help you and make it easier for you
1258649 for some reason that day i dont know why i put it in my head but i told myself i was training for the olympics
1258650 three years ago i said thats why im here ive tried to keep that mentality and boom here it is
1258651 dalhousie was like where did this kid come from out of nowhere
1258652 i played everything as a kid but the only reason i was good at anything was because i was fast
1258653 that was the only thing i had basically nothing else no co ordination just speed but thats good for track you dont need co ordination just stay in your lane and turn left
1258654 if i can make the third round the top 16 thats huge
1258655 i think that this time around we are more confident as a team and we have a definite goal of reaching the team finals
1258656 our group of athletes has been together for a long time and we are all on the same page so coming together as a team is not a big issue for us
1258657 we have a good idea of how things are going to be at the olympics and what we have to do to be at our best on competition day
1258658 it is still sore but it doesnt feel injured anymore
1258659 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1258660 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1258661 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1258662 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1258663 i dont know the specifics if he is i might go see him when im done here
1258664 i was quite homesick calgarys so landlocked i just hung out at the lake one night and saw this learn to row program during the first week i fell in love with it
1258665 right away i set my goals that i love this lets see how far i can take it
1258666 that was the very first indication that oh im not bad at this sport
1258667 it was after winning the canadian henley that i thought im actually ok at this lets take it one step further
1258668 of course everyone wants to come home with a medal but weve really been focusing on what we can do to have our absolute best race
1258669 if we can put that race out there and have the race of our lives then well achieve our main goal and hopefully the race of our lives will mean a medal at the other end
1258670 i was just getting a bit stale trying to pursue too many things at the same time
1258671 i thought about my age too i started to realize that i could only do this for a finite number of years and if i wanted to say in 10 years that id gone all out i had to make some changes
1258672 i decided to see exactly what i could do while focusing on running 100 per cent be a little unbalanced for a time and absorb myself in just getting as fast as i possibly could
1258673 i had to keep my training up i didnt want to get into a scenario where i was selected to the team but hadnt prepared to the fullest
1258674 now that its so close im feeling like im in personal best shape and really looking forward to getting out there on the track and laying it down
1258675 nova scotia said if you want to sail for us wed be more than happy to support you
1258676 its great because its on the ocean theres something about the ocean i really like and i get to surf too you cant really do that in montreal
1258677 our goal is to walk away saying we did the best we could and were happy we put our best performance forward
1258678 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1258679 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1258680 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1258681 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making
1258682 our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season
1258683 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1258684 if he is i might go see him when im done here
1258685 and the opening ceremonies are going to be really cool im really looking forward to that
1258686 its been totally positive vibes keep it chilled out work hard on the water and off the water enjoy each others company and be good friends
1258687 dont think too much about it and dont stress yourself out maybe its not the same for everybody but thats what works for us
1258688 i came back first just dreaming to be on the national team thinking maybe it would be possible in a year or two
1258689 it was kind of surreal when we jumped back into the boat together just how well we work together its been almost fast enough that we havent had time to pinch ourselves and get scared or anything were just enjoying the roller coaster so far
1258690 i got here this morning to play and there wasnt a soul out here
1258691 it was a lot different from the last time i walked off this golf course
1258692 it was one of the most memorable weeks ive ever had certainly on that golf course
1258693 and it will be nice to go back to a golf course that i know that ive played well on and refresh and rekindle your mind with those good thoughts
1258694 that certainly is a golf course ive got a lot of good memories around
1258695 i havent seen it since i played it in 04
1258696 he has just been absolutely outstanding and hes the type of guy that works hard you walk in the video room when hes watching tapes and you can stand there for a half hour and he wont know youre there hes concentrating and trying to get the job done
1258697 its really my pleasure to be able to manage a guy like doc theres not much management to it
1258698 you pretty much put him out there and let him go and pretty much leave him alone
1258699 its nice anytime you can pitch with the lead especially early on it makes a big difference
1258700 you focus on being aggressive the little things dont hurt you as much the key thing is trying to stay aggressive and make them put the ball in play and really use the cushion to your advantage
1258701 i dont know how he gets it to look like that really
1258702 you go up there and its the same speed but it seems like its slower or seems like its a little sharper he knows how to pitch
1258703 excuse me mate can i just get you to move so i can take a shot
1258704 i think this is a good time to be a tech investor
1258705 having said that the time from darling ipo to out of business is getting shorter you have to keep your eye on the ball a little more tightly
1258706 he said we couldnt afford to say no to anyone
1258707 where was gonzalez last year when cal football needed the heimlich maneuver
1258708 she said to me you really should be involved in the civic structure
1258709 she facilitated getting me an interview with the philadelphia council for community advancement and they hired me i never looked back
1258710 she had unusual gifts and talent for helping others embracing those who were downtrodden
1258711 she had an uncanny ability to talk to the president of a bank and communicate with someone who was homeless you never saw any difference in her expression
1258712 she had unique communication skills and a stately presence about her she made people believe in her
1258713 the city has lost a gem in this great city of many jewels
1258714 we cant let that happen we have to take back what was ours to begin with
1258715 we want to make sure were prepared for every option
1258716 we dont want war we want peace but we will not let that second holocaust take place
1258717 sanctions can be effective as long as the iranians and the entire world understand that all the options are on the table
1258718 this is what we need to do today we cannot postpone it we cannot wait for the iranians to decide whether they are willing to talk with the international community
1258719 the general consensus in israel is that engagement of iran the general consensus is that this is the wrong way to go
1258720 i dont think that anybody really does believe that theres a diplomatic solution
1258721 the iranians are well known for attrition and wearing down their opponents with never ending negotiations that can go on and on this is their strategy and has been their strategy forever
1258722 they entail upgrading the status of iran in the region and internationally if they accept the incentives then iran will be translated overnight from a country that is more or less isolated into one of the major forces in the region
1258723 iran is a country which is openly committed to destroying israel is committed to performing another holocaust
1258724 i think that whats happened in israel the third generation after the holocaust has sort of gone back to a holocaust mentality sense that yes this could happen again the statements coming from iran have exacerbated that feeling
1258725 israelis are despite their skepticism and pessimism i think they are hoping that maybe the americans will be able to pull the rabbit out of the hat to put it that way
1258726 if the united states through direct engagement can stop irans enrichment program i think that would get full support from jerusalem

1258733 there are two kinds of people in the world those who love chocolate and communists
1258734 one dsp who retired in june was given oral orders to continue for a month while another in the acb was given an extension for a year when he retired in december last year
1258735 when the population is growing the state ought to increase its police strength but this has not happened for the last two decades
1258736 paswan was brutally beaten after he was caught allegedly trying to enter a house he succumbed to internal injuries when brought to a government hospital by the police
1258737 he was beaten to death with bamboo sticks after being caught by the mob

1258739 so what is next for utahs kelsey nixon the brigham young university graduate has five different cooking show ideas including one for children that her agent has been shopping around to production companies
1258740 where was gonzalez last year when cal football needed the heimlich maneuver
1258741 nanny why is daddy wearing black nail varnish thats for girls
1258742 the air is a serious concern for all the athletes going over there
1258743 you try to find as many natural ways to help as you can
1258744 will we have an edge over other countries that dont wear anything over their mouths perhaps obviously we want to do all that we can to put our athletes in a position to win medals
1258745 id wager times and distance events will be well under previous olympics and that will be proof right there
1258746 youll hear more horror stories when these people who are trying to compete go out there and have trouble and say i just couldnt do it
1258747 you cant get oxygen to the working muscles so it would certainly affect their exercise performance
1258748 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1258749 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1258750 does not imply in any way the indian scriptural terms are parallel to biblical terms or that the parallel references are saying the same thing as the biblical text
1258751 an attempt has been made to give a bible which is more relevant for india there is nothing added or subtracted from the text of the bible which has been reproduced as such
1258752 our sympathy goes to them we always told people to buy tickets from the official supplier
1258753 china se ha concentrado en el fortalecimiento de las medidas de seguridad y protecci n de las instalaciones ol mpicas y de la villa que acoger a los atletas por lo que pek n est ya preparada para responder a cualquier
1258754 para llevar la seguridad y resguardo a todos los que asistan a los juegos
1258755 the changes that are occurring in china are a microcosm of the changes in the rest of the world
1258756 weve been advising the athletes that this incident took place 4 000 km 2 500 miles away
1258757 securitys extremely tight around the olympics village and at all levels ive been to a quite a few games and the only one ive been to that is comparable is moscow
1258758 the humiditys quite fun its like rowing through a steam bath
1258759 i have no idea how i can train in such conditions who would clean the discus after every throw
1258760 it was ghastly they did not have a suitable commode so i was left in my bed this wasnt the nursing staffs fault but it literally resulted in my lying in my own waste for three days
1258761 i spoke to the disability rights commission who offered conciliation to the hospital but received no response and they advised me to take court action
1258762 i did not pursue the case for myself but because i was disgusted with the lack of basic facilities available the basic human rights for disabled people abandoned by the area hospital
1258763 we can only apologise again to mrs corner for the distress this caused
1258764 you miss class its a point late for class is half a point
1258765 if a player amasses five points that player runs at 5a m
1258766 we go into the auditorium i say team one youre on the clock 30 seconds and i have all the names on a big screen
1258767 if the team gets 10 points they all run at 5a m
1258768 people were aware of it and could push each other get to class get to class
1258769 but was it fun it wasnt fun running for somebody elses mistakes we had to go and run at 5 oclock in the morning
1258770 im always trying to figure out ways to motivate these guys to do well
1258771 to me it was pretty shocking what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
1258772 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
1258773 last year yahoos board of directors and management took steps to thoroughly reexamine the companys direction and to improve the companys performance
1258774 since then yahoo has made significant strides in executing on its strategy performing particularly well in light of the challenging circumstances of the past six months
1258775 we are at a unique point in our history where we have the eyes of the world focused on our company and tracking our performance

1258788 the memorandum of agreement which was supposed to be signed today is within the constitutional authority and within the legal authority
1258789 we stand by that that is why we are confident our supreme court will find this to be resolved
1258790 i dont remember if there have been accusations of this magnitude affecting the appellate court justices in recent history this would be a first
1258791 huh but the rates stated on your website is rm 420
1258792 the dmca itself contains no express waiver of sovereign immunity
1258793 indeed the substantive prohibitions of the dmca refer to individual persons not the government

1258801 were stopping short of going to a four day work week
1258802 for many of them education is a luxury because of the funding
1258803 were just trying to make it more convenient for students to be able to do that
1258804 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise
1258805 this is something i think has brought this team closer together you may think i sound crazy for saying that but i really think this is bigger than me and steve
1258806 i think that was a big step for this team to accomplish the goals we wanted to accomplish
1258807 because i felt like if i didnt forgive him then it would divide the team up and we could pretty much throw this season away
1258808 he expects to catch every ball and i expect to defend every ball
1258809 when you have those two types of individuals something has to give when its 100 degrees out there and youre tired and youre frustrated sometimes emotions get involved
1258810 im sure if he had a calmer head he would have made better decisions i dont fault him for that there are times where i may want to hit somebody but i control myself i tell some of my other teammates you have to learn to keep your composure typically people do crazy things they regret when theyre emotional i think he just got too emotional at the time
1258811 lucs a standup guy and i commend him for everything hes done in this whole ordeal
1258812 and were behind steve hes still one of ours i have a daughter and if she does something that i dont like of course im going to be mad but at the end of the day shes still my daughter and im still going to love her hes still part of this team and hes still our family so were still behind him
1258813 as long as they go out there and they battle regardless of the score of the game or the outcome of the game were fine
1258814 were trying to develop major league players here we dont want any quitters here
1258815 we were up ahead and they came back theyre a good team
1258816 i was outside i got lucky and it went through
1258817 it went right down the line so i definitely got lucky with that beause i didnt hit it that hard im just happy it went through
1258818 and its going to get bigger if it comes here
1258819 i thought it would be good for our kids to see that
1258820 but i think this will make them better men thats the biggest thing
1258821 it still appears weather permitting well be ready to play
1258822 im already preparing for next year and three years down the road
1258823 people wonder how do programs like grimsley and east meck stay on top when theyre graduating eight seniors every year you build from the jv build from the ground level where its not a one and done thing we cant afford that
1258824 it was an asinine decision and ill move forward better than i probably have ever had to its the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself
1258825 were still waiting on the doctors to give us the timetable on when were going to have this procedure done
1258826 i will not put myself into a position where i have to defend myself to state my side of the story theres no side
1258827 theres only one side a lack of judgment on my part
1258828 i have no excuse all i have is the opportunity to gain the respect of my fans to gain the respect of my family gain the respect of my co workers and gain the respect of the organization
1258829 im a fallen man im a man that made a mistake
1258830 i plan to mend the bridges that ive burned and help rebuild the bridge if i need to all by myself
1258831 the good thing is that we were both man enough to come face to face and talk without any other kind of altercations
1258832 were bigger than that sometimes when emotions are involved you do stupid things for me being a christian i have a forgiving heart and im willing to move forward to help this team win this year
1258833 i was trying to nibble way too much and make perfect pitches
1258834 i felt like i was seeing the ball really well
1258835 if i can come back and play third that would be awesome
1258836 but what i told the as is i want to be productive in the middle of the lineup again i want to swing the bat for you guys again im hopeful ill be able to do both
1258837 theyre going to open me up and make a game time decision about what to do
1258838 there are a couple of options which was news to me because id heard there wasnt much they could do obviously theyre not going to guarantee anything but they can do things to stabilize it
1258839 mark ellis and i were just saying we hoped this would get taken care of so he can come back healthy next year and be healthy thats important for us
1258840 hopefully it will provide some extra clout when im pitching cooking shows to networks
1258841 because ultimately thats what they are looking for a lot of viewers
1258842 that neighborhood was probably the largest turnout ive ever seen
1258843 national night out is an excellent program to prevent crime but also to bring communities together
1258844 whatever people think about the police department people care about their community
1258845 when i came out the officers came up to me and asked me if i was all right
1258846 i said yep bye and started to leave then they asked me whats my name and before i could get my computer on a paramedic grabbed my arm and said i might bite
1258847 what bothers me is they didnt even try to understand me
1258848 they just kept saying i might bite and that really hurts me
1258849 to be very honest i really felt kind of like an animal
1258850 they said that they might have to take me to the hospital
1258851 they would not even let me come back to the office by myself
1258852 they held onto my wheelchair all the way there and that made me mad even more
1258853 i realize i look very disabled but i dont feel very disabled
1258854 when it first happened i was furious i was thinking about suing the city for discrimination
1258855 you just think about your own kids and where they are and how quickly it can all be over
1258856 its such a shame to see someone so young die like that its a huge waste of life
1258857 i guess when it happens near where you live or near the people you love it feels more real
1258858 randolph county is south of greensboro and were the eden of the piedmont
1258859 i know thats terrible but greensboro can never get it together
1258860 greensboro wakes up and charlotte is so far ahead of them lets not be so obsessed with charlotte be your own city dont be so snobbish
1258861 i dont mind taking a shot at a sacred cow every once in awhile either sometimes you get a good filet out of it
1258862 laughter is the best medicine i think thats in the bible
1258863 do not go where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave a trail
1258864 the market is now more sure the reserve bank is going to cut rates next month and we would have the first easing cycle in seven years
1258865 the reserve bank statement did confirm in my mind a september cut is a given
1258866 all thats left to debate is whether its 25 basis points or 50 basis points
1258867 weighing up the available domestic and international information the board judged that the cash rate should remain unchanged this month
1258868 nonetheless with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1258869 on balance however it is looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
1258870 the reserve bank has over recent weeks become more worried about the growing risk of recession
1258871 this was my first mission trip with my youth group and i didnt know what to expect i was hoping that it wouldnt be too difficult and i would learn a lot from it what i experienced this week is something i cant experience anywhere else the biggest thing i got out of this was the lifestyle of the man we helped his name was carl and he has lived a rough life he is a very strong person to be able to still walk i personally talked to him a lot and learned so much he shared things with me he loved but had to let go of due to his heath issues he loved hands on work and since he can no longer use one of his arms it made it hard for him to watch us do all this amazing construction im so glad i got to be a part of carls life and i hope i can help many more people and give them hope
1258872 the first day at teameffort we met joe our team leader he is so awesome he took us to carls trailer and basically told us we had to build a deck and a shed with no instructions at carls trailer we were told to take down a previously made deck by an earlier mission group that wasnt up to standards joe gave us crowbars and hammers and told us to take the deck apart eventually we figured out how to accomplish the task using team work
1258873 at the teameffort retreat site we had nightly worship where we would play games sing songs and become closer to god i felt the same connection with god on the worksite as i did in the nightly service even though we werent in a church i sensed gods presence with the group so overall i think i learned that god will meet you anywhere and everywhere
1258874 when the deck was completely finished and carl was sitting on his new deck he made the comment that he thought there werent anymore good people left in this world especially young people
1258875 in tennessee i helped build a deck for carl the group before us had already built the deck and had dug the post holes and put them in the ground unfortunately though the posts were unstable and uneven so we had to take out the posts re dig the post holes put the posts in perfect lines and put cement around them so that they would be sturdy in this process carl watched us from his door he kept watching and waiting for his very own perfect deck to be built when we had only two board left to add to the decking carl opened his door and said he thought he could make it across the gap so we put a chair up on his almost complete deck and he stepped onto it the smile on his face was something ill never forget as we added the last two boards we looked over at carl and saw his humble delight carl was so grateful and he made all of us feel so happy for a man who was used to helping others most of his life he now could be helped by others
1258876 this mission trip was a very eye opening experience the most eye opening part of this mission trip was when we first arrived to our work site there stood a very poorly half built deck we realized that there would be no way to build on it and we would have to totally rebuild it as we took apart the deck re dug the holes and rebuilt it our group had revelation we realized we could have good intentions but if we were careless and cut corner it could end up with poor results having to take apart someone elses hard work made us really appreciate the hard intentional work and care that we put into rebuilding the deck this goal of building it right brought our group closer together and helped us to realize our potential each person gave it their best and offered their god given gifts to help complete a sturdy 8 x 10 deck
1258877 it was hot at our building site on the second and third day i prayed for some clouds to cover up the sun in our opening prayer i asked at least a little while god to make our work cooler by providing clouds us soon after we began our work i noticed that our morning blue sky was covering up with thin clouds everyone was amazed including me i also enjoyed listening to mr carl he told me that he had been an auto mechanic and had lived in sevierville for over 25 years i really enjoyed getting to know mr carl and building the shed for him
1258878 when we arrived on the work site at mr carls house the deck was half built but done poorly we had to take it apart and restart at first i dug holes to earn my phd or post hole digger and the second day we set the posts in concrete by the third day we finished the deck part when we had two more boards to put on the top of the deck carl said i think i can make it he really wanted to walk on a sturdy deck i could see that he really appreciated his new deck next week a handicap wheelchair ramp is to be built for his electric wheel chair
1258879 this past week we had an amazing opportunity to help out mr carl i was part of the shed crew as we talked to mr carl we learned how much this shed will mean to him he used to own an auto repair shop before he was sick when mr carl became ill he lost everything he owned except his trailer he told us that he always hoped he would have another shop and that is what we helped give him in the time i had to talk to him he let me know how thankful he was this past week was so amazing
1258880 during our work days at team effort i really saw god with us we had to build a deck the first team that was there before us did a bad job and we had to fix it the person that we built the deck for was carl it took us three days to build it and when it was finished carl walked out and sat down on the porch for about an hour one his face was an ear to ear smile i saw god in carl and i was so glad to see this man that didnt have any hope and was amazed to see how there still are good people left in the world
1258881 my experience this week was great i saw many cool people who had smiles on their faces because they knew they were here to help out people who needed to see gods love it was really fun building a shed for mr carl he was so happy when we finished the foundation and floor joe our leader was cool too later we spent time with our group tubing and white water rafting this trip was an all around fun trip
1258882 while we were in tennessee we had daily worship services teameffort leaders would speak each night about a personal experience and reflect on the story of the woman at the well on the fourth night a leader named tyler spoke throughout his talk certain things caught my attention one was a metaphor comparing a salt shaker to a church and how a church should reach out and affect others by showing gods love the salt shaker itself is the church and the salt inside is the people involved with the church just like salt in a shaker it doesnt do any good to keep it in the container also just as salt enhances a foods flavor christians should flavor the world with gods unconditional love and acceptance this comparison made me understand the reason of our trip
1258883 everything goes up and especially with respect to labor and materials
1258884 weve got projects that are laid out and will be staggering along the way
1258885 you look at current construction trends and they take a turn from where typical construction plans are

1258895 he has a great sense of timing about where to put the ball in anticipation most disappointing thing was the inconsistency in fundamentals and in accuracy there are three or four throws hes got to make better on a consistent basis to fit into our system

1258916 i try not to make a practice out of threatening bloggers with litigation id have more success swatting hornets
1258917 apparently j todd foster of the bristol herald courier is in a bit of a snit over some commentary by swac girl on her blog the thing that concerns me his response to her was the immediate threat of a lawsuit
1258918 the issue that matters for bloggers and editors more broadly is the absolute lunacy of foster s reaction to one of swac girl s recent posts
1258919 having worked in newspapers for many a year i know how journalists think of the jerks whose first reaction to a negative article is to threaten us with a lawsuit
1258920 boy am i an idiot i keep having faith in my brethren and they keep letting me down
1258921 one who or that which is greatly disliked or detested
1258922 but there s a reason that frivolous lawsuits threats are anathema to people who care about the right to free speech
1258923 for a journalist to use such a tactic as his first resort is a disgrace maybe swac girl is wrong maybe she or the blogger she was linking to owe mr foster a correction one thing absolutely is clear 1st amendment dependent newspaper journalist foster has acted without the judgment you d expect from a man with the responsibility of editing a newspaper
1258924 the writing is on the wall for the bhc circulation is falling the bhc paper boxes that lined the roads for years are now disappearing and being replaced by kingsport times boxes the bhc will continue to lose local readership the reason is j todd foster with any luck the powers that be will get rid of him when they do circulation will again grow
1258925 foster throws out a law suit would cost a blogger 200k to defend powerful threat indeed
1258926 i dont know why foster decided to bring out the sledgehammer
1258927 ill still persist on till the day he she is married

1258940 gaza is a virtual prison for well over a million palestinians its been under siege almost continuously for two years israel says it no longer occupies the gaza strip so the boat will not be asking permission from israel and will not allow israel to board the boats
1258941 as a doctor there is nothing more sad for me than watching my patients dying
1258942 the idea is when we get to gaza we have broken the siege
1258943 and in our estimation the big operation is only a matter of time we will follow them in we will not ask for permission from anyone the settlement groups will be ready and this evening we will start an organized sign up for them these core groups will do exactly what the group that reestablished kfar etzion did after 1967 they will return to the lands where they existed in the past and will rebuild them

1258970 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1258971 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1258972 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1258973 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1258974 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy

1258985 but i wouldnt want us to be ridiculously hyped because i dont think we could ever really fulfil it in terms of making a pop song that sweeps the world im quite happy with just a bit of praise
1258986 people always think we are one of those image bands you know where its all about image and the music doesnt matter we dont actually think about it much
1258987 i think if you are in london you are in a sea of bloodthirsty people in bands desperate for success whereas in southend there is very little happening so it is easier to get noticed and its right next door to london anyway
1258988 i dont have to like music to listen to it at the moment i am listening to a lot of dancehall and a lot of it is awful but there are aspects of it that i really like that will come into our next album
1258989 ive always been very secretive when i was little i used to make up my own languages well codes and id write in all these codes so i think it is just a natural thing for me
1258990 we were going to be one of the first new bands to do a proper tour of china as well but it turned out to be too expensive we were also going to do a tour of the middle east that was my idea but security costs became too much that would have been amazing
1258991 weve got a few new songs that will be on the next album
1258992 were not going to play them live because none of us can play the instruments that they are written for yet they are all just theoretical at the moment

1259009 theres nothing i can say to build these bridges back against the tides that washed them away the life has left this room like a thousand fires gone black against the sky and scarlet moon the smoke is in the air choking out the sun its rising in the air i cant see and i will find you there somewhere in the dark buried in a place between dead and broken hearts theres safety in the darkness theres safety in the dark i have left these shores to face the tempest night that stirs the stars against the waters with its storms the sirens sing their song its like a thousand hands that pull me down and break the course i travel on the ocean fills my lungs drowning out the sun its rising in my lungs i cant breathe i close my eyes to see the light thats leading me and i will find you there somewhere in the dark buried in a place between dead and broken hearts theres safety in the darkness theres safety in the dark

1259012 after the successful financing in the first quarter we have dedicated ourselves to our product development operations in the second quarter and have made significant progress across the portfolio
1259013 i would like to take the opportunity to thank kurt berlin for his outstanding contributions to epigenomics over the last ten years we are pleased that we can still leverage his expertise in dna methylation science and technology as well as intellectual property in the future
1259014 we believe that with our choice of senior vp product development we won the ideal successor to take over kurts responsibilities and to lead our product development programs into the next phase of epigenomics corporate development he will bring in the perfect mix of qualifications expertise and experience to drive the late stage development of our lead products through to commercialization due to a mutual understanding on confidentiality with his current employer we cannot disclose more details at this point but will do so as soon as possible
1259015 in addition to the significant progress we have made on the operational and product development side the first half has been characterized by stringent fiscal discipline coupled with revenue growth hence all our financials are in line with our expectations

1259039 world economy is growing at a fast pace demand from the growing countries especially from asia has jumped up swiftly and this has led to a spurt in oil prices
1259040 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
1259041 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1259042 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1259043 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1259044 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1259045 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1259046 its a fantastic opportunity for us at a time when a lot of our competitors are scaling down because of difficulties accessing their balance sheet
1259047 in the next three years we aim to invest north of a billion dollars in this part of the world if market conditions allow
1259048 were cautious about equity aggressive on mezzanine financing and well take our time during this period of market consolidation to build long term relationships with companies were going to invest with
1259049 its a fantastic opportunity for us at a time when a lot of our competitors are scaling down because of difficulties accessing their balance sheet
1259050 in the next three years we aim to invest north of a billion dollars in this part of the world if market conditions allow
1259051 were cautious about equity aggressive on mezzanine financing and well take our time during this period of market consolidation to build long term relationships with companies were going to invest with
1259052 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1259053 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1259054 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1259055 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1259056 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1259057 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1259058 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1259059 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1259060 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1259061 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1259062 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1259063 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1259064 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1259065 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1259066 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1259067 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

1259069 hand me the ax so i can axe the mean blogger
1259070 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1259071 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1259072 before you get settled in though it seems we have a problem you see strangely enough we ve never once had a human resources director make it this far and we re not really sure what to do with you
1259073 but i have higher orders what we re going to do is let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in
1259074 actually i think i ve made up my mind i prefer to stay in heaven
1259075 now it s time to spend a day in heaven
1259076 so you ve spent a day in hell and you ve spent a day in heaven now you must choose your eternity
1259077 well i never thought i d say this i mean heaven has been really great and all but i think i had a better time in hell
1259078 yesterday i was here and there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and we danced and had a great time now all there is is a wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable
1259079 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1259080 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
1259081 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1259082 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1259083 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1259084 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1259085 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
1259086 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1259087 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1259088 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1259089 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1259090 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
1259091 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
1259092 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1259093 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1259094 also if the couple does not live together the uscis will be very suspicious even more so if they have never lived together
1259095 eastern religions rank meditation higher than prayer now meditation is fine thing and all of us could use a lot more of it in our hectic lives but it is no substitute for prayer for meditation is only within yourself it is psychological prayer is between you and god it is theological the superiority of prayer over meditation is also shown by fact that there are techniques for meditation but not for prayer jesus did not give us a technique he gave us a prayer for prayer is from the heart and the hearts is foreign to techniques the heart in scripture does not mean the feelings but the will the self the i the image of god only the functions have techniques not the prefunctional root the heart thinking feeling and acting have teachniques

1259098 lignoranza verso la cina di oggi ha serie conseguenze politiche noi non comprendiamo come funziona il paese non sappiamo che fare delle opinioni del popolo cinese che pi aggressivo del proprio governo su alcuni temi inclusi taiwan e tibet e che spesso sembra pi antiamericano
1259099 il pi grande fallimento della politica estera occidentale dalla fine della guerra fredda stato un peccato di omissione non abbiamo perseguito una politica estera verso le nuove potenze emergenti mirata a creare nuove e durevoli relazioni con essi ad integrarli nelle strutture di potere esistenti e creare nuove regole sulla strada che assicura pace e prosperit se i paesi emergenti crescono forti al di fuori del vecchio ordine finiranno col sentirsi indipendenti da esso e non disposti a contribuire a costruirne uno nuovo il nuovo mondo potrebbe allora essere uguale al vecchio quello del diciannovesimo secolo caratterizzato da globalizzazione economica nazionalismo politico e guerra

1259101 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1259102 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

1259104 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1259105 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1259106 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

1259116 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1259117 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

1259126 only two partnerships in the north west were able to run the young apprenticeship courses
1259127 the students come from all the local schools they learn at college two days a week which is a model replicated by the diplomas
1259128 it requires a considerable level of maturity the young apprentices spend up to 50 days in the work place work experience is such a big part of this
1259129 im ecstatic about being accepted into kimberly clark i feel i may not have been accepted without the opportunity the college course has opened up for me

1259131 i feel prepared i originally took the young apprenticeship course because it opens up big opportunities i feel great that i had a variety of offers i would not have been able to do it without this course and the support of my tutors and my parents
1259132 having this one of a kind qualification gives me lots of ways to go its an amazing opportunity
1259133 we are very proud at first they said it was a bit of a trial juggling school and college but its been very good and its opened up lots of options for him

1259136 i enjoyed the course i like the practical side you get broad skills in joinery bricklaying plumbing and electrical if you want to get into construction when you leave school its a good opportunity you are two years ahead of everyone else because you were doing it before you left school
1259137 you become mature especially coming to college because youre in an adult environment and doing working experience

1259223 why do i do yoga what do i want out of my yoga practice
1259224 all of those are excellent traits to bring into parenting
1259225 as parents we need to nurture ourselves first get rid of stress before we can nurture our children
1259226 yoga teaches awareness you start by becoming more aware of your body
1259227 awareness expands and you become more aware of your self on the mental the emotional and the spiritual levels awareness is the key to parenting because you must first be able to see and hear how you are being with your children you learn how to watch yourself instead of just coming from an automatic response
1259228 because of the yoga practice of focusing on breath and doing more active work youre able to be calm during the inevitable ups and downs of parenting
1259229 since i was not upset i was able to be a much greater help to her

1259268 i havent felt anything im about three or four weeks ahead of schedule right now
1259269 i need to build some report with this fellow and build up to talking about his eternal condition
1259270 im a xxx because i couldnt get into medical school
1259271 if you get to close to your people you cant minister to them
1259272 i think a word of prayer would be good but im not holding your hand
1259273 fine you dont have to hold my hand do you mind if i put a hand on your shoulder
1259274 do you think this team will be in a bowl game this year
1259275 the major key is to get your team to focus
1259276 usually those who are older have the ability to focus on the task at hand theyre not easily distracted they can eliminate those things and stay on task we believe we have some new weapons we believe we have the tools
1259277 now if thats the case can you stay on track can you stay focused can you eliminate all the things that take you away from that thats where we will start at to try to get them to be older
1259278 i respect him so much and his ability just to stay the same the whole time when youre up and down when youre all over the place players read through that if youre panicking if youre pressing and they see that its going to make them panic its going to make them press
1259279 we know the deal everybodys got this deal thats our business now more than ever they pay us more and they expect more wins thats the way it is
1259280 i basically had to agree with them and call it a career
1259281 i have no complaints no regrets on where ive been and what ive done its been a fun career
1259282 my wife and kids have been great and i couldnt risk being pushed around in a wheelchair or something after my 16th year
1259283 hes one of the players when i walk away ill look back upon and say he made it worthwhile for me to coach thats why i coach is a player like chris gray because he has been a trooper a loyal guy dependable tough better player than he got credit for ill miss him i really will miss him
1259284 i wish i wouldnt have missed that one game against tampa
1259285 heck new right guard rob sims or one of those guys will break it in a few years so its not a big deal
1259286 i think everyones going to come back but right now its tough
1259287 i logged on at 10 03 and everything was sold out
1259288 a bunch of us at the office were looking at obstructed view and family view and even those were gone
1259289 sometimes those things can change overnight sometimes they may be forever
1259290 when you lose a guy that you think is a top player its a bit of a setback
1259291 but you really dont have much of a scheme if one injury knocks you down or two thats part of coaching to have contingency plans
1259292 but i told him that how you really judge a quarterback is wins and losses
1259293 i think we are getting closer its going to be interesting in camp to see how some of the speed and explosiveness that we have starts to fit together and how the confidence builds and how they play off of each other thats a good thing
1259294 we all have the same goal here that weve had every year that coach willingham has been here and thats to win games
1259295 and that hasnt changed and that never will we are going to do whatever we need to to the best of our abilities to make that happen so its not a distraction that we talk about or think about our focus is winning games
1259296 since coming to the games as a little kid ive wanted to play here
1259297 the reputation of this team has been damaged no question
1259298 it has been kind of stiff we just thought wed do things as soon as we can if there is a problem
1259299 this is the nfl this is what youve waited for your entire life
1259300 all of those things you did before this is what its leading to its an audition for all of the rookies across the nfl so whatever you do out there is either going to be helpful or detrimental to what youre trying to do the rest of the season
1259301 i was confident but i was nervous i think nerves just come with it i dont consider nerves as a bad thing youre here because we know you can make plays once you suppress those nerves youll be fine
1259302 we talk to them every day about what this environment is like in practice and what its really going to be like in a game
1259303 the speed the tempo the violence all of that is going to go up so theyve got to be prepared and ready for that then theyve got to respond to it once they realize that things are moving a lot faster
1259304 were going to try to execute our fundamentals and our techniques what weve been working since they got there in the offseason
1259305 now the key is to do that in a very fast high pressure violent environment thats the step they have to take next
1259306 were just trying to show them whatever we can do to make this team
1259307 they picked me and theyve got expectations ive got expectations of myself as well so its all about me going in there and making plays
1259308 and so it is done i say goodbye to all of you god bless and good night
1259309 right now the young men are losing youve got more young men ending up in jail and on the streets my deal is to at least try to give them an opportunity to let them know that there is money out there some of them just dont have the funding some of them have the ability the will and the want to to do it but they just dont have the funding thats why it was my goal to at least start something and encourage everybody else who has the ability to start something at their schools
1259310 just the little things like that and his football aptitude you can tell that he has really applied himself and gotten himself into the playbook and kind of taken that extra step
1259311 coach has the belief in me since sizzle isnt here that ive got the right to go in there with the first team and show what i can do
1259312 all i do is go in there and know the plays and get into my playbook more i think ive matured to the point where i know my plays and everything
1259313 its just one of those things where you can never really predict a guys timeline for getting it and hes shown i know its early signs that he has a much better understanding of the game especially at the nfl level
1259314 i think hes poised for a potential breakout season if things fall the right way
1259315 he came in this morning i think he had a 5 30 flight coming out of south florida and he was dressing for practice well we had to give him a physical first
1259316 thats part of the process and hes got a couple things to do but hell be out there this afternoon hes excited and ready to go
1259317 we do have an idea of what hes thinking but its just an idea right now
1259318 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1259319 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1259320 if he is i might go see him when im done here
1259321 i think they were kind of fresh yesterday today they came out and they were a little tired
1259322 the legs were tired but they fought through it same principle you fight through fatigue with good technique attention to detail thats how we get better
1259323 hey stover my cars messed up youre paying for it
1259324 hopefully it will provide some extra clout when im pitching cooking shows to networks
1259325 because ultimately thats what they are looking for a lot of viewers
1259326 its sad when officials have to decide the outcome of a race when professional drivers cant drive like professionals and push it to the very limit
1259327 obviously we would rather have had one winner we regret the way it came out
1259328 if you penalize one of us you have to penalize all of us
1259329 we will take a look at rulebook and the kiro video and well make the right choice
1259330 we have nine officials on the race course and it was a judgment call

1259371 i think when youre 240 pounds whatever the higher you run the more youre giving the defense equalizers youre letting them get shots at you i think you have to run with a little more forward leaning get your pads down more i think thats what well work on
1259372 i think all three of these running backs can play

1259387 its essentially an effort to reassure the public that law enforcement is held responsible said joseph mcnamara a former san jose police chief and a research fellow at stanford universitys hoover institution
1259388 historically government employees do not receive these royalties the government does
1259389 no one in his organization even knew how to make dry anthrax scientists there made wet anthrax which is far easier to make it is used in developing vaccines and testing their effectiveness
1259390 vaccine a the covert government experiment thats killing our soldiers
1259391 only one paper at the workshop reported near perfect results 100 percent protection from the ames strain with just one or two shots
1259392 why would active duty reserve and national guard personnel jeopardize their military careers and even their liberty rather than take the vaccine the missing element of the mandatory anthrax vaccine program is trust radiation testing agent orange the reckless use of experimental drugs and mysterious gulf war illness have made military men and women understandably distrustful of the pentagon on medical matters

1259394 ivins was hounded by aggressive fbi agents who raided his home twice
1259395 federal investigators have focused their attention on about four suspects at an army research facility in the terrifying 2001 anthrax letter attacks that showed up in the offices of two senators and several newsrooms including the post
1259396 the suspects include three scientists a former deputy commander a leading anthrax specialist and a microbiologist emphasis added at the bioweapons research facility at fort detrick in maryland sources told fox news
1259397 they are rushing to wrap this thing up they want it over with were never going to know because theyre not going to pursue this investigation theres no outcry for it thats unfortunate
1259398 i am now more convinced than ever that there were individuals inside the bush administration and in the government that wanted the war in iraq so badly that they decided if there was something they could use to push it forward they would anthrax fell into their lap even if he is the deranged solo killer they used him in order to scare this country and say iraq is something we have to go after and we did
1259399 in that case there would be no reason to go after the deranged solo killer
1259400 deliberately skewed to support the notion that there was a north vietnamese attack
1259401 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
1259402 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
1259403 abc news claim which they said came at first from three well placed but separate sources followed by four well placed and separate sources was completely false from the beginning
1259404 initial tests on the anthrax by the us army at fort detrick maryland have detected trace amounts of the chemical additives bentonite and silica
1259405 however iraqs alleged preference for bentonite appears to be based on a single sample of a common pesticide collected by u
1259406 in 1998 iraq reported to the united nations that it had conducted an artillery test of a live biological agent that used silica as a dispersant
1259407 bush administration officials have acknowledged that the anthrax attacks were an important motivator in the us decision to confront iraq
1259408 professor matthew meselson of harvard and former bioweaponeer ken alibek have both seen large clear electron micrographs of the daschle anthrax they have reported that they saw no coating on the spores
1259409 there is virtually no way an experienced scientist can make a mistake and not notice coatings of fumed silica or a silica coating or glass particles or anything like that on a micrograph particularly if they were specifically looking for such things which meselson and alibek almost certainly were
1259410 the matsumoto article simply ignores or discounts the alternative explanations and says that the spores were coated without any true proof that they were coated
1259411 why is this important because if the spores were coated that would indicate a large state sponsored manufacturing facility probably made them if the spores were not coated then they could have been made in almost any microbiology lab
1259412 lawmakers are overlooking constitutional flaws in their rush to meet the administrations timetable
1259413 the rather slow pace over his request for law enforcement powers hard feelings remain
1259414 congress has lost some of the shock induced unity with which it first responded to the 9 11 attacks
1259415 i wish they had turned this investigation over to some good sheriff or police chief somewhere i think its been very badly handled
1259416 but i dont think its somebody insane and i think there are people within our government certainly from the source of it who know where it came from and these people may not have had anything to do with it but they certainly know where it came from
1259417 we have not yet pressed those in enforcement to provide with far better understanding than what we have today about what they know the transparency level in health care looks good compared to the transparency level with anthrax

1259816 we had an agreement that there would be no nominations for vice president from both sides but about 18 minutes to 12 i was told that comrade joseph bunny witter and comrade patrick roberts were nominated so you will see comrade hay webster and myself being nominated at this last minute
1259817 we made the decision to nominate candidates for the vice president posts because we were not about to let them shaft us or double deal us
1259818 i believe that comrade harry douglas is now becoming senile
1259819 i do not understand what he is saying he had no agreement with the president of the party he had no agreement with the campaign chairman for team pnp he had no agreement with the campaign director those are the babblings of a senile person
1259820 now he chavalia gets to get back on with his life

1259825 the message i got out of all this is that its ok for police to go and kill in a drug raid

1259843 social exchange theory is an economic theory looking at the cost benefit ratio in economic decisions thibaut amp kelly translated this theory into a theory about relationships where we seek to maximize rewards and minimize costs in our relationships just as we would in making an economic decision
1259844 its a practical approach a pragmatic way to see the evolution of relations however its not taking into account that any one good aspect no matter where it comes from negates another bad aspect to create a balance between what is lost and what is found in the relationship dynamic

1259853 were talking about renovating or demolishing it building a new press box coaches boxes and club seating weve had a lot of discussions within the staff about it
1259854 we took a tour of the facilities and the press box and skyboxes at cajun field are embarrassing
1259855 to think that when we hosted the new orleans bowl a couple of years back visiting press coaches and university presidents sat in those areas that cant leave them with a good impression
1259856 weve got to get that done and we have to ask what else does the stadium need theres the possibility for open air skyboxes we need more elevators we need to throw those kind of things on the table let professionals look at the options and go forward from there
1259857 football is the sport thats bringing in the most people yet its the oldest facility without improvements from the fans perspective

1259862 as a parent sending your child to college what you care about most is where theyre going to sleep and the academic center
1259863 we need to provide money each year to hire a significant number of tutors to help our athletes currently that amount is 10 000 id like to see us endow the academic center we have certainly not developed a strong academic center that should be one of our first priorities because it affects every student athlete and helps the longevity of the student athlete
1259864 thats a better return on your investment than spending 50 million for a new baseball field or 30 million on softball because you help all your athletes
1259865 often especially in athletics you can get caught up in the everyday management of a department and not see the outside perspective
1259866 its healthy every 10 years the ncaa requires a self study theyll be on site here in november that in itself is healthy there may be some things that you dont want to see but it makes you turn around and focus
1259867 there are some things you take for granted and they turn around and affect other things

1259874 im hoping he will be here within the next two days
1259875 i thought the guys were doing a lot of talking and making calls which is something we really emphasized in the spring
1259876 the approach we are taking is to get 1 percent better every day if we happen to get 2 or 3 percent better thats fine but we cant do just enough to get by
1259877 when you play at the highest level things physically can go wrong

1259882 im aware of all the things involved whether theres surgery or there isnt
1259883 ill know next week but ill be back its just a matter of when
1259884 whats important is i get this done right the first time
1259885 if i can do it through rehab or if i need surgery its important that everything is right
