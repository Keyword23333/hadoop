7010007 pienso que el equipo est definitivamente hablando con fernando y eso es lo que m s le importa nunca he sido demasiado entusiasta respecto a mi situaci n en la escuder a dej ferrari porque nunca tuve libertad para hacer lo que quer a ahora s soy libre pero a n no me han dado un coche competitivo y sigo esper ndolo
7010008 siempre he dicho que el d a que sienta que soy m s lento que en mi primera carrera entonces decidir dejarlo
7010009 creo que es buena es evidente que el primer d a es dif cil para todo el mundo obtener los puntos de frenada sobre todo porque es un circuito muy duro en los frenos se necesita encontrar las referencias de frenada lo m s pronto posible y luego hay algunas partes que son muy similares
7010010 las dos rectas m s largas son muy similares por lo que una vez pens que estaba en la curva 17 y estaba en la 12 y me perd el v rtice y viceversa esto pas en el primer entrenamiento
7010011 en el segundo entrenamiento me enter de la pista un poco m s no es f cil es muy dif cil y tambi n el ltimo sector es muy agradable para conducir y es necesario que est s realmente concentrado para obtener el m ximo all se puede decir que no se trata de un circuito urbano normal es algo m s de un circuito urbano
7010012 me gusta el ltimo sector creo que la curva 19 la 20 y la ltima curva frenando con fuerzas g laterales es siempre emocionante y se mueve un poco en el asiento y la cabina del piloto y es una sensaci n que quiz no tienes en ning n otro lugar
7010013 no empezamos la temporada de una manera perfecta las tres primeras carreras creo que terminamos s lo en p3 p9 o p10 en q2 luego en barcelona dimos un paso y luego hemos mejorado el coche carrera tras carrera
7010014 ahora nos encontramos en una posici n en la cual siempre estamos por encima de la sexta posici n en la calificaci n y terminamos siempre en los puntos en las carreras esto es algo que al comienzo de la temporada era imposible para nosotros por esto estoy seguro de que estamos mejorando estamos subiendo y este fin de semana es de esperar que demos otro paso adelante
7010015 nada en absoluto como ya he dicho muchas veces creo que para el pr ximo a o el tiempo para pensar acerca de ello ser al final de la temporada o en la ltima parte del campeonato ahora no estoy hablando con nadie y no es el momento estoy plenamente concentrado en el campeonato y creo que ser a un error pensar en el pr ximo a o tan temprano
7010016 si me siento orgulloso de las carreras en espa a por supuesto que estoy muy orgulloso y ahora con una segunda carrera es algo que yo no esperaba hace tres o cuatro a os con seguridad no podemos olvidar que en 2003 cuando empec a ganar carreras con renault y estar en el podio la retransmisi n a nivel nacional no era en directo
7010017 el problema a su juicio es que la asociaci n nazca con fortaleza y que haya apoyos suficientes y que esos apoyos se sigan manteniendo porque puede pasar que cuando nos vayamos con los cad veres de nuestros familiares nos olvidemos de la asociaci n
7010018 en caliente ha habido insultos entre partes y llegar a un acuerdo sobre una cosa de este tipo pele ndonos no es un buen augurio

7010082 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7010083 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7010084 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

7010103 seagulls are a menace to scottish towns and cities they thrive on litter and their aggressive behaviour towards other birds pets and even people is increasingly problematic dumfries has a particular problem with gulls with regular reports of divebombing
7010104 i even read this week about a young paperboy who has had to abandon his deliveries due to constant attacks from the birds
7010105 you find these gulls making territorial noises in the middle of the night
7010106 some people are not concerned about it other people might be experiencing bad health effects from it so i think there s a legitimate cause to control gulls in certain circumstances under the terms of the law

7010161 a few folks took bills comments on windows server and applied them to windows client deriving that windows vista would be the last 32 bit operating system that is an incorrect extension while windows vista includes both 32 bit and 64 bit and there is a growing community of drivers for 64 bit windows vista we have not decided when windows client will follow windows server and become 64 bit only

7010222 the electronic systems which guarantee our safety have been jammed and scrambled
7010223 both of our ships are flying greek flags in international waters and we are victims of electronic piracy
7010224 we are civilians from 17 nations on this project to break the siege of gaza we are not experienced sailors
7010225 at least 70 innocent civilians most of them women and children
7010226 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7010227 we stand by our account and our reports and what we know and i cant reconcile why the interior ministry would have a different figure
7010228 the strike is part of continuing protests against indias rule in kashmir
7010229 it is also to demand our right to self determination through a referendum
7010230 the fighting that is still raging has so far left five militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7010231 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7010232 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7010233 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7010234 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7010235 step in the right direction but the problem is that in iraq there are so many parties so many factions
7010236 the war in iraq has been long and difficult and thousands of families have paid the ultimate price during its course
7010237 the fact that an agreement between the iraqi and u s governments is so close is a reflection of the sacrifice bravery and commitment of our troops and their families our troops will be able to return having achieved real results a stable democratic iraq that can defend itself they are to be commended for their service
7010238 this function is set out in the joint position of russia and france
7010239 should we sit behind the fence what use would we be then they georgian forces will drive around in hummers move munitions around in trucks and are we supposed to just count them
7010240 certainly there are high expectations from the public from the new government we will fulfill their aspirations by working in objective and planned manner for which we have outlined a number of national priority issues
7010241 first and foremost is the protection of national sovereignty independence and territorial integrity if nepal does not exist then there is no meaning for anything else including the republic but we have to strengthen the national unity based on full equality among people from himal pahad terai and madhes
7010242 i want to extend full commitment towards modern democratic principles like multi party competition period elections rule of law
7010243 our attention will be concentrated on addressing socio economic issues such as poverty unemployment and so on we will work to bring about modern industrial economy for which private public partnership model will be followed
7010244 the industrial peace will be maintained by improving relations between labor and employers
7010245 taking the peace process to logical conclusion and writing constitution on time is the main task of this government
7010246 this government also has huge challenges we need the support and cooperation from army police administration international community and general public to meet the challenges
7010247 every effort is made to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives
7010248 the day that the disappearance of the indigenous communities in the jungles and mountains was avoided
7010249 this is a new dawn for the people of this country and for all peruvians who wish to develop in freedom not in oppression
7010250 if that were to happen out of fear of protesters fear of unrest peru would some day remember it as the moment when change came to a halt and hundreds of thousands of people were condemned to poverty exclusion and marginalisation
7010251 the war against terror has to be pursued through a co operative effort between afghanistan pakistan the north atlantic treaty organisation nato and the us
7010252 unfortunately there was no chemistry between general r pervez musharraf and afghan president hamid karzai which did not facilitate co operation between the two countries i think we will see a more co operative phase after musharraf
7010253 i do not think induction of nato or american troops on the pakistani side is even something that anybody seriously considers

7010320 if the end result is as we hope a more efficient and effective service then i am sure all colleagues on the council will agree that it was worth spending the money

7010346 i bet youre using your weary magic like its new driving so fast with a new fool beside you presumably believing shes the last of the lucky few i wonder if she knows shes being lied to like i do
7010347 you cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today
7010348 i just wonder why they call this place the coliseum maybe every time everybody comes here they get ready to be killed
7010349 i talked to him the other day and i told him i really like what i see but you need to play with more tenacity
7010350 he has a tendency to cadillac it a little bit and i just wanted to make sure he got into the right habits joyce is a hustler though dont get me wrong
7010351 you cant help but feel a little homesick every once in a while but i love it here
7010352 people can only dream of doing what hes done hes basically cemented himself as a legend of track and field
7010353 i dont think any performance can top what hes done here
7010354 usain wanted to start he wanted to lay the hammer down from the start
7010355 the coaches wanted him to run the third leg we listened to the coaches
7010356 all i can say is yo jamaican sprinters taking over the world
7010357 the crowd loves it they love when i put on a show for them
7010358 they come out and pay their money to see a good performance and also to see a personality so i go out there and give them a show
7010359 i definitely thought about that he scored one before i did
7010360 it went through my mind i thought the next time i get out ive got to take it the distance because he did its a very competitive game
7010361 theyre young and have a lot of energy they love to play veteran players love watching them
7010362 i thought it was a good game in some spots and in others where we need to pick up and do some work
7010363 i was glad to see we tackled better and caught the ball better than last week
7010364 you have to have a mentality that every time you have a shot to return it
7010365 my blockers i just trusted them so i could get going i took advantage of my opportunity
7010366 i felt the punter got a good kick on it and kind of outkicked his coverage i just did a great job of catching the ball and making two moves to the side hitting the seam and getting right up the middle from there it was nothing but daylight
7010367 we are progressing week in and week out i think you have to give guys opportunities to make plays and we did that
7010368 as a team we were more aggressive against him tonight and i think seeing him in san diego last week had a lot to do with it
7010369 seeing him last week you have it in your head how he pitches to you
7010370 he followed the ball better and had a good smooth swing
7010371 i want him to get back to swinging like he did two years ago
7010372 he was just concentrating on hitting it hard and it was going out of the ballpark when he gets back to that thought process hell hit 300 again i want him back to that cut
7010373 ted williams said 90 percent is from the head up and i wouldnt argue with ted williams
7010374 it was nice to get a combination of quality hitting and pitching in one game
7010375 thats what were going to have to do if were going to overtake the mets
7010376 and the ioc and fig should take measures to make sure the issue is put to rest one way or another we believe the ioc is moving in that direction we hope they follow through and hope for a quick resolution
7010377 if this had just been a race in europe i probably would have stepped off the track
7010378 but this is the olympics i gave it everything i had but there was really nothing more i could do
7010379 it just limited the things i could do in training especially the speed work
7010380 i dont think i was running 100 meters in 17 seconds
7010381 i just knew there was no way i was going to get it done
7010382 ive already got some races set up for europe hopefully i can get some good results at either 5k or 10k id hate to finish with a memory like this from the olympics
7010383 its all of them you take kobe out you put carmelo anthony in chris paul jason kidd i can keep going if you want
7010384 being a part of this is the biggest thing ever
7010385 that i am able to add a coach with the experience and credentials of jeff ruland to my staff is exciting
7010386 hell be an invaluable resource for our players particularly our big men and an asset to the organization as a whole
7010387 its weird the way things work out thats the first time i pitched against him
7010388 i was telling him all my struggles and he was telling me how he deals with it the mental side and stuff like that
7010389 he talked to me for a long time he was really nice i was really fortunate to be able to talk to him for that long out there obviously hes been doing something right
7010390 my last couple of outings have not been good at all so its nice to come out here and give us a chance to win
7010391 my sinker was good my slider was better really its just attacking the strike zone being aggressive and getting ahead
7010392 made quality pitches down in the strike zone he did a better job on righthanded hitters early in the game
7010393 if he doesnt have his sinker hes in big trouble
7010394 im not a guy to complain ill get back in the gym to work and get better
7010395 im just thanking god over and over and over so thankful i want to cry
7010396 i talked to charlie about it its something you just shrug your shoulders about and scratch your head sometimes you take hitting for granted you think its going to happen and then when you dont hit everybodys trying so damn hard to pick up the other guy that you get in your own way
7010397 we have to get back to how we used to hit
7010398 he asked me if i had started growing dreadlocks yet
7010399 she was as much a victim in this whole thing as anyone
7010400 obviously not physically but to have to witness the things she had to see and go through the loss she had to endure is not an easy thing its a testament to her strength that shes working through it
7010401 we talk a couple of times a day three if need be we try to stay in as constant contact as we can because even though im here we all are in it together
7010402 she said she appreciates our effort and all that weve done
7010403 certainly its good for her family to see were out here trying as hard as we can whether thats a tribute or not is up to them the last two weeks have been a roller coaster i would say as a person who is not fond of roller coasters
7010404 the olympics is already emotionally charged fighting for your country for pride then you throw in the bachman tragedy you throw in miles britton a make a wish foundation kid we had in our camp his only wish was to watch usa volleyball play
7010405 im not so sure four years ago the team wouldnt have folded
7010406 im going to attribute that change to hugh mccutcheon when he came in he decided we werent going to settle for being middle of the road for being maybe a contender he got a new philosophy of working hard working together no superstars everyone bought into it
7010407 obviously we would have understood if he wanted to go home
7010408 the olympics are the olympics its not life its two weeks of your life that are important but not nearly as important as your family your wife and her family
7010409 is i know so many more lives are invested in this than just my own in terms of what our team is trying to do here given that responsibility given that im the leader of this team i know theres some accountability on my part to make sure im here and able to do my job
7010410 that is one of the many admirable traits about him
7010411 its a fantastic achievement and ill embrace it and enjoy it but as soon as were done ive got to get back where im needed
7010412 just to be back among the guys i really feel like im close to where i need to be for the opener and im definitely going to get there in two weeks
7010413 i was very pleased with the exception of a couple of plays
7010414 its important for the offensive line to come together and be able to work together with the different calls so the running backs can see the different styles
7010415 shawn is a little bit different than max jean gilles in the way he protects and the way he moves around a little bit
7010416 you kind of have to give people an opportunity to get adjusted to this league
7010417 its all good they will probably give me the boos give me the yeahs
7010418 the doctors are convinced that this should prolong my career
7010419 i think what he meant to say was when youre going good theyre on your side and when youre going bad they get on you
7010420 everybody hears it why dont we have a big stud but if you can get that out of your mind for one second i know its difficult for a lot of people but we think we have six really really good receivers
7010421 theyve all played well when theyve got a chance to play
7010422 hank a couple years ago made some big plays for us greg lewis has made big plays in the super bowl he scored a touchdown jason avant we think is going to be a super inside player and then you add desean to the mix and we think we have a very good group of receivers we think theres no question in our minds we can win the super bowl with these receivers
7010423 i think you have to give guys opportunities to make plays and we did that
7010424 its obviously big when you lose somebody like kevin and then you dont have your other top receiver in reggie brown i think the preseason gives guys an opportunity to come out and showcase their talents and do great things for us we have a ways to go but its a good sign
7010425 eagles have officially advanced to the next round of the cbz fa cup following the decision by underhill football club to withdraw from the competition
7010426 underhill wrote to us and indicated that they had played their last two league games away to shooting stars and eastern lions and were therefore unable to fulfil their cbz fa cup first round match against eagles unless they were to play that game at home
7010427 they cited travelling costs costs of food and accommodation as the reasons for their withdrawal and we as a committee have accepted their withdrawal
7010428 they have been in camp at churchill high school for the past two weeks and we would like to thank the coach and his technical department and especially the friends of the young warriors people like newsome mutema calvin nyazema and patrick mutesva as well as parents of children who are in camp for the efforts they have made in assisting to cater for the team
7010429 they put in place resources for the welfare of the players and paid them their transport refunds and they have been sourcing for assistance from various companies to ensure everything is smooth in camp
7010430 unlike some people who want zifa to pay them all the time these people have gone out of their way to assist the association
7010431 we slotted the game as the main curtain raiser to the abc cup game between dynamos and caps united so there will be more entertainment for the fans
7010432 we want them to get used to playing before a big crowd because it is always different from playing before an empty stadium i would also want the supporters to be patient with the youngsters because they are bound to make mistakes and for most them it will be their first time to play on the artificial turf
7010433 it is important that we widen our selection base there are some members of the team whom we already know about but we still want to have a variety of combinations and this is the chance to try some of the players we have had in camp
7010434 so some of those who played in south africa might be rested
7010435 on a post tomorrow the numbers were split between the two choices yesterday
7010436 as players we made a resolution to give something extra in the game against masvingo
7010437 we went flat out to get the goals and it paid off in the end
7010438 even if we had lost that match i was going to be proud of the way we approached the game
7010439 the win restored our confidence and now we meet dynamos who are also eager to win
7010440 games between caps united and dynamos do not matter which club is playing better or who is in top form during that period
7010441 those games are determined by the better team of that particular day and this is why it is difficult to make a prediction
7010442 before the game against masvingo we had not done well but that big win brought us back into the limelight
7010443 a derby match against dynamos will certainly motivate our guys and we know that there is no other chance in a knockout game
7010444 it has to be a win or else you are out of the cup final and this is why everyone in our side is going to work hard
7010445 the game earlier this year was memorable for me but this is a new game coming up although i am hoping for a repeat of the 2004 clash where i scored and we beat dynamos
7010446 as i said we are motivated for just playing dynamos and preserving our pride while our opponents are more confident
7010447 dynamos are doing well in the league and those guys are just coming from the african safari where they also did okay
7010448 so i know dynamos confidence level is high but it will be at their peril if they come to the game looking at our performance in the league
7010449 i had never scored for the national team before and that was my first goal with the senior side
7010450 i am happy and hope to work hard for more goals
7010451 we fought hard to get a point in the last game against caps united
7010452 this one is a new game and we have to take it as it comes
7010453 we are still chasing glory in several competitions but we will take each game at a time
7010454 we are not going to interfere with the boardroom that is not our territory but i am happy to say everything has been smooth at our training
7010455 we won against highlanders and that was a good win where we played as a team
7010456 now we face chapungu and i foresee a tight game because they are also playing well
7010457 we will try our best and we have always been inspired when playing bigger clubs
7010458 the zifa board condemns the violence that we saw at the dynamos offices and would like to urge all the parties to stop this madness
7010459 i am working so hard all i do is work blah blah blah

7010473 she told me she still loved david and that she had been thinking about him and their baby
7010474 they even viewed a new flat together before dale was evicted and were looking at schools for their little girl
7010475 thats why its so infuriating that jen is now lying to the public my family and my son by denying they got back together
7010476 i made a mistake spending time with david after my mum kicked me out but i always made it clear i had no romantic intention
7010477 david and his mum have been trying to have a pop at me all week dale and i are really into each other to say its a scam is simply untrue

7010484 what is that whats on the telly tonight god help us lets go to the pub instead
7010485 here we have the deathless language of the committee each word carefully weighed balanced and rinsed of all life and passion a definition of public service broadcasting that exists only in the minds of those whose job it is to write such definitions
7010486 but you wouldnt ask your traffic warden to give you advice on what sort of car to buy still less how to drive it
7010487 we cant resist fragmentation or timeshifted viewing or multiple platforms
7010488 we cant and we shouldnt but unless we fight hard to assert the importance of mass audiences we may find that broadcasting as we know it simply goes niche and splits into a thousand pieces culturally its a loss not a gain

7010531 we are looking for three more players to come in before the deadline but they have got to be the right players

7010539 the closing order indictment does not charge duch for his responsibility as a co perpetrator for a significant number of crimes that occurred as part of a joint criminal enterprise inside s 21
7010540 this may prevent the trial chamber from fully accounting for duchs criminal responsibility at s 21
7010541 when unemployed workers have to start paying out these fees its sad
7010542 the person who uses the card responsibly and correctly should never incur a fee
7010543 in this economy people shouldnt be losing their benefits to bank fees
7010544 for some i think the change wasnt welcome at first
7010545 what is the reason that the co prosecutors did not include this case in the closing order of duch
7010546 then we thought we will do historical research and we want to know further why 177 prisoners were released
7010547 in the closing order co investigating judges did not mention this and it seems that in the closing order all people who were detained have been killed
7010548 this is their affair i cannot give further comment before the plenary trial
7010549 we think that all the work of ngos that provides interest in the tribunal will provide interest to our citizens
7010550 rainsy sees the devil in the details of necs rules
7010551 the national election committee nec has initiated changes in the voter registration process that could have far reaching consequences the nec is creating unnecessary and untimely work and procedures for people most of whom are unable to do it the necs initiative could practically end up depriving millions of citizens of their voting rights the victims will be mainly non cpp members because all cpp members are identified as such by their village chiefs and will receive in time related information assistance and facilities to do the work imposed by the nec most of those who do not support the ruling cpp will be left in the dark many international observers do not realize that the results of the 2007 and 2007 elections are largely being decided now through a biased registration process
7010552 the national election committees changes to the voter registration process are deciding the outcomes of the 2007 commune and 2008 national elections before they have had a chance to take place many international observers do not realize that the results of the 2007 and 2008 elections are largely being decided now through the registration process
7010553 sam rainsy is blasting the necs month long campaign to compile voter lists as a vicious scheme its a big plot being implemented in order to deprive up to two million potential voters of their rights the nec is independent on paper but in fact they are doing what the cpp asks them to do
7010554 new voter registration process in danger of being a paper chase
7010555 i am not in the same class as the big names
7010556 i will just try to do the best i can and show what i can do
7010557 im getting excited its a good atmosphere here in beijing i was a little stressed up at the african championships in namibia
7010558 i wasnt sure that i could come to the olympics but now i have won a spot and i am very happy
7010559 we follow game trails or very often the people walking through the area will have a path from one village to the next village
7010560 elephants make paths for themselves six foot wide perfect for training you can bump into one and thats dangerous
7010561 the importance of this cannot be put into words when we go to mountain bike races there will be 20 riders
7010562 we really dont have the resources cycling is very difficult to develop in africa
7010563 getting bikes for riders and keeping them maintained with spare parts thats the challenge
7010564 the heat isnt going to bother antipas were hoping that the european riders really suffer
7010565 mostly just because of the stress and the pressure that ive been dealing with over the past 24 hours
7010566 theres been a lot of doubt in my mind its the kind of thing ive never dealt with before its a little victory for me today
7010567 i didnt have that usual pop that i do at the 200 metre mark but i went for it marnie mcbean former canadian rower told me to fight like a tiger and i tried to it was really tough thats why kenny passed me i was toast
7010568 i just ended up lying around and tossing and turning a lot which probably isnt the best way to deal with something like that but i didnt know what else to do i probably had four or five cold showers but that didnt do anything either

7010706 all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france

7010710 instead of having a single major fault or a few major faults we tend to have a lot of very minor and sort of subtle faults

7010726 under the cover of needing to deliver humanitarian goods nato countries continue to boost their naval grouping
7010727 in addition to the spanish and german frigates that entered the black sea basin on august 21 yesterday a polish frigate and a destroyer of the us navy passed the bosphorous
7010728 i dont think that this will help stabilise the situation in the region
7010729 under the cover of needing to deliver humanitarian goods nato countries continue to boost their naval grouping
7010730 in addition to the spanish and german frigates that entered the black sea basin on august 21 yesterday a polish frigate and a destroyer of the us navy passed the bosphorous
7010731 this year like last year where we had cynthia from the united kingdom we are still accommodating models from the diaspora
7010732 we are pleased with the turn up at least 25 groups have registered for the contest and more groups are still welcome to come and join the jibilika family
7010733 we want to celebrate the diversity and richness of different genres of dance from all corners of the world as it unites the youth and makes us one thus the need for us to have all categories of dance coming together and celebrating dance
7010734 the last thing i would want is to rush them into a product that will turn out to be an embarrassment or a mockery of their father who was such a great artiste
7010735 so my mission is to accommodate morgan and tendai in my free time and then get them to play instruments the same way or almost the same way their father did
7010736 tendai is playing the lead guitar which his father used to play while morgan is playing bass and is also doing vocals
7010737 obviously it will be almost impossible for them to reach their fathers level but given that they have shown commitment it is possible for them to do just as suluman and tryson have done in reviving their fathers music
7010738 i have worked with both suluman and tryson helping them here and there and i think they have done very well so far to revive their fathers music
7010739 morgan and tendai can do the same and just like suluman and tryson they will have to redo their fathers work and also come up with their own compositions
7010740 the problem at the moment is that morgan and tendai are staying in ridgeview while im in chitungwiza
7010741 there is little free time during the week as most of the time i will be working with the band orchestra mberikwazvo while friday to sunday we have shows
7010742 but it will be much better if they dembo sons were closer so that i have more time with them they can even attend our practice sessions
7010743 so the one option is for them to move to chitungwiza where their fathers house is but that will have to be approved by their mother who is with them in ridgeview
7010744 of course we would have loved to have a new album on the market in time for christmas but i dont see it happening
7010745 im against rushing an album just for the sack of meeting a deadline and for an album to be a hit over the christmas holidays it has to be on the market from november and thats just three months from now
7010746 so we will have to disappoint our fans by not releasing an album ahead of the christmas holidays but i hope they understand that what is more important is a polished album that they will enjoy
7010747 we have already started rehearsing tracks that we intend to feature on the new album and when we feel we have reached the best level we will then take the tracks to our fans at live shows
7010748 we will try and incorporate their fans input before we then take the album for recording so that effectively rules november out
7010749 we took into consideration what our fans had to say about our last video recording and we want to factor those views in the video we want to release in time for the competition
7010750 it is purely a sporting gesture in recognition of what abhinav has achieved
7010751 he clarified that this gesture did not mean that volvo had made abhinav its brand ambassador
7010752 my goal now is to be a blessing unto the people of my country by being a positive idol and role model
7010753 through utilising my talents passion experience and exposure i aim to be an ambassador of my country and an inspiration to my people my dream is to fly my flag high
7010754 i have experienced several challenges in my journey so far and i have learnt many lessons the most pertinent being that this industry is not for the faint hearted
7010755 however i am grateful for my amazing bookers from both my agencies in joburg and cape town as they are my family away from home because being away from my family and from my country is a constant challenge
7010756 this industry has taught me to be responsible and disciplined because technically you are your own boss and you can only go as far as you push yourself
7010757 its not easy going to see different clients everyday and being judged everyday
7010758 although there have been many challenges i still stand tall as a strong and proud zimbabwean woman
7010759 we have been approached by seven private players with intentions to run miss tourism zimbabwe and we had to consult widely and finally we settled for a private player name supplied but i am not in a position to disclose the name of the player at the moment
7010760 but we hope to jointly host this years edition before we relinquish the pageant to the private player next year
7010761 the pageant wont change its name because it belongs to us we will also chip in whenever we are needed
7010762 as an authority we have played our part in making the pageant popular and many people now want to be associated with the countrys top beauty contest as a result we have relinquished the running of the contest to see how other players will perform after we set a perfect example since 2005
7010763 and this year we are going to play a minimal role as we are handing over the pageant to the new player and next year zta will be completely hands off
7010764 i had complications in july and got admitted at chitungwiza central hospital where i stayed for a week
7010765 i was bleeding and i had to go to hospital where i was assured that there was nothing really bad about my situation
7010766 i also visited my doctor at the queen of peace who assured me that all was okay but then the misfortune just happened when noone expected it
7010767 when baba sharon macheso left for the sunday show i was in the finest of health but started having pains as the day progressed prompting me to rush to queen of peace hospital in hatfield to see my doctor
7010768 it was at the hospital that i had the miscarriage
7010769 it required some time for me to get used to with the new equipments
7010770 i am so unhappy for conceding such a slender margin i have to learn from the mistakes and work hard for the london event four years from now
7010771 he will need to take some stock hell need a couple of weeks the plan is for him to take stock mentally and otherwise and i have advised him he needs to get back onto the field as soon as he can

7010788 provide job training substance abuse and mental health counseling to ex offenders so that they are successfully re integrated into society

7010799 ultimately there needs to be recognition in our immigration program that there are people already in the pacific being displaced because of climate change people having to leave small atolls and islands because of sea level rises
7010800 we think there needs to be a special category in our humanitarian program that recognises the displacement caused by climate change

7010816 but ive respected the process from day one and i want to continue to do that today and allow any details about the process and final decisions to be made by senator obama and their campaign not by anybody else
7010817 i am not in that arena this is his decision and i respect him to make it however he thinks is best for him and the country

7010824 peter wellenberger was an advocate for the great bay estuary while still in college and he has grown into a national leader for research and stewardship of estuaries
7010825 his commitment to conserving habitat for fish birds and other wildlife in these rich areas where salt and freshwater mix is in keeping with the outstanding example set by dr nancy foster in her 23 years at noaa
7010826 she died way too young of cancer so its great they did this award in her honor
7010827 i thought this is a beautiful area luckily they couldnt have done it anyway they thought great bay was fresh water they needed it for cooling to do it they would have to divert the lamprey river and thats a unh water source
7010828 governor john sununu nominated us from those who had been involved in great bay
7010829 a lot of the focus recently on the bay concerns nitrogen loading and the decline of eel grass
7010830 the eel grass is not doing as well as wed like and that is a habitat concern
7010831 judd gregg has really stepped up to protect this resource i worked with his dad and have known the family a long time their support prompted me to name our new building here the hugh gregg conservation center hugh was very proactive in getting the community involved in protecting our resources
7010832 we spoke with his wife and i know he suffered several compound fractures to a leg and arm
7010833 at low tide you can smell it it smells like roofing tar
7010834 its not necessarily up front harmful but its not a good product to have in an area like that
7010835 its like solidified driveway sealant its not good for water quality but its not directly harmful to life and health
7010836 she lost control of her car and then over corrected
7010837 a few cars witnessed the accident and had stopped to try and help
7010838 he was obviously pretty excited about it but she was concerned so she followed up with the company and they said they would never do anything like that
7010839 i cant believe were home its just bizarre the whole thing is just incredible
7010840 they just took him off meds and said we dont have to come back
7010841 then she said dont be surprised if something happens in adolescence so thats always haunted us
7010842 weve been to hell and back and were so lucky to have the family we do an unbelievable network of friends the church neighbors everybody has been amazing
7010843 it was a setback but i believe i will be a better person and a better congressman because of it
7010844 ive learned to stick up for my principles and stick up for them forcibly
7010845 ive spent time criss crossing the state since 2006 and i dont get the sense that the values of new hampshires citizens have changed

7010847 the economy health care and energy are on the minds of people today
7010848 were seeing significant progress in iraq through the surge and while there are still significant problems i think this helps me in his quest to recapture his lost seat
7010849 there needs to be an increased nato presence in afghanistan
7010850 well probably need a surge of troops there but it shouldnt just be our troops
7010851 i also got an earmark passed for night vision goggles for our troops in iraq
7010852 we still have one more test to go but i think our team is extremely confident
7010853 we had a great game against them in pool play but pool play does not win a gold medal
7010854 it just gets you into the medal round we expect the same type of heart of a champion that we played against tonight in argentina
7010855 they were better than us theres nothing more to say
7010856 theyve been playing better than us the whole tournament we have to say congratulations to them
7010857 im going to try to sleep the rest of these couple of hours that we have and get ready for that game on sunday i cant wait
7010858 you want to play you want to win all of a sudden you find out all of the hard work you did is going into the trash
7010859 we had an amazing first quarter and then second quarter we started fouling too much
7010860 they slowed the game down by free throws and that was our own fault
7010861 they wanted to play physical we played physical with them and i think we beat them at their own game tonight
7010862 i think this is a harder title to win than some of those youth championships because at this level youre not going to go out there and just blow some teams away
7010863 overall the competition is better at this level in legion ball even the state tournament is tougher these kids deserve a lot of credit
7010864 i think good competition brings out the best in some kids and the competition there at the northeast regional was awesome the kids really stepped it up when they had to if they hadnt raised the level of their game we wouldnt have been able to win some of those games
7010865 the kids played great we had a great run i never thought wed get that far
7010866 but people just kept dropping them off and dropping them off
7010867 i went down to the town office and brought them a copy yesterday theyve been so helpful
7010868 in brazil theres a lot of pressure about the gold always winning
7010869 we didnt get to the final but in the end we won the bronze which is also important
7010870 its a little bit more contemporary has a little bit more edge to it not as traditional even though its still a traditional look
7010871 more feminine from the jewelry to the handbags boots are huge this year
7010872 those things the little details the accessories are going to really differentiate the look than from where weve seen it
7010873 adding the feminine details is key this year just add a color or a ruffle i think thats important

7010896 we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7010897 theyre blatantly robbing me of going into the semi finals
7010898 theres one thing i hate about this sport is that the judges can control peoples lives and can take points away and they can do whatever they want
7010899 maybe one or two judges saw it and the others did not i dont know
7010900 she kept going back she didnt get any warning point during the match
7010901 i knew it was going to be hard but i didnt think it was going be that hard
7010902 your tongue microscopically is like a shaggy carpet there are millions of filaments on your tongue that trap tiny food particles and bacteria
7010903 when you chew gum it makes you salivate and the more saliva you have in your mouth the fewer bacteria you have it not only mechanically washes bacteria out but we have antiseptic and enzymes in our saliva that kill bacteria
7010904 ive been preparing as if i was going to be the starter the whole time
7010905 unfortunately nate got hurt we never want that especially me
7010906 he completed that drill and then took himself out of the final period and watched the rest of practice from the sideline
7010907 i saw the play on film and you can tell he does something to his knee
7010908 im just as confident in roper as i was in nate costa
7010909 he was probably the star of the show in a sense
7010910 i broke a couple nice runs scored a touchdown and thats pretty much it
7010911 our offense dominated today and we held out a great portion of the defensive starters
7010912 people can only dream of doing what hes done hes basically cemented himself as a legend of track and field
7010913 i dont think any performance can top what hes done here
7010914 usain wanted to start he wanted to lay the hammer down from the start
7010915 the coaches wanted him to run the third leg we listened to the coaches
7010916 all i can say is yo jamaican sprinters taking over the world
7010917 id love for this to be a spark for the decathlon
7010918 this team has been on an amazing run and theres a lot of really good things happening
7010919 its almost magical to watch them out there theyre playing really together
7010920 hungary is going to be an incredibly tough opponent theyve got guys that have two olympic gold medals theyre going to be very difficult to beat but the way were playing its one game and for that one day we may be better than them
7010921 were playing the best team water polo ive ever played
7010922 its exciting and i think ok we go against two time gold medalists but we have a shot and for sure we feel confident
7010923 were coming back with a medal but we have a chance to change history and be the best team in u s history its possible
7010924 we all want it as bad as we have ever wanted anything in our whole lives
7010925 even though weve got the best of the best at the end of the day weve got great individual players and weve got to make them great team players
7010926 its not just kobe you can put carmelo anthony in you can put d wade in you can put chris paul in you can put jason kidd in lebron dwight howard i can keep going if you want i wish it were only kobe
7010927 we clean the capital we are treated like rubbish ourselves we demand that every cleaner on the tube get papers so that we can end the abuse of these companies they are all corrupt they have the money they could afford to treat us with dignity and respect
7010928 gives us the best opportunity to win the football game
7010929 let them go let them race if they want to get out and fight let them get out and fight the fans love that stuff
7010930 thats almost funny to hear somebody say that because i dont know that there is a tame race at bristol
7010931 tracks that drivers say they enjoy the most are tracks where we have options to pass and typically they are tracks that the fans arent too receptive to
7010932 michigan is one of the best tracks for drivers but we get spread out and theres not a lot of cautions and you have some people who think thats not good racing because there are no cautions
7010933 bristol kind of falls into that amp ellipses there are a lot of options on the track to use from a drivers standpoint bristol is much more enjoyable than it has ever been
7010934 this will be the last race i ever give up
7010935 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7010936 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7010937 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7010938 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7010939 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7010940 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7010941 we are looking at current transactions without giving you any names of developers in bangalore were looking at a transaction in delhi were looking at two transactions in calcutta one very advanced transaction with a fairly well known developer in bombay

7010956 real madrid would never want to retain a player against his wishes and as a result they have no alternative but to accept his unilateral decision to rescind his contract if that is what the player wants
7010957 i highly respect the club the players and especially the fans whove always treated me well but thats not my objective
7010958 i have an offer from chelsea which is good for me and the club i dream of playing in the english league
7010959 chelsea have a great squad and a great team my objective is to play there
7010960 ive got nothing against real madrid but i hope to resolve this situation as soon as possible
7010961 i want to be the best player in the world and that isnt possible at real madrid

7010973 here in zimbabwe farmers by and large receive concessional financing support whereas in some countries farmers cost build up include imputed land rentals or amortization charges on farm purchase that farmers get subsidised fuel
7010974 it is therefore imperative that farmers keep accurate records of their access to concessional facilities for ease of payments processing accordingly therefore the reserve bank is pleased to announce the increase in the gmb delivery bonus for commercial maize from the current 8 20 per tonne to 4 500 per tonne or 45 trillion per tonne in old currency with immediate effect the corresponding new price for seed maize is 13 500 per tonne or 135 trillion per tonne in old currency

7010984 the experience in speaker idol competition at teched sea 2008 was great it reminds me of those debating competitions that i participated when i was in high school presentation skills are something that will go a long way in your career most people have no problems giving presentation but not many can see how well they are presenting speaker idol is a good testing ground for this with the 10 minutes time limit it requires you to focus on giving the most captivate presentation that is within the attention spans of most audiences most people tend to be long winded and afraid to miss out every single detail in the presentation this risks losing the audience attention before the core message is presented

7011009 he would terminate his contract and the courts would decide what he has to pay we want robinho to stay at madrid but this situation leaves us unable to do anything
7011010 would never retain a player against his wishes so we have no alternative to accept the unilateral rescinding of his contract
7011011 he can leave as early as possible but he must accept the consequences of rescinding a contract which has two years to run
7011012 no because transfers take place when competitions are over not five days before the season starts it is a lack of respect for the club its history and the supporters

7011095 step in the right direction but the problem is that in iraq there are so many parties so many factions
7011096 the war in iraq has been long and difficult and thousands of families have paid the ultimate price during its course
7011097 the fact that an agreement between the iraqi and u s governments is so close is a reflection of the sacrifice bravery and commitment of our troops and their families our troops will be able to return having achieved real results a stable democratic iraq that can defend itself they are to be commended for their service

7011158 sixty years ago after centuries of persecution europes gypsies faced extermination under the nazis simply because of who they were
7011159 up to half a million were killed yet even after the holocaust gypsies remain perhaps the most hated minority in europe

7011161 its important for people in the traveller community and the wider community to work together a lot more
7011162 the only way its going to happen is through conferences of this kind taking place and through good media coverage of what were doing to overcome the problems
7011163 the experience of our community during the holocaust is often just completely overlooked and it shouldnt be forgotten
7011164 the more that can be done by places like the holocaust centre to keep the memory alive and to provide education about this especially in schools the better the prospects for equality

7011229 after a couple of years of wanting to collaborate with alicia keys it took james bond himself to finally make it happen
7011230 alicia put some electric energy into her breath that cemented itself into the magnetic tape very inspiring to watch
7011231 i drummed for her voice and she mimicked the guitar tones then we joined our voices and screamed and moaned about these characters in the film and their isolation having no one to trust not even themselves maybe we became them for a few minutes

7011249 i ve seen the video of their game against palace and they produced an excellent performance there and were very much in control of the game
7011250 it will be a tough on watford have players who can hurt you if you allow them space in dangerous areas tommy smith comes to the fore in that regard i think hes a terrific player
7011251 it s an exciting game we will go out and really have to get after them
7011252 we have had a good report from the specialist about joe garner
7011253 he will have a good week of training next week he will have a gentle introduction to joining in with the rest of the group
7011254 but we are probably still looking at the end of september before he is back because he effectively still has a pre season to get through
7011255 hes got great potential and im pleased arsene wenger has let him go out on loan
7011256 there were six premier league clubs yesterday morning trying to get the boy
7011257 i think in the end arsene left it to the lads decision and he wanted to come here so im delighted to have him hes a great young talent and hes come here to play
7011258 i want to see him play every week if possible and get him in the team
7011259 djibril is a good player who is capable of doing something special
7011260 if he plays games then he will score goals because that is what he has always done i think cisses game is well suited to the premier league and he will make a big impact
7011261 we need someone up front and he would bring some power to our forward line i dont know him well but when we are in the international team we have spoken and he is a good man diouf knows him more than me and they will be a very good combination as well im sure
7011262 i already feel at home at sunderland because this manager is building a team and it is exciting to be part of it i think sunderland can do something big this season
7011263 it did not surprise me to see us signing a player like cisse sunderland are a big team and we have big hopes for this new season signing cisse proves what we are trying to do here i think people are taking notice of sunderland and for a big world star to join us is another big sign
7011264 i didnt speak to boruc im totally focused on the falkirk game but once this game is out the way ill deal with it
7011265 these players crossed the limits they went outwith my boundaries and have to be punished
7011266 however its not true that i have told artur and the rest they will be out of my squad for the games thats something theyll have to wait to discover
7011267 jason and gorka will both have a role both of them played a massive role in our win over nottingham forest last weekend and i dont see it being any different throughout the season
7011268 depending on who were playing where were playing and where we are in fitness terms different individuals will be needed in different moments
7011269 gorka and jason showed what they can do in the forest game guillem bauza had a fantastic pre season and febian brandy is growing as a player all the time
7011270 gorka and jason could play together good players can do that and its a huge strength having players of their quality in the squad but there are other fantastic combinations there and now its down to the players to decide how many minutes they will play
7011271 we have different options and different ways of playing and we can change things round when we need to nobody in this squad can expect to be picked everyone knows how fierce the competition is and i dont think there is one player who takes his position for granted

7011276 wir sind gut drauf so dass es ein interessantes duell wird
7011277 we still have one more test to go but i think our team is extremely confident
7011278 we had a great game against them in pool play but pool play does not win a gold medal
7011279 it just gets you into the medal round we expect the same type of heart of a champion that we played against tonight in argentina
7011280 they were better than us theres nothing more to say
7011281 theyve been playing better than us the whole tournament we have to say congratulations to them
7011282 im going to try to sleep the rest of these couple of hours that we have and get ready for that game on sunday i cant wait
7011283 you want to play you want to win all of a sudden you find out all of the hard work you did is going into the trash
7011284 we had an amazing first quarter and then second quarter we started fouling too much
7011285 they slowed the game down by free throws and that was our own fault
7011286 they wanted to play physical we played physical with them and i think we beat them at their own game tonight
7011287 in brazil theres a lot of pressure about the gold always winning
7011288 we didnt get to the final but in the end we won the bronze which is also important

7011293 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
7011294 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother
7011295 these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
7011296 a developing fetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalizes their stress functioning
7011297 but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems

7011305 i said before i left that ireland would not be involved in a doping scandal of any nature
7011306 and unfortunately this has now become a huge embarrassment for the country
7011307 i think it is more serious for the equestrian sport and also for the horse industry in ireland because there is a vote next year on which sports will remain in the olympic programme and which will go out
7011308 so i think from what i hear from colleagues that this sport could be in serious difficulties for next years vote whether they remain in the programme or not

7011317 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7011318 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7011319 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7011320 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

7011350 now my darling husband you can see what my feet can do to you if you misbehave so i would be very good from now on i want our marriage to change from now on i think you can agree that the love and passion have gone out of our marriage hasnt it we seem to be two people simply sharing a house at the moment not really a happily married couple at all and you tiny 3inch cock has left me totally unsatisfied for years so sexually we are totally incompatible so i have come to decision divorce
7011351 well i considered divorce earlier today but after my well earned bout of sex with a younger man i decided to give you a second chance we still can be a married couple but in name only you will merely be a house husband and partner to me but sexually you will be nothing at all i will have sex lots of sex with whoever i choose but you will be denied any sexual privileges i might let you play with you 3 incher now and again and splutter out some cum when i deem you worthy of doing so but any kind of sexual intercourse will be off limits totally and if i find you have been playing around when you shouldnt have well lets just say tonight demonstration with my foot will give you and idea of what will happen to you if you misbehave hubby now is that clear
7011352 from tomorrow i will be leaving you with a list of chores to do and i expect them to be done by the time i get back home whatever time that may be and if you fail in any of your chores then i will have to punish you and im sure i dont have to tell you what that will entail will i hmmm i think you understand now get up off the floor and stand up
7011353 tonight i will be sleeping alone in our bed you can sleep on the couch i will decide tomorrow if i want you back in our marital bed for sleeping only of course now turn around

7011397 la menci n del genocidio en nuestro contexto es dificultosa de usar desde el punto de vista de los documentos internacionales
7011398 me cuesta mucho encontrar una definici n de grupo protegido para lo que sucedi en la argentina encuentro mucho m s aplicable otras definiciones de delitos de lesa humanidad que existen en el derecho internacional que son el escal n de ah muy cerca del genocidio

7011401 fay will be near or over the gulf coast of the western florida panhandle today and tonight and near or over the gulf coast of mississippi and alabama on sunday
7011402 fay is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches across the western portion of the northern florida peninsula the florida panhandle southwestern georgia and the southern half of both mississippi and alabama with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches possible
7011403 regardless of its exact track fay will be moving rather slowly during the next several days posing a significant heavy rainfall and flood hazard to a very large area
7011404 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage

7011435 we cannot subject our members to the laws of the government
7011436 fighting continued today with the military using air and ground assets apparently to get commander kato
7011437 people that are benefiting from the war in mindanao pre empted whatever good faith the government and the milf may have had by the onslaught of this violence that they have had and also by ugly prejudicial statements and actions coming from the non muslims of the area who are scared of losing whatever stakehold they might have in the bangsamoro area
7011438 can set off a chain of reprisals and only increase the danger facing civilians
7011439 fulham have a strong squad and their team look more dangerous going forwards than they did last year if you add to that it will be a derby you want a game where you have complete focus
7011440 we know the success of our season is based on how quickly we can focus again on club targets after international games
7011441 i believe that emmanuel has been unfairly treated because he had a lot of interest from many big clubs and he always told me one to one his preference was to stay in the end he stayed
7011442 that story did not come out like that in the press and unfortunately he is paying a price for a story which is not really him
7011443 he made a press conference in austria where people interpreted his statements a bit differently but i know what he told me and i know he made sacrifices to stay
7011444 i was convinced he wanted to stay but i was not always convinced he would stay because there is a big difference in that
7011445 people have advisors and some clubs pay higher wages than we do we have to accept that
7011446 would never retain a player against his wishes so we have no alternative to accept the unilateral rescinding of his contract
7011447 he can leave as early as possible but he must accept the consequences of rescinding a contract which has two years to run
7011448 no because transfers take place when competitions are over not five days before the season starts it is a lack of respect for the club its history and the supporters
7011449 dr thaksin is embarrassed about the indignity brought on all the entities the club the premier league he never intended this
7011450 dr thaksin has been really open about this he has said to me if you need me to resign from the football club as a director because it would serve the needs of the premier league then im fine with that as long as that doesnt change any other thing
7011451 i think there is a very loose term about what is fit and proper it is almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last 10 years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals
7011452 dr thaksin is in a political situation and a case that affects his assets so thats well documented so thats a hurdle
7011453 the truth of it is this club is not going to go out of business this club is not bankrupt were moving forward
7011454 it is a tricky enough game anyway but we are aware there might be a backlash from the portsmouth
7011455 we have played them a couple of times already in pre season which maybe helps a bit because it is important to get that win
7011456 the manager has a few more things to deal with with us coming back from international week but we do not want to give other teams a head start
7011457 hopefully i will be here as long as the manager wants me
7011458 it is a squad game now and i am happy here doing what i am doing
7011459 when i get in it is a case of making sure i do enough to give the manager a difficult decision to leave me out the next time that is the challenge i face every time i play
7011460 we are having a meeting next wednesday about a lot of things and contracts will be one of the things discussed

7011518 overall the competition is better at this level in legion ball even the state tournament is tougher these kids deserve a lot of credit
7011519 i think good competition brings out the best in some kids and the competition there at the northeast regional was awesome the kids really stepped it up when they had to if they hadnt raised the level of their game we wouldnt have been able to win some of those games

7011532 malinterpretamos el mensaje hab a que esperar un poco y salir al contragolpe para buscar el tercero y nosotros simplemente cuidamos lo que ten amos ese fue el error
7011533 tenemos un buen comienzo de torneo pero no hay que confiarnos como ahora que pensamos que est bamos ganando y que lo bamos a terminar as quisimos controlar el partido ya no salimos a buscar el tercer gol eso fue lo que nos mat esperemos aprender de esto y para el pr ximo partido lo tomemos en cuenta para saber que si estamos ganando debemos defender el marcador a muerte
7011534 claro que queda ese sinsabor estuvimos tan cerca de los tres puntos y de repente te encuentras con uno es un sabor amargo pero hay que verlo de manera positiva hay que pensar que este es un buen momento para tener un resultado as y que nos demos cuenta de que todos los partidos hay que lucharlos hubo momentos en donde aflojamos dejamos de proponer el partido como al principio en eso fue que nos clavaron uno despu s se agrandaron un poco y esto termina dos a dos
7011535 la verdad que estoy muy contento hab a dicho al profe jos lu s trejo antes del partido que iba a hacer un gol se lo hab a prometido por eso lo festej con l fue algo que sent antes del partido y qu bueno que se dio l stima que no pudimos ganar y que sirvi solamente para un empate pero es una alegr a personal
7011536 tigres es una filial un equipo r pido en el que hay j venes y jugadores de experiencia de local tenemos que sumar de tres para seguir en la parte alta de la tabla como hasta ahora
7011537 ser a mucho m s feliz si el estadio estuviera lleno pero bueno la obligaci n es hacerlo con gente o sin gente y tratar de ganar siempre
7011538 contento quiz por este segundo tiempo y por el empate que conseguimos pero pens ndolo y analiz ndolo fr amente hay que corregir muchas cosas es un sabor agridulce conseguir este empate estando dos goles abajo pero la realidad es que cometimos errores que no debemos de cometer si aspiramos a cosas importantes
7011539 me gust del segundo tiempo el manejo de pelota que tuvimos a pesar de ir dos goles abajo el equipo sali a proponer a correr y a jugar mano a mano en el fondo tuvimos muchas cosas que resaltar en el segundo tiempo pero tambi n muchas que corregir del segundo
7011540 la llamada de atenci n fue importante y todos reaccionamos de una gran forma y todos estamos contentos tecos repleg l neas y no busca ampliar la ventaja y es ah cuando nosotros aprovechamos y nos hacemos del bal n proponemos y buscamos de una u otra forma remontar con inteligencia y paciencia se consigui un buen resultado
7011541 entramos dormidos regalamos 45 minutos y dejamos en dos jugadas libres las marcas si queremos ser un equipo trascendente no debemos de regalar nada hay que pensar en jugar 90 minutos
7011542 fueron m s errores de nosotros que aciertos de ellos afortunadamente en el medio tiempo el equipo platic y sab amos que est bamos dejando de hacer cosas y eso se not en el segundo tiempo
7011543 fue importante la disposici n que mostramos en el segundo tiempo salimos con una actitud de sacar el resultado y al final sacamos el empate manejamos el segundo tiempo muy bien jugamos pr cticamente mano a mano y tras la expulsi n muchos dir an que nos llevar amos la derrota pero peleamos y al final conseguimos el resultado
7011544 por el gol contento pero lastimosamente regalamos dos puntos que ya ten amos en la bolsa fue un partido en el que pudimos haber ganado y nos vamos muy tristes con este empate
7011545 ten amos controlado el partido con un dos a cero en el medio tiempo para el segundo tiempo quisimos mantener esa ventaja no se pudo tambi n hay que darle m rito al rival pues necaxa hizo bien las cosas luch hasta el ltimo minuto incluso con un hombre menos pudo empatarnos
7011546 un nen em va preguntar on s el meu pare

7011550 ellos se motivaron al primer gol no bajaron los brazos
7011551 me voy enojado es un empate con sabor a derrota por la forma en que se dio sab amos que este era un partido para ganar est bamos en casa y ten amos la mesa servida pero no aprovechamos
7011552 claro que s duele a un portero un gol de ltimo minuto sobre todo por c mo se jug te deja mucha impotencia no queda m s que trabajar y cambiar el rumbo no alcanzo a ver el bal n fue por mi palo pero la verdad no lo vi porque pr cticamente me tap la barrera
7011553 est bamos bien parados y concentrados por ah necaxa nos gana en media cancha el control del esf rico y por ah ellos toman la iniciativa y cambia el rumbo del partido ellos se motivaron al primer gol no bajaron los brazos y al final sacaron un resultado positivo
7011554 un sabor a derrota duele m s el resultado como se dio si hubiera sido diferente si hubi semos pensado que el partido haya sido apretado y sacas un empate pues bueno pero duele porque ten as el partido ganado
7011555 hubo dos tiempos el primero excelente y el segundo muy malo porque tal vez se pens que ten amos ganado el partido y eso te complica dejamos crecer a un rival que pr cticamente no hab a hecho nada al sacar al ruso pens bamos en la tarjeta amarilla que ten a el rival estaba muy complicado ten amos problemas en el centro y cualquier falta hubiera generado la expulsi n y con un hombre menos nos hubiera complicado
7011556 creo que nosotros bajamos en el segundo tiempo y ah est la clave entr un poco la desconfianza y gener un desconcierto regalamos un segundo tiempo despu s de haber hecho un trabajo excelente esa era la idea de no confiarnos pero siempre pasa as es un empate digamos con sabor a derrota
7011557 hubo dos tiempos el primero excelente y el segundo muy malo porque tal vez se pens que ten amos ganado el partido y eso te complica dejamos crecer a un rival que pr cticamente no hab a hecho nada al sacar al ruso pens bamos en la tarjeta amarilla que ten a el rival estaba muy complicado ten amos problemas en el centro y cualquier falta hubiera generado la expulsi n y con un hombre menos nos hubiera complicado
7011558 creo que nosotros bajamos en el segundo tiempo y ah est la clave entr un poco la desconfianza y gener un desconcierto regalamos un segundo tiempo despu s de haber hecho un trabajo excelente esa era la idea de no confiarnos pero siempre pasa as es un empate digamos con sabor a derrota
7011559 no tuvimos una buena actitud en el sentido en que no quer amos nada con la pelota en actitud el equipo siempre la tiene en cuanto a presionar y no dejar jugar al rival pero sabemos jugar y en el primer tiempo lo demostramos y en el segundo quer amos que el tiempo pasara y eso no era lo que hab amos conversado obviamente la presi n la tendr an ellos por querer empatar o acortar la distancia y ah nosotros ten amos que jugar de otra manera y tener la pelota y llegar pues tenemos los recursos necesarios para atacar a cualquier equipo
7011560 no es cuesti n de conformismo s lo que no quer amos saber nada con la pelota se la cedimos todo el tiempo y cualquier equipo del mundo que no tenga la pelota le costar mucho generar y tener la posibilidad de defenderte con ella eso es lo ideal tener el manejo del partido como en lo restante del torneo s lo que estos fueron los peores 45 minutos que hemos tenido en este torneo
7011561 un aut ntico lacayo del gobierno espa ol y que ciu ya piensa m s en erosionar el gobierno de la generalitat que en llegar a un buen acuerdo de financiaci n

7011582 van de meeste teksten bestond lange tijd maar n exemplaar dat als een soort moederkopie werd bewaard en als instructie diende voor andere schrijvers die dat materiaal dan weer mondeling doorgaven om de veertig jaar moesten er nieuwe kopie n gemaakt worden omdat het materiaal versleten was dat was dan meteen het moment om onder priesterlijke goedkeuring de teksten te reviseren doorgaans was de hoofdschriftgeleerde de opperschrijver in de tempel van jeruzalem verantwoordelijk voor een nieuwe tekstredactie

7011609 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
7011610 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7011611 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
7011612 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
7011613 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7011614 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7011615 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
7011616 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
7011617 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
7011618 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
7011619 if you trust every web site but not a government
7011620 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official is it possible that all news on the internet is accurate
7011621 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
7011622 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
7011623 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
7011624 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates

7011650 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura

7011656 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7011657 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7011658 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7011659 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7011660 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7011661 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7011662 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7011663 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7011664 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7011665 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7011666 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7011667 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7011668 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7011669 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7011670 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7011671 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7011672 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7011673 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7011674 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7011675 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7011676 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7011677 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7011678 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7011679 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7011680 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7011681 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7011682 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7011683 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7011684 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7011685 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7011686 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7011687 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7011688 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7011689 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7011690 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7011691 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7011692 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7011693 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

7011697 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del

7011700 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7011701 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7011702 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7011703 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7011704 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7011705 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7011706 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7011707 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7011708 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7011709 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7011710 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7011711 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7011712 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7011713 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7011714 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7011715 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7011716 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7011717 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7011718 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7011719 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7011720 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7011721 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7011722 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7011723 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7011724 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7011725 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7011726 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7011727 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7011728 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7011729 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7011730 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7011731 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

7011745 tsvangirai azosaina here haana kusaina uyo ko chiiko chinonetsa pakungoti kwe e kwe e ko inga mutambara napresident vakasaina wani
7011746 discovered that there is a very strong view that if tsvangirais signature is the one that will save the country then he should be accorded the power that is commensurate with the power of his signature
7011747 the power of tsvangirais signature should come with responsibility and therefore requires necessary say in the major decisions in the government that will obtain in zimbabwe because people should be able to measure his contribution
7011748 who are the people that are meant to benefit from these signatures
7011749 the question for tsvangirai is does he go into the theatre without enough tools or go in and ask for the tools once he is inside
7011750 tsvangirai should not underestimate his power even without all the tools he wants his presence in the theatre will make a difference to the lives of the people of zimbabwe much more than he might imagine
7011751 it will take his creativity imagination and initiative it cannot be disputed that mr tsvangirais role in the future government should reflect the power of his signature
7011752 judging by the conduct of mr tsvangirai i have no doubt that zimbabweans are a determined people
7011753 but daddy how would we be heard by the world if we do not speak in english

7011774 im prinzip haben wir in den letzten rennen gemerkt dass sich die kurvengeschwindigkeit dramatisch erh ht hat
7011775 in laguna seca war die h chstgeschwindigkeit auf der langen geraden fast die selbe wie vergangenes jahr aber die rundenzeiten waren trotzdem 1 6 sekunden schneller es ist wichtig zu merken dass wir die kurvengeschwindigkeiten sukzessive gesteigert haben
7011776 das macht die arbeit die wir gemeinsam mit der sicherheitskommission in die streckensicherheit investieren immer schwieriger
7011777 ich habe von den promotern geh rt dass es wichtig ist dar ber zu reden genau wie damals als wir durch den schritt von 990 ccm auf 800 ccm die h chstgeschwindigkeit gesenkt haben jetzt haben wir eben dieses problem wir haben festgestellt dass die kurvengeschwindigkeiten dramatisch angestiegen sind
7011778 deswegen haben wir die sicherheit an den strecken stark verbessert dar ber haben wir im meeting der sicherheitskommission am freitag gesprochen weil dieses thema jedoch von gr ter wichtigkeit ist haben wir uns dazu entschlossen es noch einmal mit allen fahrern zu diskutieren
7011779 aus diesem grund trafen wir die fahrer heute bei einem weiteren meeting ich stellte ihnen das problem vor und sie diskutierten es und entwickelten einige ideen die jetzt der grand prix commission gpc pr sentiert werden um das problem zu l sen
7011780 wir werden dies der gpc pr sentieren die leiten es dann an die fim msma und die dorna weiter so wird jedermann dar ber diskutieren die promoter haben schon 80 millionen euro in die sicherheit investiert gegenw rtig stecken sie mehr 1 7 millionen euro mehr in die sicherheit als noch vor drei jahren
7011781 so kann es nicht weitergehen ist es n tig immer schneller und schneller zu fahren nein das ist es nicht
7011782 sie haben dar ber debattiert aber wir k nnen noch nicht bekannt geben was da rausgekommen ist wir haben beschlossen dass wir das ergebnis an die msma weiterleiten werden nicht an die presse
7011783 in diesem meeting ging es um die sicherheit der fahrer die reduzierung auf nur einen reifenhersteller k nnte eine l sung sein aber das w re keine l sung welche zwangsl ufig zu mehr sicherheit f hren w rde
7011784 es ist unm glich das jedes jahr zu tun die strecken haben nicht genug geld jedes jahr alles neu zu berbauen
7011785 wir haben ber sicherheit gesprochen weil das die wichtigste sache berhaupt ist
7011786 es ist wirklich schwierig die strecken noch sicherer zu machen
7011787 jedes jahr fragen wir nach mehr auslaufzonen und wenn wir das tun geben die streckenbetreiber mehr als 80 millionen euro f r die sicherheit aus dieses jahr haben wir in jerez nach mehr auslaufzonen und einem neuen streckenbelag gefragt jerez hat all das getan und 1 7 millionen euro investiert
7011788 es ist unm glich das jedes jahr zu tun die strecken haben nicht genug geld jedes jahr alles neu zu berbauen daher m ssen wir versuchen andere gute l sungen zu finden um nicht langsamer aber sicherer zu fahren wir haben schon einige ideen mehr kann ich dar ber aber nicht sagen
7011789 carmelo sagte dass die sicherheit zu einem problem geworden ist weil wir viel an den strecken t fteln diese geben einen haufen geld aus was eine gute sache ist aber momentan m ssen wir jahr f r jahr die auslaufzonen verbessern das bedeutet dass die strecken jedes jahr tiefer in die taschen greifen m ssen also sagen einige hey jedes jahr wird es mehr geld
7011790 wir m ssen uns also etwas einfallen lassen um ein wenig langsamer durch die kurven zu fahren am freitag hat carmelo uns also chris vermeulen anm d red loris und marco meldandri anm d red so in der sicherheitskommission gesagt
7011791 aber wir waren der meinung dass es besser ist mit allen fahrern dar ber zu beraten daher haben wir mit jedem gesprochen und wir haben schon ein paar ideen wie wir die geschwindigkeit etwas senken k nnen aber ich wei nicht was daraus wird man muss das auch mit den anderen herstellern besprechen

7011800 obviously it wasnt very nice but i wasnt expecting cheers
7011801 i wasnt happy in there at all i was never myself i think it was because i knew so much from the outside
7011802 for me to be in there as rexs girlfriend was very difficult
7011803 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7011804 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7011805 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7011806 today there are a few stories floating around about why advertising which seems like the natural and possibly only way for social networks to make money isnt working out so well techdirt and businessweek both cover advertising on popular social networks and reasons why users just arent jumping to click those ads
7011807 techdirt reminds us of long standing deals that make social networks into ad publishers for search engines namely microsoft facebook and google myspace
7011808 businessweek is also focusing on the failure of ads on myspace
7011809 bw points out that myspaces division saw an 87 surge in q4 2007 but taken with techdirts points this may only prove that the only people profiting from social network advertising are the networks themselves
7011810 found that social networking inventory is not monetizing as well as expected

7011815 i think i can honestly say that if it comes to january the chances are he wont be staying but i dont think it will get there
7011816 until the last day of the billing period ending during september 2009
7011817 it was a dream game all i could think of was thank god the ball went over the line and now thanks to that i have a gold medal
7011818 we didnt play our best football today but this victory is a good one for us
7011819 the fact that we have been to the athletes village and met famous sportsmen its all an experience that we will not forget quickly
7011820 messi terrorises not only our team but all teams in europe he didnt score but he created a lot of their chances that is why we have the silver and they have the gold
7011821 were very disappointed but it means we came second in the olympic games we had a lot of good scoring chances but you have to score goals to win the gold medal
7011822 there still might be one more player to come in
7011823 we have a short squad and we cant afford injuries like other clubs its fine when everyone is fit
7011824 i signed silvestre because he was the kind of player who can complete our team in every aspect of what we needed a left footed player experience at the back and some maturity as well
7011825 the thinking is that he has a great team attitude and we are a bit light in terms of experience in the dressing room so he can help us on that front
7011826 we have to make sure we do not make calamitous defensive errors and that arsenal have to work hard for their goals
7011827 whenever you play against the top four you know you are in for a tough game but we have to believe we can get a result
7011828 im just focusing now on getting my fitness levels back up to 100 per cent
7011829 after that we will see what players the manager brings in during the transfer market and what my role in the team could be
7011830 but this will be my second season at liverpool and hopefully i can take my game to the next level
7011831 we have a lot of exciting attacking players we know we can hurt teams when we attack but we also need to get it right defensively
7011832 its difficult to know where teams will end up this season but we have high expectations and playing these two teams will provide a good yardstick
7011833 when im in this uniform when im with people in uniform i could go tomorrow
7011834 but when im home in civilian life its harder i have every imaginable comfort
7011835 i have faith in my battle buddies and training to successfully make it back in a year
7011836 i love being a part of my family it hasnt hit me yet it probably wont until i get on the plane or step onto the sand for the first time i will miss everyone but it will be ok i have to make the best opportunity out of the situation there will be high points and low points but you can say that about anything in life
7011837 i look at it alarmed at times because of what can be happening
7011838 were in the same boat as a lot of other families i look at her and it makes me proud of her i cant even fathom what shes doing
7011839 you always say when your kids are in pain or something along those lines you want to trade places with them
7011840 i thought she was going back to school i felt anxiety fear regret sadness and concern
7011841 the thought of what could happen you read about it every day its reality you cant escape it but my little girl has grown up and will go out to protect our country

7011845 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7011846 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago
7011847 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone
7011848 we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7011849 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7011850 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7011851 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience

7011853 oncology nurses are on the front lines providing education and support to help patients manage cancer diagnoses and treatment
7011854 this survey shows that as oncology nurses we need to adopt a zero tolerance policy to manage the nausea and vomiting that affect our patients lives
7011855 communication is the most important factor when dealing with the side effects of chemotherapy its critical to let your health care team know what side effects youre having and whether or not the treatments youre on are working
7011856 many factors can contribute to feeling nauseous and sick during chemo so maintaining an ongoing dialogue with your doctor or nurse can really help
7011857 under the cover of needing to deliver humanitarian goods nato countries continue to boost their naval grouping
7011858 in addition to the spanish and german frigates that entered the black sea basin on august 21 yesterday a polish frigate and a destroyer of the us navy passed the bosphorous
7011859 i dont think that this will help stabilise the situation in the region
7011860 to me it is very intimidating to do it this way
7011861 it could easily be construed they are trying to get no answers at all it certainly doesnt make me very comfortable the truth is being ascertained
7011862 well ask them about the checks that were conducted and whether or not they asked for them approved of them things of that nature
7011863 to me it would be a lot less invasive and create a lot less anxiety if they received a written response first
7011864 this just raises more questions about the processes and procedures
7011865 zoek nooit het geluk want je zoekt je een ongeluk

7011870 a escolha do candidato a vice uma mensagem para o povo norte americano a respeito do tipo de governo que se vai ter com cada candidato
7011871 mccain tem tido dificuldade em convencer os mais conservadores a apoiarem ele enquanto obama tem tido dificuldades com os democratas mais moderados a escolha do vice pode facilitar a conquista de p blicos que n o se decidiram ainda entre os dois candidatos
7011872 ele pode significar a conquista de um estado chave que vai representar a conquista da presid ncia
7011873 ao longo do ltimo s culo f cil perceber que os vices foram cada vez mais influentes e muitas vezes foram indicados para suceder o presidente anterior
7011874 ele sem d vida foi um dos vice presidentes mais influentes da hist ria dos estados unidos por n o ter ambi es eleitorais muito grandes ele tomou para si as decis es menos populares do governo bush com isso ele acabou sendo uma figura realmente pouco popular na pol tica norte americana foi ele que nos levou guerra do iraque por exemplo
7011875 a relev ncia do vice presidente no governo depende de como for feita a escolha mccain disse que quer escolher um vice que tenha foco em quest es econ micas enquanto obama parece estar mais focado na escolha de um vice que o ajude a vencer a elei o

7011879 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7011880 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7011881 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7011882 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7011883 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7011884 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7011885 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7011886 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

7011889 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7011890 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7011891 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7011892 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7011893 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7011894 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7011895 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7011896 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7011897 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7011898 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7011899 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7011900 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7011901 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7011902 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7011903 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7011904 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7011905 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7011906 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7011907 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7011908 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7011909 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7011910 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7011911 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7011912 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7011913 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7011914 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7011915 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7011916 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7011917 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7011918 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7011919 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7011920 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7011921 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7011922 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7011923 babylegs protect crawling babies knees and keep little legs warm especially the often exposed skin between the sock and the bottom of the pant or skirt
7011924 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7011925 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

7011967 its gonna be an awesome party with more than 7 things i like
7011968 its gonna be totally awesome i hope its a great time
7011969 i only turn 16 once so its going to be an awesome party with my favorite rides hanging out with friends fireworks and more ill even get to sing a couple songs
7011970 the best part of the party is were going to recognize some really cool kids from youth service america who are giving back to their community thats so awesome because i think its really important for kids like us to volunteer
7011971 i took part in a photo shoot that was supposed to be artistic and now seeing the photographs and reading the story i feel so embarrassed i never intended for any of this to happen and i apologize to my fans who i care so deeply about
7011972 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7011973 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7011974 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7011975 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7011976 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7011977 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7011978 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7011979 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7011980 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7011981 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7011982 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7011983 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7011984 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7011985 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7011986 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7011987 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7011988 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7011989 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7012001 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7012002 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

7012021 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
7012022 i wasnt aware of it i saw him at the hall of fame and he said he was feeling fine
7012023 he looked a little thinner than usual but he never indicated to me that he was struggling with anything

7012102 the coro transaction represents a strategic investment in a company with a proven management team working in two countries where we have political confidence chile and argentina and a commodity copper which we believe has strong fundamentals going forward

7012137 you can never underestimate just how significant music and arts can be in helping children learn and solve complex problems
7012138 it is the responsibility of all educators to teach literacy and numeracy and the arts play a key role in doing that
7012139 its wonderful to see someone who loves teaching music became a department chair where she can make a difference
7012140 i hope to continue the growth in both numbers of students who benefit from the arts and program quality in course offerings experiences and accessibility
7012141 more and more students are becoming involved in festivals and art competitions enhancing their learning process and often providing a sense of belonging and a feeling of connection to their school and community thats why i love arts and i want all my students to share this passion
7012142 i had no idea that i was even nominated i was shocked
7012143 being able to communicate a series of thoughts and ideas to someone is what i enjoy most about teaching and writing

7012154 the residents are looking forward to being able to help the community
7012155 they want to plan at garage sale at the home
7012156 we want to help them get started then theyll decide what community service project they might want to fund
7012157 and hes been sending me birthday cards every year hes never missed
7012158 and why wouldnt you think someone often receiving all this good will wouldnt want to feel that same sense of satisfaction from helping people
7012159 and were not helping them as advisors were enabling them to help others

7012161 im a runner myself and i was running with some friends a couple of weeks ago and i was like i wish i could bring my joy of running to school
7012162 i was thinking about a lot of the students i have and i know a lot of them go home and sit in front of the tv or play video games
7012163 by the second day my kids were requesting to go back outside and do their laps which was great
7012164 by the end of the liberty run we had a good 98 percent of the classrooms participating
7012165 it became a really nice program for the entire school it made the summer fly by but it made it that much more fun for all of us
7012166 you can just walk around and see new stuff im going to start walking more because its better and healthier
7012167 i really didnt anticipate it being such a big school event im really happy with the outcome and how enthusiastic the kids seem to be
7012168 it was just a fabulous success to have staff members model the walking and running with the students
7012169 it created a sense of connection in each classroom that they were all doing that together
7012170 they were aware of the olympics and they wanted to do something similar to the olympics
7012171 of course running and walking is something everybody can do and the marathon is the key of the olympics

7012200 but patterson saw enough from his players after they were reduced to ten at wrexham to encourage him greatly and picked out keeper jake cole who had his best game to date since joining on loan from qpr
7012201 to have that sending off so early it killed the game for us
7012202 we did a 4 4 1 to stabilise things and that worked pretty well i was disappointed with their headed goal but other than that they didnt really create any thing
7012203 we knew they were going to have chances but they were all from long distance
7012204 i thought our goalkeeper was outstanding hes a young man and he didnt deserve to be on the losing side with that performance
7012205 jai t surpris dapprendre par voie de presse que mon nom tait inscrit au nombre des soutiens de sin dans le conflit quil a avec sa r daction en chef

7012218 i will take a decision after talking to ministers who won the elections as independent in ranchi
7012219 i will announce my decision anyhow today either in the evening or at night
7012220 it is not a personal issue that i alone can make a decision all the independents will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision
7012221 when the upa government was formed earlier in jharkhand independents were first taken into confidence this time it was just opposite
7012222 no proposal for a better leadership was put before us or there were no convincing arguments given here as to why a change of leadership in required in jharkhand at all

7012225 at the instance of congress leaders most of the poll officials acted in a partisan manner deleted the names of eligible voters supporting the opposition parties and included bogus voters to suit the ruling party
7012226 due to the interference of many ruling party mlas and ministers the concerned authorities are not in a position to discharge their duties impartially
7012227 congress led upa government had meekly surrendered before the separatist demands and has completely messed up and unnecessarily complicated the entire issue
7012228 besides separatists demanding azadi liberation must be dealt with a firm hand and india should send a strong message to pakistan not to interfere in its internal affairs
7012229 it shows congress is guided by votebank politics despite pdp taking anti india stand history will hold congress responsible for bungling with jammu and kashmir

7012233 lembaga zakat sangat pas untuk membantu masyarakat miskin hanya saja saat ini masalah kepercayaan terhadap lembaga amil zakat ini membuat masyarakat ragu untuk menyalurkan zakatnya
7012234 hal ini bisa dimengerti karena di masa orde baru dulu lembaga amil zakat memang dinilai kurang amanah
7012235 setiap pns di kota bandung harus menyisihkan sebagian hartanya bagi anak yatim jika hal itu dilakukan maka banyak anak yang dhuaffa terbantu kehidupannya
7012236 lembaga zakat yang saya kelola sudah bagus mungkin nanti saya akan buka lembaga sosial lagi seperti persoalan air misalnya pokoknya saya akan menjadi penggerak sosial

7012251 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7012252 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7012253 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7012254 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7012255 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7012256 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7012257 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7012258 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7012259 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7012260 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7012261 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7012262 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7012263 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7012264 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7012265 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7012266 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7012267 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7012268 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7012269 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7012270 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7012271 if the conclusions contradict the word of god the conclusions are wrong no matter how many scientific facts may appear to back them
7012272 scientific explanation of the biblical locust grasshopper plague in egypt
7012273 the people who have prepared this book have tried consistently to put the word of god first and science second
7012274 we do not intend to argue the case based on proving animus
7012275 the untimely expert witness reports excluded as untimely acsi had no admissible evidence that any of the four actually five courses were unreasonably rejected
7012276 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7012277 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7012278 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7012279 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7012280 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7012281 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7012282 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7012283 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7012284 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7012285 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7012286 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7012287 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7012288 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7012289 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7012290 i can either be a guy who writes novels or i can be a guy who answers emails realizing i cannot be both ive made my decision and now i can live with it
7012291 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7012292 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7012293 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7012294 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7012295 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7012296 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7012297 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7012298 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7012299 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7012300 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7012301 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7012302 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7012303 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7012304 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7012305 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7012306 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7012307 this is a planning took where all things are going
7012308 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7012309 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7012310 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7012311 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7012312 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7012313 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7012314 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7012315 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7012316 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7012317 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7012318 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7012319 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7012320 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7012321 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7012322 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7012323 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7012324 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7012325 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7012326 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7012327 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7012328 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7012329 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7012330 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7012331 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7012332 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7012333 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7012334 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7012335 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7012336 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7012337 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7012338 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7012339 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7012340 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7012341 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7012342 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7012343 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7012344 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7012345 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7012346 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7012347 true friendship is like sound health the value of it is seldom known until it be lost
7012348 each friend represents a world in us a world possibly not born until they arrive and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born
7012349 a real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out
7012350 a friend is one who walks in when others walk out
7012351 a friend is someone who is there for you when hed rather be anywhere else
7012352 dont walk in front of me i may not follow dont walk behind me i may not lead walk beside me and be my friend
7012353 every person is a new door to a different world
7012354 it takes a long time to grow an old friend
7012355 no love no friendship can cross the path of our destiny without leaving some mark on it forever
7012356 its the friends you can call up at 4am that matter
7012357 friend a person known well to another and regarded with liking affection and loyalty
7012358 a new friendship is like an unripened fruit it may become either an orange or a lemon
7012359 anybody can sympathize with the sufferings of a friend but it requires a very fine nature to sympathize with a friends success
7012360 those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new hatchd unfledgd comrade
7012361 friendship with oneself is all important because without it one cannot be friends with anyone else in the world
7012362 if you judge people you have no time to love them
7012363 i will speak ill of no man and speak all the good i know of everybody
7012364 grief can take care of itself but to get the full value of joy you must have somebody to divide it with
7012365 thus nature has no love for solitude and always leans as it were on some support and the sweetest support is found in the most intimate friendship

7012385 the election commission on friday set september 6 as the date lawmakers will elect a new president after the resignation earlier this week of president pervez musharraf
7012386 the senior party in pakistans governing coalition on friday nominated asif ali zardari widower of former prime minister benazir bhutto as its candidate in elections for president the announcement of the election date came a day after twin suicide attacks outside the countrys biggest weapons factory complex in wah 20 miles north of the capital islamabad
7012387 he has one of the worlds most dangerous jobs turning back the seemingly unstoppable tide of and taliban linked jihadi militancy sweeping across nuclear armed pakistan
7012388 and rehman malik photo above as we talk in his islamabad office makes it clear that the days of pussyfooting in pakistans fight against the militants are over
7012389 either we can hand this country over to the taliban or we can fight i am going to fight under malik pakistans policy has been transformed from one of retreat to pursuit of and the taliban but his tough rhetoric has also him a target of islamic militants
7012390 the suave 57 year old one time boss of pakistans federal investigation agency the equivalent of the australian federal police is an increasingly controversial figure as he takes pakistans war into areas it has previously avoided
7012391 in the few short weeks since malik and prime minister gilani returned from the white house pakistans much vaunted role in the war against terrorism has been transformed
7012392 suddenly and with little fanfare islamabads security forces are aggressively on the offensive in key areas where for months if not years the government had virtually given up leaving the militants to set up sharia courts
7012393 benazir bhutto appointed rehman malik as chief of the federal investigation agency fia which then launched a secret war against the taliban supporters in pakistan which amounted to a direct attack on the inter services intelligence isi
7012394 the pakistani military was equally dismayed by reports of fia contacts with the israeli secret service the mossad which had been cooperating with indian secret service raw to investigate taliban supporters
7012395 the blast at the transformer station did not influence on supplying close properties with electricity

7012400 john mccain remains wedded to the bush administrations myopic view of a world defined by terrorism its time for a fundamental change but thats going to require more than a great soldier its going to require a wise leader
7012401 we cannot keep treading water without exhausting ourselves and more importantly doing great damage to our other vital interests around the world and at home and thats exactly what president bush and a president mccain would be asking us to do

7012416 quite frankly our youth dont see enough men making an outward effort to uplift the community so were looking to be that example to be that outward effort to hopefully uplift the community and influence some of these young people to join us and have a positive influence on our community

7012451 we are deeply disappointed and when a decision was to be made on sunday we think south africa made a hasty choice
7012452 after extensive discussions and a frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
7012453 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
7012454 tough on seagulls and tough on the causes of seagulls
7012455 seagulls are a menace to scottish towns and cities they thrive on litter and their aggressive behaviour towards other birds pets and even people is increasingly problematic dumfries has a particular problem with gulls with regular reports of divebombing
7012456 i even read this week about a young paperboy who has had to abandon his deliveries due to constant attacks from the birds
7012457 you find these gulls making territorial noises in the middle of the night

7012459 the dead include 24 children most of them belonging to the families of saharias tribals though the first death was reported july 25 the health department officials have still not woken up
7012460 firstly the doctors are rarely available in the only district hospital in shivpuri even when they are present they simply refer the patient to gwalior 125 km from shivpuri district headquarters
7012461 since most of the localities from where the outbreak of malaria have been reported are inhabited by poor tribals they cant take the patient to gwalior
7012462 so far only 30 deaths have occurred due to various diseases

7012464 millions are watching on television in britain and the enthusiasm and joy of the olympic events is rising every day so that when the team returns on monday they will have tremendous reception and ovation from the whole of the british people
7012465 we are proud of what we have achieved but we are also proud of the way that we have achieved it
7012466 we can confirm the deaths of four british nationals in a road traffic accident on august 20 we are still seeking clarification about the accident from the south african authorities
7012467 mark viduka will probably be a couple of weeks still because unlike michael owen he missed the end of last season as well and unlike michael he has had an injection in his achilles
7012468 it will be a little bit longer for him but he is close he came back into training two days this week and was absolutely outstanding so it wont be long
7012469 claudio cacapa has not trained with us i was going to involve him at old trafford maybe play him but on the friday he just tweaked his hamstring
7012470 but he is not far off being fit again because it didnt go he just got a warning he had had one the week before so we just eased back on it
7012471 i would say another two weeks and he will be back
7012472 what we have got to do with joey is just try to assess where his fitness is
7012473 it is all right to come in and play a game but how will he react after it
7012474 i dont look at personal records but i do look at winning things which have never been done before
7012475 no one had won three premier league titles on the run and we did that but four hasnt and no one has ever retained the champions league those are the targets this season thats the challenge
7012476 we certainly have the potential to do three and then four its all about whether you have the hunger and desire because weve proved we have the quality
7012477 ive heard little bits about the new coach thinking of asking me but i havent spoken to him
7012478 a couple of years ago i did think about coming out of international retirement i spoke to steve mcclaren a couple of times about it when he became the new coach i considered it quite strongly
7012479 but i came to the conclusion i had made the right decision in the first place and i didnt want to go back
7012480 when steve was appointed he asked me to return just the fact the england manager had rung me to come back and play for my country meant a lot to me
7012481 he didnt have to do that but he also came down to training and asked if i fancied it it wasnt about not thinking it was too much or i wasnt capable it was just the fact when i was playing i wasnt enjoying it one little bit
7012482 so i thought the time was right to get out and i finally decided it wasnt right to go back into it all again
7012483 as long as i feel im still contributing to united ill carry on
7012484 im sure the manager will say something as well if he turns around to me and says i am not doing enough any more then fair enough that will be it
7012485 its all about working my socks off in training and doing extra sessions to improve my game
7012486 hopefully that means it will all come together when i do get a chance on the pitch i know ill get a chance and its up to me to take it
7012487 it was nice to get the goal last weekend i played against accrington but other than that my chances have been limited so far
7012488 it was my first goal at molineux which was nice hopefully i can kick on now and get a few more
7012489 at plymouth i wasnt even on the bench and obviously you always want to be involved i want to make sure my performance levels dont drop because i need to be at the top of my game for when the chance comes
7012490 since i was 18 ive been pretty much first choice its only three or four years ago that i was last fighting for a place when i was at shrewsbury
7012491 since then ive been pretty much a regular even though there was competition
7012492 neil is letting things settle down i would hope that after the next international break he will have been training for a while and will be available
7012493 it might be sooner than that but if i was sticking on the side of caution i would say hed be back in a few weeks the international break might do him good
7012494 its tough for neil as it was for robert koren who came back super fit and spent some time getting into great shape during the summer
7012495 then they both picked up injuries neil worked extremely hard to get himself in great shape and its disappointing that they got injured
7012496 but that is part and parcel of being a footballer and you need the mental toughness to overcome that hopefully when they are fit and ready and raring to go they can force their way back into the team
7012497 it is no secret that they are a very physical team and we are used to playing them
7012498 they are pretty intimidating but we are trying every thing we can to be ready for them just when you think that if you can keep one down keep tabs on donaghy up comes another one into the full forward line tommy walsh has just made our job even harder
7012499 it is going to be a massive fight there is going to be a lot of breaking ball and it makes life hard for the defenders having a big man there
7012500 no full back wants to see high ball being raked in on top of him the best way to stop it is to stop quality ball coming in because if they do get it you saw the last day against galway that they notched 1 21 when they got quality ball
7012501 it probably has taken me time to gel to the position but id be a natural defender
7012502 as a midfielder i would be more defensive i got a few trial games there this year and am used to it now the last couple of games have been good but that does not mean im going to play well on sunday
7012503 i think that is pretty much our own fault because of how we have acquitted ourselves against kerry in crucial games
7012504 we did ourselves no favours by losing emphatically on all those occasions and thats maybe the reason why
7012505 ive heard little bits about the new coach thinking of asking me but i havent spoken to him
7012506 a couple of years ago i did think about coming out of international retirement i spoke to steve mcclaren a couple of times about it when he became the new coach i considered it quite strongly
7012507 but i came to the conclusion i had made the right decision in the first place and i didnt want to go back

7012510 so i thought the time was right to get out and i finally decided it wasnt right to go back into it all again
7012511 as long as i feel im still contributing to united ill carry on
7012512 im sure the manager will say something as well if he turns around to me and says i am not doing enough any more then fair enough that will be it
7012513 it is no secret that they are a very physical team and we are used to playing them

7012556 would never retain a player against his wishes so we have no alternative to accept the unilateral rescinding of his contract
7012557 he can leave as early as possible but he must accept the consequences of rescinding a contract which has two years to run

7012572 el dolor cr nico afecta a una proporci n mayor de mujeres que de hombres pero desafortunadamente las mujeres tambi n son menos propensas a recibir tratamiento en comparaci n con los varones debido a barreras culturales econ micas y pol ticas
7012573 en general las mujeres reciben menos tratamiento analg sico debido en parte a que en la mujer el dolor suele ser atribuido a factores psicol gicos considerados menos o directamente no relevantes
7012574 hay estudios que han mostrado que las mujeres tienen m s dolor recurrente dolor m s severo y dolor por m s tiempo

7012576 muchos s ndromes de dolor aparecen o desaparecen asociados a cambios hormonales despu s de la pubertad por ejemplo la aparici n de muchos de estos s ndromes se incrementa en las mujeres pero no en los varones
7012577 hay estudios que sugieren que la analgesia inducida por el estr s que es la forma natural en que el organismo reacciona ante el estr s podr a estar suprimida por los estr genos se alaron weissbrod y stronski asimismo cambios hormonales como los del ciclo menstrual el embarazo o la menopausia intervienen en la modulaci n del dolor
7012578 que las hormonas juegan un rol importante ha sido ya demostrado a trav s de distintos estudios en los que se observ que cambiar los niveles de hormonas en sangre en hombres y en mujeres cambia tambi n la frecuencia de aparici n de s ndromes como los dolores de cabeza

7012679 he is pleased to be back in this country because for the first time he can appear before a court of justice
7012680 he tells me that his trial in vietnam a country which has been condemned by virtually every organisation concerned with justice and human rights was a charade was a travesty of justice
7012681 mr gadd has demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
7012682 unfortunately the court didnt agree with my submission that it should hear me on the issue about the unfairness of how he has been treated by the vietnamese system
7012683 that was an opportunity that i sought to take on his behalf but the court decided it did not want to hear
7012684 therefore this morning there has been no opportunity before an impartial tribunal to put forward why it was he was innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted in vietnam there may be another opportunity in the future its too early to tell
7012685 mr gadd wants me to say to you that he did not commit the offences for which he was convicted it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his defence forward
7012686 ultimately he wants that to be tested if he can before the courts of this country

7012739 a species of red algae for instance produces under increased ultraviolet radiation less red light harvesting proteins thus decreasing the absorption of radiation the typical red colour of the alga fades and the plant gets white tips
7012740 the algae additionally produce substances which react similar to melanin in human skins mycosporin amino acids maa
7012741 we examine the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation on algae and their protective mechanisms

7012751 seagulls are a menace to scottish towns and cities they thrive on litter and their aggressive behaviour towards other birds pets and even people is increasingly problematic dumfries has a particular problem with gulls with regular reports of divebombing
7012752 i even read this week about a young paperboy who has had to abandon his deliveries due to constant attacks from the birds
7012753 you find these gulls making territorial noises in the middle of the night
7012754 some people are not concerned about it other people might be experiencing bad health effects from it so i think theres a legitimate cause to control gulls in certain circumstances under the terms of the law

7012776 the emphasis still is on the economic and market risks but still trying to walk a fine line on inflation as well

7012778 is committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary to attain that objective
7012779 add to this mix a jump in inflation in part the product of a global commodity boom and the result has been one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory

7012854 the bottom line here is that polar bears need sea ice
7012855 the sea ice is decaying and the bears are in very serious trouble for any people who are still non believers in global warming and the impacts it is having in the arctic this should answer their doubts once and for all
7012856 to find so many polar bears at sea at one time is extremely worrisome because it could be an indication that as the sea ice on which they live and hunt continues to melt many more bears may be out there facing similar risk
7012857 my goal with this entry is to brush a big picture of where linux stands as far as photography is concerned
7012858 for many developing countries avoiding deforestation is pretty much the only way they can engage in the climate change regime and reap some benefits
7012859 we think this is particularly relevant to africa we want this next climate regime to benefit africa
7012860 we shall perhaps see a new dawn for tropical forests
7012861 a levy of that level is about 0 6 percent of an airfare price
7012862 this is about rural communities and indigenous peoples this is about business we have got to bring communities and the private sector together
7012863 all we are asking is that we slow down to make sure these projects dont do irreparable harm to our shrinking desert
7012864 the southwest is not a big flat empty parking lot
7012865 we cant push this off for 10 20 or 30 years
7012866 is the wrong signal to send to solar power developers and to nevadans and westerners who need and want clean affordable sun powered electricity soon
7012867 you have folks who have been at war for decades who are saying wait a minute
7012868 you have the ohvers and sierra clubbers on kind of the same page
7012869 until the technology changes and they can put the solar collectors into the rocks and cliffs it will impact desert tortoise
7012870 that will be a huge issue itself determining how much impact we can tolerate to these desert species
7012871 we need renewable energy but we also need healthy lands
7012872 you are talking about hundreds and thousands of drilling pads in wyoming and colorado and elsewhere we are talking about dozens of solar projects at most that i expect to see at the end of this process
7012873 solar utilities need certainty wind developers coal nuclear you name it they all want certainty in their planning and regulatory process and at the end of the day i think the peis process will provide even greater certainty
7012874 we will have to make compromises like putting wind turbines in beautiful places
7012875 however political commercials and films which are dramatized and made to distort issues or create a slanted impression should not be allowed

7012877 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7012878 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7012879 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7012880 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7012881 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7012882 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7012883 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

7012893 as much as half of the water used to grow food globally may be lost or wasted
7012894 curbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win win opportunities for farmers business ecosystems and the global hungry an effective water saving strategy requires that minimising food wastage is firmly placed on the political agenda

7012926 ich will unterhalten und das publikum dabei auch zum nachdenken anregen
7012927 ich war in filmen immer einer von den typen die nur auf den unteren decks der marine ihrer majest t mitspielen durften ich hatte ein so pausb ckiges gesicht dass ich als 25 j hriger immer noch 15 j hrige spielen sollte
7012928 ich bin kein gro artiger regisseur ich bin ein guter regisseur
7012929 insbesondere das ard olympiaradio war f r sportfans ein echtes schmuckst ck hier kamen die schnelligkeit und die authentizit t des radios besonders gut zum tragen
7012930 not only did it do well on the air it did phenomenally well in the international and dvd market
7012931 a disproportionately larger amount of money from foreign and dvd money
7012932 i think it is the holy grail for us in which we get high quality programming for a lower license fee
7012933 i was impressed with how high they were able to make it
7012934 what you dont want to do is do them in some half assed way where theyre not as good as they needed to be
7012935 what was more of a burden to ron in this particular case was the availability of whos out there
7012936 thats not to say were not getting phone calls from their agents saying theyre huge now and were respectful of that were not expecting anyone to do it because they owe us there are actors that have come to some prominence theyre helping us out because they want to do it
7012937 the longer answer is all of our fans are kind of rowdy and invested
7012938 theres no question that theres an appetite for wanting more by the way which started with us
7012939 i promise you that not having shot a frame of footage it will blow you away
7012940 im a big fan of edward james olmos as a director
7012941 all his episodes have been highly unique and really wild especially that one from season 3 taking a break from all your worries that was wild
7012942 ik startte al slecht na twee ronden heb ik even gedacht ik stap eruit maar dat wilde ik toch niet het is een raar gevoel als je uit de wedstrijd wordt genomen

7012945 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7012946 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7012947 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7012948 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7012949 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7012950 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now

7012960 i feel that maybe any feelings you have for me have toned down and i have realized that its my fault and i want to apologise because i know its my fault that ive nearly lost you
7012961 nothing nothing susi i just realize my mistakes now thats all
7012962 no player will be kept here against their will this does not mean that madrid will not defend the interests of the club
7012963 im sure that robinho has already weighed up the consequences of his decision and im sure that in the next few days he will give a letter to the club to announce that he wants to go if he does not want to be here he should leave as soon as possible
7012964 i can tell you that madrid are not going to transfer robinho we are not going to sell him if he wants to go then he should go now telling the press about it is not the right way to do things
7012965 its not necessarily that he will have to pay the 150 million euros he would end his contract but the courts will decide what he has to pay
7012966 nobody is obliged to stay here but we will defend our interests
7012967 this is what we announced publicly on our webpage he should leave as soon as possible but he must accept the consequences of rescinding his contract when it has two years remaining
7012968 i hear that we wants to go well he will have to give notice in writing
7012969 no because the transfers need to be done at the end of the competition not five days before the start of the season its a lack of respect to the club its history and to the fans we want robinho to stay in madrid
7012970 right now with this situation we cannot do anything to take a decision like that in life you have to abide by the consequences
7012971 its not the moment to say that he wants to leave this is in may but he will have weighed up the consequences
7012972 if he doesnt want to play he wont play but this is his problem im going to defend our interests
7012973 if he says tomorrow that no he doesnt want to go that he was only raising the idea then we can talk madrid respect his decision and nobody can work where they dont want to
7012974 we are not thinking about this possibility at the moment but we are going to weigh it up
7012975 if robinho confirms that we will not continue we will contemplate this possibility but i am not the one who decides that up until now the team have done very well and the work of mijatovic and schuster has been very good
7012976 i am unable to appreciate how a breach of time frame being fixed in nature can have equivalent compliance
7012977 the failure to comply with the provisions of section 169 on the time frame for service was fatal to the petition the petitioner is non suited
7012978 the leader of all men engaged in the exegesis of the quran he amassed and categorized all the knowledge he heard people marveled at his fatwas and benefited from his teachings his fatwas grew widely popular all across the country he was renowned for his precision and was proclaimed as the beacon of history hadith and exegesis of the quran
7012979 of all our contemporaries he ibn katheer was the best at memorizing authentic hadiths and the most knowledgeable as to assessing the degree of reliability and honesty of hadithnarrators as well as authentic and non authentic hadiths his comrades and mentors acknowledge every word of the above i would frequently visit him and every time i was in his company i benefited from him
7012980 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7012981 its going to be very difficult to dislodge china the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7012982 it was just an amazing experience that you just dont get every day
7012983 now im in the finals again its been a good month for me
7012984 she was just ready to fight on every point and i started to feel a little bit tired
7012985 after it was worse and worse and finally at the end of the match the two last games i was out of the match
7012986 i would love to become no 1 in the world and win grand slams
7012987 i think everyone practicing this hard you know putting such an effort in it wants to become no 1 in the world but theres only one no 1 so you know you need to put some hard work in it you know i still have 21 spots to go and hopefully after this tournament i have a little bit less
7012988 i just lost the ball in the sky i dont know how it happened
7012989 i should serve better tomorrow definitely because i think wozniacki plays more aggressive than amelie does
7012990 thats also what i was missing i was not able to find these for the last month or so and it was pretty frustrating also to be on the court and a little bit like not really finding joy and happiness and motivation
7012991 at the beginning of the year my secret goal was to reach my first atp final and im really glad that i did it
7012992 i feel like with my serve and my serve game if i can get two breaks in a set ill feel pretty comfortable
7012993 dia memang bagian dari rencana rencana saya tapi anda harus mengerti saat dia bermain di milan dia adalah pemain dengan karakter yang sangat berbeda
7012994 kejuaraan di sana berbeda dengan di inggris kami harus memikirkan keseimbangan ini
7012995 mungkin dia perlu lebih percaya diri lebih percaya diri bersama kami di sini munkin juga dia perlu latihan lebih dari yang dilakukannya sekarang dia mungkin juga perlu waktu
7012996 saya punya anelka sekarang kondisinya bagus sheva dan saya sama sama perlu waktu
7012997 saya tidak akan berkomentar tentang isu itu yang saya tahu kami sedang berupaya meningkatkan performa skuad
7012998 awal musim kami memang mencari cara untuk meningkatkan dana klub tapi sekarang kami senang dengan adanya xabi alonso dia pemain hebat
7012999 penawaran kami ajukan tidak mendapat tanggapan bagus jadi kenapa kami harus menjualnya
7013000 kami membicarakan pemain yang kami miliki bagaimana meningkatkan performa klub kami berdua tahu kerja sama kami sangat penting bagi klub
7013001 kami selalu bekerja keras kami sedang berjalan ke arah yang benar dan berharap bisa melakukan hal yang positif beberapa hari ke depan
7013002 kami tidak membicarakan nama tapi kami mencoba berusaha memperbaiki skuad terlebih dulu
7013003 before you bella my life was like a moonless night
7013004 i am now the happiest person on the land proggy akandirova iye akazorohwavo nelaw so i think its a fair deal after all
7013005 while progress was sent to jail he has also crippled me because i am taking a lot of tablets by the way i have also sustained loose teeth
7013006 but overall i think justice was done because progress was a problem
7013007 padare is greatly disturbed by the act of violence perpetrated by progress on regedzai matongo and the outcome of the court could have been avoided if the physical assault had not been done
7013008 the work we do with men is centred around redefining our understanding and notion of manhood wherein masculinity or maleness is associated with physical aggression dominance over women and girls sexual prowess multiple sex partners and a readiness to engage in high risk behaviour
7013009 this belief and practice has not helped men it has also not helped progress as well
7013010 this judgement is a call for men to make an introspection into their beliefs do they think their wives and ex girl friends should be battered
7013011 do they think the best way to solve conflicts is through physical aggression men should adopt and embrace values of tolerance which in fact will make them stronger as fathers as husbands as uncles and as grandfathers
7013012 women should know that its never their fault to be battered but instead a clear demonstration of the inequalities between men and women hence courts are there to ensure that justice is served
7013013 ultimately men and women relate to one another in a dignified manner that ensures zero tolerance to violence
7013014 padare will continue to engage men to challenge patriarchal notions of manhood in ourselves and in society
7013015 i feel justice was done but to some extent i also feel that the magistrate was a little bit lenient on progress by giving him only five months when he committed such a serious offence
7013016 the problem with other women is that they dont report such cases due to ignorance and fear of the unknown
7013017 cases of domestic violence are on the increase but their perpetrators are rarely brought to book which should become a thing of the past
7013018 employment of medical transcriptionists is projected to grow 14 percent from 2006 to 2016 faster than the average for all occupations
7013019 we have to see what kind of amendments come then only we can decide but we cannot accept prescriptive conditionalities
7013020 there may be changes in the text but we will not allow any changes that will impede the process or block cooperation
7013021 adams one of those really really tough guys you give him an inch and he is all over you
7013022 between 30 and 35 miscreants were killed and several more were injured when our forces launched offensives in kabal and kanjo sub districts
7013023 the explosion was so huge that it partially damaged around 40 nearby houses and shops
7013024 until the government fully implements the agreement it has signed with us we will continue carrying out attacks
7013025 nato is enhancing its military presence on the black sea under the pretext of providing humanitarian aid
7013026 twelve militants a colonel and two soldiers of the indian army were killed in the gunbattle which went on for more than 36 hours
7013027 i said before i left that ireland would not be involved in a doping scandal of any nature
7013028 and unfortunately this has now become a huge embarrassment for the country
7013029 i think it is more serious for the equestrian sport and also for the horse industry in ireland because there is a vote next year on which sports will remain in the olympic programme and which will go out
7013030 so i think from what i hear from colleagues that this sport could be in serious difficulties for next years vote whether they remain in the programme or not
7013031 sabia que tinha a chance de fazer algo que nunca ningu m tinha conseguido na argentina e um orgulho saber que fiz para um pa s que ama o futebol e que conseguiu em duas olimp adas seguidas ganhar a medalha de ouro
7013032 um dia hist rico para mim que ficar para sempre na mem ria aconte a o que acontecer na minha carreira daqui para fente fiz um esfor o grande para estar aqui e agora quero aproveitar
7013033 pessoalmente acho que ningu m vai me tirar essa alegria n o pouca coisa
7013034 yeah from my perspective it was a pretty good ballgame for five innings
7013035 you cant walk three people there in the sixth inning with leads
7013036 were playing so good who really cares about your stats
7013037 sabia antes de vir aqui que valeria a pena saiu tudo redondo depois de tudo o que se falou o que se disse este grupo merecia e n s conseguimos o que quer amos
7013038 nunca duvidei que fosse jogar disseram muitas coisas muitas eram mentiras quero agradecer a meu clube para forma que me tratou
7013039 nada paga a alegria que demos ao nosso pa s
7013040 o futebol da argentina conquistou a medalha de ouro merecida
7013041 a incerteza e o cansa o est o fazendo um estrago

7013047 even if i am a minority of one truth is still the truth
7013048 the smallest minority on earth is the individual those who deny individual rights cannot claim to be defenders of minorities
7013049 there are four characteristics which brand a country unmistakably as a dictatorship one party rule executions without trial or with a mock trial for political offenses the nationalization or expropriation of private property and censorship a country guilty of these outrages forfeits any moral prerogatives any claim to national rights or sovereignty and becomes an outlaw
7013050 i will take a decision after talking to ministers who won the elections as independent in ranchi
7013051 i will announce my decision anyhow today either in the evening or at night
7013052 it is not a personal issue that i alone can make a decision all the independents will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision
7013053 when the upa government was formed earlier in jharkhand independents were first taken into confidence this time it was just opposite
7013054 no proposal for a better leadership was put before us or there were no convincing arguments given here as to why a change of leadership in required in jharkhand at all
7013055 i did sometimes i feel like going sky diving and just not pulling the cord
7013056 shit maybe i should actually do something that matters before i die
7013057 will you just leave me alone when i think of you my head fills with fear even though i may look happy now all my smiles are cut ear to ear
7013058 fuck you asshole you have a big dick and you get paid to get laid
7013059 a minister of a ugandan mega church and known internationally as a poverty relief advocate
7013060 first of all ssenyonga is not under the organization i lead but i know him as a person who married a young woman when he was a young man and they are happily married
7013061 its not surprising because we have gays rapists conmen and extortionists who are masquerading as pastors in uganda
7013062 aber warum sind wir jetzt dabei die tiere zu zerst ren auf deren r cken wir das land erobert haben

7013073 throughout history the best pictures have always come in a yellow box
7013074 since you are in bangalore have you any idea why there were violent riots there when saddam hussain was executed
7013075 i dont think i mean as much to you as you do to me
7013076 please tell me why you dont think you mean as much to me as i do to you
7013077 it isnt that simple i have tried to explain i tried before it was too late and several times after i am just trying to think of a way to express myself in terms common to both of us
7013078 one dollar thats all our relationship was worth to you
7013079 not so fast this is a special account and a special dollar
7013080 my pereption of my value is the whole dollar if all you are will to give is 99 cents the deal is broken
7013081 absplutely wouldnt have it any other way you can never have too many friends unless of course you win the lottery he was more than a friend he was a lover
7013082 i want in love with him and i didnt have sex with him
7013083 i know i ded i told you before you went to meet him that i wouldnt tolerate it you knew where i stood and by going to meet him you told me where you stood
7013084 i know you didnt but you gambled everthing on it we both lost
7013085 i wasnt invited or things might have turned out differently i might have percieved my value to you to still be the whole dollar since i wont settle for less than the whole dollar because that wouldnt be fair to either of us i did what i had to do
7013086 you deserve someone you can give the whole dollar to also

7013128 it was hell both of us thought at one point that we would never be able to resolve it i was a prisoner of my imagination my paranoid fantasies where i would imagine jacques with other women i couldnt stop myself even though i knew i was doing myself harm
7013129 it took jacques to put this argument in front of me for me to suddenly realise what i had been doing
7013130 people have criticised the sexual life of catherine m for being devoid of feeling
7013131 but that was deliberate action on my part i wanted to show pleasure could be independent of feeling
7013132 is a response to all those readers who had thought despite the neutral tone of the book that my life was just a perpetual and pleasurable debauchery that i was making a case for hedonism and even for conversion
7013133 to all these people i would say that having and living a free sexuality does not prevent you from falling into the awful trap of jealousy and nor does it immunise you against the pain which accompanies it

7013150 they could quite easily have died if we hadnt got to them in time
7013151 my feeling is that they will have to be raised because inflation is going to be a problem the bank cannot do anything about oil prices and it cannot do anything about global food prices

7013156 britain is today experiencing the longest period of sustained economic growth since records began in the year 1701
7013157 i can report that after 10 years of sustained growth britains growth will continue into its 59th quarter the forecast end of the cycle and beyond
7013158 while other countries have suffered recessions the british economy has now been growing continuously for over a decade the longest period of sustained growth in our history

7013170 el elevator pitch ideal para tentar a un inversor angel
7013171 el club trabaja de una manera sumamente colaborativa los inversores son voluntarios en todo el proceso luego de un primer screening invitamos a los emprendedores a reuniones en las que deben presentar el proyecto en 20 minutos ante un comit de preselecci n integrado por los mismos inversores luego de estas reuniones y de alg n otro pedido anterior de informaci n se seleccionan dos emprendedores para que muestren su proyecto en nuestros foros mensuales donde est n invitados todos nuestros inversores
7013172 la idea era crear una nueva generaci n de emprendimientos que nazcan y se desempe en de la mejor manera
7013173 mi experiencia fue muy buena el trato con los emprendedores pide una posici n firme pero muy respetuosa de sus ideas de sus sue os y de su curva de aprendizaje cuando tenemos algo realmente positivo para aportar los emprendedores saben detectarlo y lo toman
7013174 en las empresas que decid invertir el denominador com n fue que eran proyectos innovadores que ofrec an oportunidades nicas y donde hab a mucho esp ritu emprendedor y buena qu mica entre las partes
7013175 uno de los requisitos es que compartan nuestra filosof a y que se tenga en claro que se trata de una inversi n de capital de riesgo y por este motivo no es segura despu s hay que estar dispuesto a dedicarle algo de tiempo porque no somos un fondo de inversi n en donde la administraci n se delega a una empresa
7013176 desde el punto de vista del inversor somos muy cautelosos en el momento del ingreso de un nuevo miembro porque hay temas muy delicados como la confidencialidad de los proyectos que recibimos y el respeto de determinados valores ticos el club est abierto a los antiguos alumnos del iae colaboradores y personas referidas de la competencia naves
7013177 entendemos esta industria de manera que haya m ltiples clubes como el nuestro con cierta homogeneidad y confianza entre sus integrantes y no un solo superclub con miles de miembros que no se conozcan entre s estamos totalmente abiertos a co invertir con otros grupos de inversores o inversores individuales
7013178 como requisito pedimos que como m nimo se haga una inversi n de u s 20 000 en alg n proyecto a lo largo del primer a o luego de ese per odo es libre
7013179 el ingreso no tiene costo porque no cobramos ni a los emprendedores ni a los inversores es una asociaci n y unimos fuerza para hacer algo es muy dif cil de lograr en forma individual por el tiempo que demanda
7013180 la sensaci n al salir es que nos hab a ido p simo y que no bamos a tener ning n inversor me hicieron pocas preguntas y sent que hab a poco inter s me imagino que as se debe sentir cualquiera
7013181 de los cinco quedaron tres con los que cerramos el deal ajustando el precio y la participaci n
7013182 est bamos definiendo nuestro plan de negocios y hab amos iniciado la preparaci n de material en septiembre del 2005 para buscar inversores de tipo seed capital o friends and families
7013183 en estas primeras etapas el componente humano y la confianza son claves porque la posibilidad de desviarse del plan de negocios es muy alta ya que est todo el camino por recorrer y m s en un compa a con seis meses de vida
7013184 en definitiva muy bien para una empresa que reci n empresa y que no desea hipotecar un futuro incierto

7013193 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7013194 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience
7013195 but 20 years of experience that has not been very solid in terms of projecting what was going to happen just doesnt make you a better commander in chief
7013196 we dont need as a commander in chief a war hero johns a war hero we need someone with some wisdom
7013197 les environnements sont v ritablement immenses tr s riches et d taill s et surtout tr s cr dibles on a vraiment le sentiment de se promener en pleine savane le feeling des armes est plut t bon en revanche elles ont tendance senrayer trop souvent tel point quil tait difficile de vider un chargeur sans avoir secouer son flingue dans tous les sens en revanche il est presque impossible de tuer quelquun sans passer en vis e ironsight les ennemis ne se mettent pas couvert ils se jettent b tement au sol alors que personne na encore commenc tirer ils saccroupissent en plein milieu du chemin alors quon les tient en joue avec une mitrailleuse fixe ils se barrent en courant et sarr tent tous les trois m tres en nous tournant le dos alors quon les poursuit avec une machette si le jeu sort en l tat les combats ne pr senteront v ritablement aucun int r t

7013259 perhaps real world climate sensitivity is very much below the ipccs estimates perhaps therefore there is no climate crisis at all the correct policy approach to a non problem is to have the courage to do nothing
7013260 i was impressed by an hour long academic lecture which criticized claims about global warming and explained the implications of the physics of radiative transfer for climate change
7013261 to me the value of this paper lies in its dispassionate but ruthlessly clear exposition or rather expos of the ipccs method of evaluating climate sensitivity the detailed arguments in this paper and indeed in a large number of other scientific papers point up extensive errors including numerous projection errors of climate models as well as misleading statements by the ipcc consequently there are no rational grounds for believing either the ipcc or any other claims of dangerous anthropogenic global warming
7013262 was 0 3 f cooler than the 1901 2000 average
7013263 its not ice melt but rather wind circulation that drives ocean currents northward from the tropics climate models until now have not properly accounted for the winds effects on ocean circulation so researchers have compensated by over emphasizing the role of man made warming on polar ice melt

7013297 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7013298 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7013299 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7013300 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7013301 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7013302 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7013303 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7013304 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7013305 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7013306 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7013307 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7013308 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7013309 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7013310 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7013311 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7013312 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7013313 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7013314 this is about shifting the power back to the people
7013315 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7013316 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7013317 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7013318 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7013319 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7013320 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7013321 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7013322 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7013323 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7013324 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7013325 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
7013326 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7013327 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
7013328 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7013329 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7013330 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7013331 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7013332 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7013333 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7013334 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7013335 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7013336 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7013337 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7013338 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7013339 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7013340 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7013341 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7013342 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7013343 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7013344 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7013345 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7013346 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7013347 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7013348 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7013349 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7013350 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7013351 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7013352 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7013353 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7013354 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7013355 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7013356 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7013357 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7013358 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7013359 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7013360 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7013361 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7013362 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7013363 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7013364 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7013365 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7013366 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7013367 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7013368 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7013369 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7013370 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7013371 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7013372 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7013373 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7013374 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7013375 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7013376 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7013377 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7013378 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7013379 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7013380 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7013381 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7013382 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7013383 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7013384 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7013385 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7013386 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7013387 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7013388 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7013389 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7013390 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7013391 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7013392 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7013393 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7013394 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7013395 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7013396 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7013397 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7013398 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7013399 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7013400 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7013401 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
7013402 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
7013403 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
7013404 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
7013405 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
7013406 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
7013407 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7013408 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7013409 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7013410 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7013411 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7013412 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7013413 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7013414 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7013415 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7013416 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7013417 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7013418 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7013419 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7013420 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7013421 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7013422 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7013423 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7013424 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7013425 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7013426 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7013427 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7013428 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7013429 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7013430 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7013431 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7013432 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7013433 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7013434 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7013435 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7013436 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7013437 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7013438 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7013439 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7013440 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7013441 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7013442 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7013443 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7013444 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7013445 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7013446 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7013447 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7013448 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7013449 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7013450 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7013451 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7013452 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7013453 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7013454 the terrorists can win and quite often do and its global anarchy it sums up the randomness of geo politics pretty well
7013455 could be used to conceal someones identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act
7013456 its absurd a beard can conceal someones identity are the police going to start banning beards
7013457 je tiens me remercier car cest quand m me moi le cerveau de
7013458 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7013459 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president

7013466 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
7013467 on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
7013468 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education

7013477 data yang dilansir pada awal 2008 itu menunjukkan masih banyak pekerjaan rumah yang harus dihadapi oleh bangsa indonesia selain itu data itu juga menunjukkan bahwa menempuh pendidikan di pt hanya menjadi salah satu jalur yang dilalui untuk menempuh tantangan di arena hidup yang sesungguhnya cepat atau tidaknya lulusan pt bekerja bergantung kepada kreativitas dan keinovatifan dalam menggali potensi yang dimiliki

7013479 salah satu bahan pangan yang diimpor dari luar negeri yaitu gandum impor bahan untuk pembuatan roti itu berasal dari beberapa negara di benua amerika dan eropa sedikitnya 4 5 juta ton gandum setiap tahun didatangkan ke indonesia

7013500 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7013501 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

7013504 we are with those hapless farmers whose land had been taken forcibly to set up tatas nano car project
7013505 for example we will accelerate the removal and treatment of heavily polluting vehicles and step up construction site dust reduction
7013506 project builders in beijing must increase their input in environment protection
7013507 although the olympic games will end soon the environmental challenges we face are by no means over
7013508 if they cant resolve the pollution problems they should stop or limit their production
7013509 in the past couple of years we have helped over 1 000 people of this area to get jobs in various industries and about 120 youths have also been provided employment in foreign countries
7013510 we demanded that rahul issue directions for timely payments to the sugarcane farmers
7013511 the relief material is reaching only the well to do families while the poor are being neglected rahul gandhi instructed the dm to remove the anomalies and assure effective flood relief work
7013512 im confident that we can protect children here and that is my top priority the protection of children not of offenders
7013513 it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival here
7013514 there has been no opportunity to put forward why he was innocent of those crimes for which he was convicted in vietnam
7013515 he did not commit the offences for which he was convicted in vietnam
7013516 it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his defence forward ultimately he wants that to be tested if he can before the courts of this country

7013518 using proteopedia anyone can easily create descriptions of biomacromolecules linked to their 3d structure
7013519 we are presenting proteopedia to the scientific community to judge its usefulness and merit and we truly hope that it will offer an effective and appealing way to convey the link between 3d structure and function
7013520 the work started on naval academy 21 years ago it was proceeding at a slow pace recently the central government has allotted rs 221 crore rs 2 21 billion for the academy to quickly complete the project
7013521 the problem with kerala is that all the projects here end up in controversies the issue of development should remain above politics
7013522 at present uighurs do not feel secure anywhere in china including east turkestan as they are seen as political suspects by the prc chinese authorities
7013523 i am extremely concerned that the chinese government will launch a
7013524 such a move will further destabilise the region and is not in the best interest of china i urge restraint on the part of the chinese government to not use the recent incidents in east turkestan to persecute uighurs
7013525 i also urge the international community to speak out on behalf of uyghurs and to prevent imminent and systematic human rights abuses against a peaceful people
7013526 this is the same 3d capture technology used in hollywood blockbusters
7013527 the little ones kept on pulling them off with their trunks
7013528 we do no want to force them back to the communities they had left during the xenophobic attacks
7013529 we have a responsibility to provide housing water and sanitation to everyone this also applies to the foreign nationals
7013530 we are aware that people in ramaphosa informal settlement do not want foreigners but we have to meet with them and understand their reasons for refusing
7013531 it s gonna be an awesome party with more than 7 things i like
7013532 it s gonna be totally awesome i hope it s a great time
7013533 he is pleased to be back in this country because for the first time he can appear before a court of justice
7013534 he tells me that his trial in vietnam a country which has been condemned by virtually every organisation concerned with justice and human rights was a charade was a travesty of justice
7013535 mr gadd has demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
7013536 that was an opportunity that i sought to take on his behalf but the court decided it did not want to hear
7013537 therefore this morning there has been no opportunity before an impartial tribunal to put forward why it was he was innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted in vietnam there may be another opportunity in the future it s too early to tell
7013538 mr gadd wants me to say to you that he did not commit the offences for which he was convicted it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his defence forward
7013539 ultimately he wants that to be tested if he can before the courts of this country
7013540 mr gadd now has three days to work with the police it s a completely harmonious relationship between him and the police
7013541 mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety
7013542 using proteopedia anyone can easily create descriptions of biomacromolecules linked to their 3d structure
7013543 we are presenting proteopedia to the scientific community to judge its usefulness and merit and we truly hope that it will offer an effective and appealing way to convey the link between 3d structure and function

7013557 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
7013558 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells

7013608 the aim of the concert was to create an image and spread message about the aids awareness among the youth and socially conscious people
7013609 when we organize such music shows we get a lot of response and a lot of people come through the medium of music we can spread the message of aids awareness

7013613 i first got the idea to do the film when i visited the plain of jars in laos in 2002
7013614 you could still see the craters from the air bombing and unexploded ordnance was everywhere
7013615 then i heard about long chen and the fact that no one had got there since the war and i thought how do i visit and how do i make a film about it
7013616 i found it bizarre that at one time this was the second biggest city in laos and it was completely secret
7013617 laos was the progenitor of the way america fights wars in the 21st century
7013618 outsourcing the war to private companies gathering public support by falsifying intelligence and documents embedded journalism and automated warfare including the use of so called smart weapons all these methods were first tested in laos
7013619 the cia had just declassified a whole lot of material so that helped as well
7013620 the most important source was the guys who were over there filming with their little super 8 cameras often illegally
7013621 we destroyed a whole civilisation we wiped it off the map we incinerated atomised human remains in this air war and what happened in the end we lost
7013622 after we went another uk crew tried to get there but they were caught and deported
7013623 there are some places in the world that have a different energy and long chen is one of these you look down the runway and think this is the place were it all happened the planes took off from here and bombed all those people
7013624 its just an army outpost now a small village a couple of hundred people soldiers and their families
7013625 the golden age of long chen is over it used to be the high tech oasis for spooks in laos there were allegedly more antennas there than trees now they do not even have power
7013626 there are still some groups but they are not organised they are certainly not politically or militarily organised they are remnants the children and grandchildren of those involved in the war who are scared to come out of the jungle because they have never known anything else
7013627 whether vang pao is guilty or not of the charges he is facing one thing that is true is that he and other expatriate hmong have used these people as pawns
7013628 i do not see that happening in the next few years it is still far too sensitive on the part of the lao government
7013629 they are also keen not to risk unsettling relations with the americans by opening it up
7013630 it is the last chapter of the vietnam war and both governments have an interest in making sure it is forgotten
7013631 brain drain is another consequence of labor shortages because of high tax rates that hinder productivity growth and human capital utilization in the real sector

7013636 we were a bit battered after the parramatta game but were professional football players and its no excuse i dont think our preparation was on cue today
7013637 i think we just need to build a little momentum coming into the semi finals
7013638 democratic house speaker nancy pelosi and her liberal allies will stop at nothing to get don young through the primary so they can win in november with ethan berkowitz
7013639 they want don young and they cant have him because alaskans are going to stand up and elect me for congress
7013640 ill bet you any money you want to bet that i can win the primary and i can beat ethan berkowitz
7013641 i see that our friend don young is here im a little bit surprised i guess he came here to concede the election
7013642 im more physically capable than most people in this room i challenge anybody in this room if they want to go three rounds with me down at sullivan arena
7013643 i think we need a new direction a new voice part of that is because of the diminished effectiveness
7013644 i think you guys are all going to be surprised because i think at the end of the day this election will be an absolute horse race
7013645 it appears as though in this highly unusual and disappointing move that national party democrats feel they can influence the minds and hearts of republicans by spending a little money
7013646 we have no preference as to the republican nominee and are prepared for a vigorous debate with whoever emerges from the republican primary
7013647 ive got the experience to be effective in washington d c ive got the proven track record for what i stood up for in juneau and ive been talking about the issue thats most on the minds of alaskans
7013648 i want to be the person who goes to washington d c spreads that word i have the ability to do that i have the will to do it
7013649 i think we have too many career politicians serving in congress and that hasnt benefited the people
7013650 i say lets set the boundaries in campaigns that way youve got a precedent before you even go into office youre not bought
7013651 all people have to do is look at my record im a guy who stood up to corporate influence time and again when i was in the state legislature
7013652 should have some regrets about helping to elect republican frank murkowski
7013653 i did talk to a high powered lobbyist who had done a poll for whoever his client was and the only thing he was willing to tell me is it was extremely close
7013654 i am very strong on civil liberties and veterans with a passion that nobody else has
7013655 alle activiteiten van de russische vredestroepen zijn gebaseerd op de zes principes die door de russische en franse presidenten zijn ondertekend
7013656 er bestaan geen rechtse of linkse themas wel goede of slechte oplossingen
7013657 na 450 dagen hebben we gewoon helemaal geen bestuur en we hebben ook helemaal geen grote staatshervorming voor de verkiezingen was er nog een window of opportunity om arbeidsmarktbeleid te regionaliseren of de financieringswet te herzien maar door de non methode van leterme en het d dain van de n va en de waalse partijen tegenover elkaar kan er nu niets meer
7013658 socialisten die regeren moeten diepgaande hervormingen mogelijk maken ik zie geen enkele aanwijzing bij de huidige meerderheid dat ze dat wil
7013659 gelukkig hebben we nog administraties die min of meer hun werk doen
7013660 i thought it was gonna be a free hat or a free meal or something
7013661 it was my second fish and when it was coming up i was kind of laughing because its not real big
7013662 then we thought maybe someone else had hooked it because it had a golden hook in it
7013663 we thumped it in the head to make sure it didnt jump out of the fish box
7013664 ive told this story so many times and every time i have to walk around and shake it off
7013665 right now im pacing around on my deck i am angry thinking about that little fish
7013666 we heard a 2 000 one got caught but the person had no ticket so he threw it back which was great
7013667 we had one 1 000 one caught and paid for
7013668 every senator and their spouse should detail every nickel of their income
7013669 too numerous to mention as i have frequently used candidacy as a platform to expose corruption
7013670 if im elected to u s senate i will do what i have always done i will bring light and ethics to government
7013671 its more about tearing down people than what alaskans are interested in alaska families are interested in and thats laying out what youre going to do to make a difference
7013672 i think the last time i was here i suggested that this was going to happen and a lot of people were quite skeptical
7013673 that kind of raised his credibility somewhat but it hasnt raised it to the point where he can kind of credibly run for national office theres a big gap there
7013674 weve had no energy plan in congress for 40 years and the crisis we face today is because of that
7013675 at the end of the day its who you surround yourself with what kind of team you have and do you understand how to give directions

7013678 the fact is ray continues to throw this mud on as an issue to get name id on the campaign that hes facing between now and aug 26

7013685 we need a strong constitution that protects us from our government firstly there should be a limit to the amount of tax they can take from us all forms of tax such as income gst and petrol tax etc this will limit their budget and prevent them from wasting our money on hair brained schemes specifically aimed to keep people voting for them secondly they should be bound to protect law abiding citizens from enemy attack from criminals and from predicted disasters thirdly they should be bound to look after our well being providing access to a minimum of essential health services and a limited and defined emergency welfare package lastly they should be responsible for ensuring the education of the population to a defined and acceptable level for all such as secondary school qualification all these should be limited by the constitution and amended as and when needed only by binding referenda the courts of law should be the final arbitrator of whether or not the government are achieving the defined standards or abusing the constitution these courts should be separately elected by the people or consist of the people juries and real human rights not the un clap trap should also be guaranteed it is time for the people to control those who represent us rather than have those who win the poll thinking this gives then the right to dictate to us to think for us and to control us

7013688 i knew he was a good catcher but hes a great receiver
7013689 hes really good he blocks the ball better than i thought he did what he brings behind the plate a wealth of knowledge against the hitters is great ive enjoyed throwing to him i think weve gelled pretty quickly
7013690 the first day there was a little bit of uncertainty early because i wasnt sure how hitters react to him you use those first three of four innings to get a bit of a read today there was much more rhythm
7013691 lazarus has done a fantastic job as brand guardian of ogilvy driving the company to fully embrace integrated marketing under 360 degree brand stewardship she has also taken ogilvy from a strong position both geographically and functionally to a superb position shell be an extremely difficult act to follow and we are delighted she will continue to focus as chairman of the ogilvy group on developing ogilvys client relationships

7013697 oh what is there to say about telegraph except that you have to go there at least once in your life its that memorable
7013698 information anxiety causes people to put off decisions so they have more time to think time drags out as they try to process information it takes so long for them to find understand and prioritize their options that business processes slow to a crawl by the time anyone takes action situations have turned into crises and stress levels are high the worst possible environment for good decision making
7013699 a visual explanation clears away this fog of confusion by depicting complex information visually in order to make it more clear concise and concrete this allows people to quickly grasp key issues and make faster better decisions
7013700 a picture can connect to the strategic with the tactical in a way that no other communication possibly can it can clearly articulates who does what with whom and when and that is surely worth at least a thousand words
7013701 it is as if sportsmen and women have a higher base level of sexual energy but why can it be that one of the underlying drivers of sporting greatness is also the very thing that produces an overactive sex drive

7013752 all they would do is come in and maybe look in one or two rooms and thats it
7013753 they have to have some place to stay and we are trying to police it as much as possible

7013811 it was a dark and stormy night the rain fell in torrents except at occasional intervals when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets for it is in london that our scene lies rattling along the housetops and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness

7013835 my personal experience is that people around here are very conservative with water especially when they have to pay for it
7013836 the ones that do id assume would be the older wells under 50 feet deep that depend on runoff
7013837 with that being said id still encourage people not to waste water
7013838 i dont know if they were ever that excessive but the perception is there
7013839 we dont want this to be just one event rather a series of events that come together
7013840 we know that oak ridge is much more than just the last 10 years but this year gives us a reason to celebrate
7013841 its always been about people and what makes oak ridge special and not just the incorporation
7013842 the town council took the unusual step of requesting a meeting between staff developer and residents of the neighborhood to attempt to negotiate a settlement of the case
7013843 it doesnt really matter who gets in the new president is in for a very hard time it doesnt take too many more hundreds of billions in bailouts to be more than the taxpayers can handle
7013844 private industry is where the innovations need to come from
7013845 obama is a great talker but can he lead congress into the right moves to salvage the economy
7013846 no matter who wins the november election the economy will not improve overnight
7013847 we must find a way for the national government as well as state and local government to cut out the wasteful spending bring jobs back to america and find alternative energy sources
7013848 i do not like the war stance of mccain but have economic issues with more government programs and other democrat obama economics
7013849 more government in our lives and erode freedoms plus we know what happens to programs run by the government
7013850 it appears that the past eight years have resulted in one of the worst economies in decades the highest deficit severely damaged international reputation and the lowest support for womens rights since the 1970s
7013851 a positive but short lived effect on our countrys economy
7013852 i have been a grocery shopper for 50 years and i am dismayed at how much prices are rising
7013853 something must be done and soon and i am not sure a new president is the answer i keep listening to mccain and obamas plans to help our economy but wonder just how much they can do
7013854 with such a positive response we decided to make our garden art available to the public
7013855 we are investigating whether he is operating a business out of a residential property a location not zoned for commercial retail sales
7013856 what it comes down to in this particular case is is it artwork or commercial sales if he wants them to be art as weve currently classified them they cannot be offered for sale
7013857 if we get the answers from them aqua well work with them 100 percent if not well look for other channels
7013858 we prefer to present this special facility to the public when there is some grass and landscaping and when it better resembles a park
7013859 once student enrollment settles often this is not until a week or two into the school year i will examine our needs as a total school facility and make decisions regarding how the mobile units can best accommodate these needs
7013860 the meeting was an effort to get feedback from neighbors
7013861 it was an effort to get input on our plan in a collaborative manner
7013862 it is important that we try to address the concerns of our neighbors the community and the town of summerfield the meeting on the 31st was the first step in that process
7013863 just how many grocery stores do we need in this area anyway
7013864 we already have a walgreens going up 100 yards from a cvs with a food lion behind it i thought this was summerfield not wendover avenue
7013865 if it were flat i would be much less concerned but that septic field slopes downward and could seep into the water systems it just doesnt stand to reason that that would work
7013866 the developer said they did a traffic study and this development wouldnt impact traffic by more than about two seconds
7013867 we are clearly taking those comments seriously thats really the stage were in now with the planning process
7013868 i understand peoples concerns about the negatives and redundancies associated with the proposed harris teeter in summerfield
7013869 summerfield was incorporated to provide protection from annexation by the city of greensboro and incursion of high density development
7013870 why in the world would we want this mess in summerfield
7013871 remember that the citizens of summerfield have the right under north carolina general statute 160 a 385 and 386 to file a protest petition to the summerfield city council
7013872 here we go again a group of big money investors trying to make summerfield more than just a nice place to raise a family
7013873 i think this development is a wonderful opportunity for the town
7013874 commercial development should include the highest density high impact uses at the major node intersections while lower density low impact uses should be located at the minor nodes and town core areas
7013875 due to its physical constraints it is unlikely that study areas would support large scale industrial or retail development
7013876 please be advised that this property is in fact not located at an intersection
7013877 hmm good ideas summerfield will just keep being known as a bedroom community and we all can benefit from those higher gas prices on those commute times to work in greensboro and we all know what a high water mark food lion is

7013881 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7013882 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7013883 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7013884 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7013885 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7013886 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7013887 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

7013892 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7013893 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7013894 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7013895 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade

7013901 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
7013902 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

7014042 zodra de gebruiker een artikel over voetbal deelt gaat het de eerste keer naar beide vrienden maar de volgende keer wanneer de ene vriend heeft aangegeven niet ge nteresseerd te zijn in voetbal alleen nog maar naar n van de twee vrienden
7014043 het idee hierachter is dat je vroeger maar die zenders had waar je de dag later gewoon met je vrienden over kon praten met internet heb je tegenwoordig een overvloed aan informatie vrienden zijn vaak wel ge nteresseerd in dezelfde dingen dus dat moet je kunnen delen met elkaar
7014044 zodra je iets in een browser vindt moet je vaak meerdere handelingen verrichten voor je het door kan mailen
7014045 google meet op het aantal links en op hoeveel mensen daarop klikken dat is een grote groep met je vrienden zoek je misschien alleen naar je plaatselijke voetbalclub je kan dus specifiekere resultaten tonen vrienden zoeken vaak naar wat jij ook interessant vindt je hebt toch overlappende interesses met de een deel je je interesse in sport met de ander heb je een bepaalde school gemeen en de ander ken je misschien weer vanuit een kerkgemeenschap

7014093 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7014094 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all

7014391 last year arkansas had darren mcfadden who finished second in heisman voting but they also had felix jones who came in and contributed

7014405 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7014406 its unbelievable to have the chance to represent the type of players and people we have on this team as their captain for another year
7014407 with the number of outstanding leaders we have on our team i will work to lead everyone in every way i can on and off the field
7014408 its a blessing first and foremost to be able to represent these players and this team
7014409 theres a lot of seniors a lot of guys who are considered leaders on this team and even though weve designated four captains that doesnt take away from all of those other guys they are going to continue to step up and be leaders too
7014410 its a great feeling to have that type of role in this football program youre part of something much bigger than yourself
7014411 this team is a very special collection of remarkable people thats why i came back for another year to be around these guys
7014412 while we continue our negotiations we are willing to offer the ohio state football games carried on the big ten network to our customers on a per game basis at a retail price set by you with 100 percent of the revenue going to you
7014413 now the decision is in ohio states hands we look forward to your immediate response
7014414 i want to make it so they have to make a decision
7014415 i made progress but i still have a long way to go
7014416 im really not happy with it theres nothing to be happy about its preseason the real games start in two weeks
7014417 i mean not really i want to have an impact
7014418 sixteen games anybody can play 16 games i mean i will be grateful to make it through the season and play 16 games thats my plan to make it through the season but to make it through the season and not make an impact wouldnt be enough
7014419 no i felt like i just took advantage of the opportunities i had
7014420 i didnt feel like i do too much special i could have done more some things got called back
7014421 thats a good feeling people excited to see what i do compared to people wondering why im still here
7014422 its heartbreaking right now i cant even sleep at night
7014423 im just taking it one day at a time it is my thigh im going to go get a second opinion
7014424 during practice its ok after practice its worse i just want to keep learning and stay football minded while im injured
7014425 i feel when i come back next year that i will get a chance i was able to do what i needed to do to make the football team this year i work hard and i think thats what they like im sick to my stomach i put in a lot of hard work i made 100 percent of my workouts in the offseason
7014426 i want to make it so they have to make a decision
7014427 i made progress but i still have a long way to go
7014428 im really not happy with it theres nothing to be happy about its preseason the real games start in two weeks
7014429 i mean not really i want to have an impact
7014430 sixteen games anybody can play 16 games i mean i will be grateful to make it through the season and play 16 games thats my plan to make it through the season but to make it through the season and not make an impact wouldnt be enough
7014431 no i felt like i just took advantage of the opportunities i had
7014432 i didnt feel like i do too much special i could have done more some things got called back

7014438 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7014439 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7014440 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7014441 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7014442 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7014443 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7014444 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7014445 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7014446 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7014447 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7014448 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7014449 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7014450 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7014451 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7014452 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7014453 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7014454 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7014455 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7014456 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7014457 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7014458 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7014459 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7014460 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7014461 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7014462 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7014463 who are open to doing something on the production side
7014464 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7014465 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7014466 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7014467 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7014468 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7014469 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7014470 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7014471 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7014472 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7014473 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7014474 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7014475 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7014476 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7014477 they know they cant win this thing without me and i love it
7014478 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7014479 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7014480 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7014481 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7014482 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7014483 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7014484 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7014485 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7014486 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7014487 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7014488 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7014489 die reedereien verabschieden sich einstweilen von der hochgeschwindigkeits philosophie von 25 bis 26 knoten 46 bis 48 km h
7014490 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7014491 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7014492 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7014493 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7014494 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7014495 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7014496 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7014497 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7014498 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7014499 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7014500 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7014501 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7014502 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7014503 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7014504 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7014505 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7014506 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7014507 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7014508 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7014509 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7014510 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7014511 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7014512 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7014513 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7014514 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7014515 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7014516 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7014517 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7014518 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7014519 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11

7014544 the dark clouds that have hung over the global economy have become denser during the summer as a result of growing concerns on the international financial markets
7014545 increased uncertainty has driven up interest rates at the same time as stock prices have fallen sharply and negatively affected households and companies around the world
7014546 at the same time inflation has increased because of a sharp rise in prices for food and energy among other things sweden is naturally affected by all of this
7014547 we are pleased to note that public finances have continued to improve
7014548 we are following the development and if they are looking for a provocation we will know how to avoid it

7014552 in the last few weeks the number of people getting in touch has shot up
7014553 this suggests that the summer months especially august are the time of year when many people consider ending a relationship
7014554 many of us find it easier to express a difficult message in writing which is why we think so many people feel that there is a gap in the market for this type of thing
7014555 we are following the development and if they are looking for a provocation we will know how to avoid it
7014556 millions are watching on television in britain and the enthusiasm and joy of the olympic events is rising every day so that when the team returns on monday they will have tremendous reception and ovation from the whole of the british people

7014563 from aston villas perspective gareth has played exceptionally well in the games he has played this season
7014564 i thought on sunday he did exceptionally well against man city in terms of his fitness it is getting there it has been a bit stop start for him because he hasnt had a real proper pre season
7014565 the uncertainty is there yet it hasnt looked to had any affect on him but if that is the opinion the england manager has then he is absolutely entitled to it
7014566 i would love to be able to not guarantee ashley young playing i would love to be able to say i couldnt guarantee gareth barry being in the team well we havent reached that stage yet

7014581 it is not a personal issue that i alone can make a decision all the independents will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision
7014582 when the upa government was formed earlier in jharkhand independents were first taken into confidence this time it was just opposite
7014583 no proposal for a better leadership was put before us or there were no convincing arguments given here as to why a change of leadership in required in jharkhand at all
7014584 our stand is the same we want koda as the chief minister
7014585 the real game will begin after his kodas resignation then it is the responsibility of jmm chief shibu soren and his men to ensure that the new government musters the required majority
7014586 bizarrely i want to take the boys to a third world country to make them appreciate what they have id like them to see how lucky they are to have so much compared to some

7014647 we examine the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation on algae and their protective mechanisms
7014648 our investigations show that the distribution of certain species of brown algae is inhibited by the climate of ultraviolet radiation the algae are displaced into deeper water layers if ultraviolet radiation increases

7014770 wir hatten unsere chancen im spiel haben es jedoch vers umt sie zu nutzen insgesamt kann ich mich nicht beschweren wie wir als mannschaft in diesem turnier aufgetreten sind es herrschte eine gute stimmung und wir waren die ganze zeit zusammen nat rlich w re der olympiasieg noch sch ner gewesen aber auch die silbermedaille kann uns niemand nehmen
7014771 wir k nnen stolz darauf sein was wir hier in peking geleistet haben vor dem finale wurde uns teilweise nicht der n tige respekt entgegengebracht und niemand hatte uns auf der rechnung letztlich k nnen wir jedoch stolz sein auf unsere leistungen in peking wir sind entt uscht dass wir das finale verloren haben aber wir werden mit sicherheit mit stolz auf unsere leistungen zur ckblicken
7014772 nur wenige haben uns zugetraut dass wir soweit kommen w rden und wir konnten sie eines besseren belehren
7014773 wir sind eine gro e familie und familien brechen niemals auseinander wenn einmal etwas schief geht wir k nnen alle stolz sein
7014774 wir essen und trinken zusammen und wir spielen zusammen wir machen alles als mannschaft wir hatten gute und schlechte momente und waren jetzt sehr lange beisammen ich bin heute sehr gl cklich nat rlich wollten wir nicht verlieren aber viele mannschaften mussten die heimreise mit leeren h nden antreten w hrend wir immerhin die silbermedaille gewonnen haben
7014775 allein die tatsache dass wir im finale der olympischen spiele standen ist etwas worauf wir stolz sein k nnen

7014782 bevor ich nach china gereist bin wurden viele dinge gesagt ber die ich mich ge rgert habe das ist wohl klar daher ist diese medaille f r mich etwas ganz besonderes
7014783 ich glaube dass argentinien hier gold gewonnen hat weil wir eine beeindruckende mannschaft mit gro em zusammenhalt hatten das haben wir auf dem spielfeld unter beweis gestellt
7014784 ich bin sehr gl cklich weil dies f r mich die letzte m glichkeit war an den olympischen spielen teilzunehmen das finale war vielleicht nicht gerade unterhaltsam aber solche spiele muss man einfach gewinnen und punkt jetzt werde ich mit der medaille um den hals nach hause fliegen und keiner soll es wagen sie mir abzunehmen
7014785 ja der gesamten truppe die ber einen monat fern von der familie gemeinsam auf dieses ziel hingearbeitet und es nie aus den augen verloren hat diese goldmedaille ist einfach sensationell
7014786 its become the centre of a maelstrom and international media attention
7014787 i learned when i was a boy that the chief end of man was to glorify god and enjoy him forever but i hear now according to the new theology that the chief end of god is to glorify man and enjoy him forever yet this is the turning of things upside down
7014788 if the gospel were more faithfully preached there would be fewer people professing to believe it

7014796 se alla gente piace avere cd senza faccia nella loro collezione buon per loro sarebbe ridicolo per una rockstar chiedere alla gente di pagare per un album per il quale i ragazzi non hanno abbastanza soldi quindi se lo trovano gratis avanti ma non fatelo con gli oasis perch contro la legge

7014800 members have rightly grown angry at the scandalous refusal to pay them the same as other emergency service workers and by the governments policy to cap public sector pay increases below inflation
7014801 strike action is a last resort for our members who provide an invaluable service in ensuring the safety of shipping in british waters
7014802 the latest action could have been avoided if the government and the mca hadnt continued with their refusal to negotiate a satisfactory outcome

7014837 the day that the disappearance of the indigenous communities in the jungles and mountains was avoided
7014838 this is a new dawn for the people of this country and for all peruvians who wish to develop in freedom not in oppression
7014839 if that were to happen out of fear of protesters fear of unrest peru would some day remember it as the moment when change came to a halt and hundreds of thousands of people were condemned to poverty exclusion and marginalisation
7014840 i wanted to see if it hurt as much as it did the first time
7014841 the strike is part of continuing protests against indias rule in kashmir
7014842 it is also to demand our right to self determination through a referendum
7014843 the fighting that is still raging has so far left five militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7014844 step in the right direction but the problem is that in iraq there are so many parties so many factions
7014845 the war in iraq has been long and difficult and thousands of families have paid the ultimate price during its course
7014846 the fact that an agreement between the iraqi and u s governments is so close is a reflection of the sacrifice bravery and commitment of our troops and their families our troops will be able to return having achieved real results a stable democratic iraq that can defend itself they are to be commended for their service
7014847 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7014848 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7014849 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7014850 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats

7014861 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world

7014884 write or invite was the perfect opportunity to expand our business with something that we truly enjoy
7014885 i have always had a passion for scrapbooking card making and stationary and peri is an expert in current fashions and trends
7014886 we brought in thousands of new items from invitations for every occasion to fun gifts and of course unique travel items
7014887 most importantly we made the environment inviting and enjoyable for our customers the store now has a personality that speaks to our tastes for both fashion and fun
7014888 we knew there were other people like us who were looking for unique stationary and invitations but didnt have many options among local businesses
7014889 no matter what the occasion we put our creative minds together to design and print invitations place cards party gifts and thank you cards that bring it all together

7014895 you may think that personalized stationary or invitations are out of your budget but we can create them for very reasonable prices

7014914 the iraqi government wants this agreement to be valid just for three years
7014915 the full withdrawal will depend on the situation on the ground and the needs of iraqis and the decisions of the iraqi government
7014916 yes i was shocked when we heard bombs even here in tbilisi i have so many russian friends even russian relatives weve talked about it
7014917 they feel as bad about it as we do its awkward for them should i hold it against them of course not
7014918 ethnic russians havent had any major problems so far maybe some minor problems and only in the town of gori
7014919 i am afraid that after all this time all these years russia could have spoiled things for us
7014920 my friends all are angry about the russians no georgian will go up to a russian and insult him or abuse him were not like that but there is this feeling give it time and it will go away i hope
7014921 i grew up in soviet times i went to moscow so often i loved the girls
7014922 the towns half empty now so many people are away at their country houses on holiday

7014924 carl lewis won four events in 1984 but it was not the same impression on us
7014925 it was not with a world record it is the difference
7014926 he is good and great for our sport he can help to build up our sport
7014927 i was a little bit prepared for something around 9 70 in the 100 but this was not expected
7014928 i thought he would make the record but not this time
7014929 he was fantastic we are very privileged to have this
7014930 i was so scared because bombs were falling on our homes but now it seems people will start returning and everything will be alright
7014931 but it seems that peace is coming back to our town and i think they will also come back soon
7014932 we will be negotiating with them about the number and location of checkpoints in the future

7014937 everything is working brilliantly and we are all overjoyed about how it has gone
7014938 bei den reaktionen der politiker sind leider auch ein paar schnellsch sse dabei gewesen
7014939 was a strange choice for the government to pick if it was seeking to learn how to get the truth from detainees it was founded during the cold war in an effort to re create and therefore understand the mistreatment that had led 36 captured u s airmen to give stunningly false confessions during the korean war
7014940 but there are so many different types of treatments out there you have to be realistic about it and you have to stay positive because if you become too negative its hard to climb back up that mountain
7014941 i guess it was lying but i didnt want the word to get out because i didnt want it to define who i am
7014942 but it also refers to the person i used to be the other woman who was in constant pain having a problem getting around doing day to day things that people sometimes take for granted such as opening a door buttoning a shirt brushing your teeth and hair
7014943 awesome i wish i was 20 because i feel like it
7014944 lets get lost is a dynamic view inside our lifestyle and showcases the spring collection beautifully
7014945 like the collection the film is reminiscent yet modern relaxed yet edgy taryn shows a playful and carefree side and also has a creative determined rebellious and independent side the clothes we see her wearing throughout the film reflect her different points of view and the music completes the overall vibe we couldnt have achieved this through photographs in a traditional lookbook the film tells so much more
7014946 i have been a frankie b fan since daniella started the line ten years ago so i was thrilled when she asked me to be a part of this film
7014947 i love how sexy the clothes are and that they have a 70s inspired design the jeans fit my body really well and are extremely flattering theyre so comfortable that i sometimes forget im wearing jeans
7014948 all anti authoritarians anarchists and all those against states nations and borders to join the freedom of movement bloc and to play a trick or two on those clowns in the labour party circus lets collectively imagine a world without borders and wars and fight together to realise this

7014953 i request them to organise this fair more than once a year this fair should be given more encouragement

7014959 i am in madrid to organize the transfer of the body i have to wait for the resutls of the dna tests and dental records in order to take the body to brazil
7014960 my parents are very depressed my mother has taken it very badly
7014961 i saw the scenes of the accident on television but i didnt know my brother was on that plane
7014962 it was my brothers father in law who contacted some friends in sao paulo to tell us that they had both died in the accident
7014963 our priority now is to bring his body home quickly
7014964 a light has come on but i dont know what it means
7014965 he the captain said a light had come on but he didnt know what it meant

7014970 the pilot detected something when he took the plane off the runway he believed it was resolved if he decided to take off
7014971 the problem was located it was resolved and the plane was dispatched
7014972 the technician who inspected the plane was not able to repair the system
7014973 the solution was to disconnect it not to repair it
7014974 the accident may have been impossible to predict or there might have been negligence
7014975 if the take off was authorised without the fault being properly repaired there is clearly a legal responsibility
7014976 but that must all be cleared up before any decisions are taken
7014977 it will have to be seen which company did the inspection whether it is a company with staff from the same company spanair or from a subcontractor
7014978 and if it was the same company what official controls took place

7015034 it was my brothers father in law who contacted some friends in sao paulo to tell us that they had both died in the accident
7015035 our priority now is to bring his body home quickly
7015036 a light has come on but i dont know what it means
7015037 he the captain said a light had come on but he didnt know what it meant
7015038 suddenly the plane started to shake it was going from one side to the other until it fell
7015039 later i just remember people on the ground smoke explosions and then i lost consciousness
7015040 i was saved by the paramedics its thanks to them that im alive i feel like ive been born again
7015041 the failure of one motor does not cause an accident im not so sure the engine failed the combination of causes will have to be determined
7015042 the pilot detected something when he took the plane off the runway he believed it was resolved if he decided to take off
7015043 the problem was located it was resolved and the plane was dispatched
7015044 the technician who inspected the plane was not able to repair the system
7015045 the solution was to disconnect it not to repair it
7015046 the accident may have been impossible to predict or there might have been negligence
7015047 if the take off was authorised without the fault being properly repaired there is clearly a legal responsibility
7015048 but that must all be cleared up before any decisions are taken
7015049 it will have to be seen which company did the inspection whether it is a company with staff from the same company spanair or from a subcontractor
7015050 and if it was the same company what official controls took place
7015051 wow you people are unbelievable a family member writes in that the woman leaves behind four grieving children and a husband and still you are relentless
7015052 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7015053 barack ha escogido al senador joe biden como nuestro candidato a vicepresidente
7015054 estoy contento de que joe biden se sume a la campa a pero no podemos hacerlo solos necesitamos vuestra ayuda para construir este movimiento para el cambio
7015055 no ha habido hasta ahora peor cr tico de la falta de experiencia de barack obama que el propio joe biden
7015056 biden ha denunciado el escaso juicio pol tico de obama en pol tica exterior y ha criticado personalmente lo que los estadounidenses est n empezando a constatar que barack obama no est listo para ser presidente
7015057 el respeto di logo colaboraci n y apertura a todos los sectores deportivos
7015058 where is her office and would she want to have some lunch tomorrow
7015059 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7015060 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7015061 we still have some work to do heading into the washington game but overall ive been very pleased with our teams mind set and composure during this fall camp
7015062 he had some pretty big holes to run through but proved how difficult he is going to be to bring down in the open field
7015063 da ist licht am tunnel und ich glaube nicht dass es das des entgegenkommenden zugs ist
7015064 es sind vor allem nationale und internationale investoren die auf wohn und gewerbeimmobilien setzen und auf steigenden mieten hoffen
7015065 die reichen der welt kommen nach berlin und kaufen sich hier ein kein wunder bei den im internationalen vergleich g nstigen immobilienpreisen
7015066 das hatten wir in berlin schon in den 90er jahren das liegt hinter uns
7015067 beim stahl gibt es inzwischen praktisch ein oligopol das f hrt dazu dass bestimmtes material beispielsweise spezialst hle ber monate nicht verf gbar ist
7015068 berlin hat die chancen zu einem dreh und angelpunkt des warentransports in mitteleuropa zu werden aber daf r m sste man deutlich mehr geld vor allem in die wasserstra en und schienenwege stecken

7015071 dieses zentrale register hat sich als wertvolle unterst tzung bei der pr fung des verdachts auf verletzung der schulpflicht erwiesen

7015074 the yankees were unable to gain any ground on the wild card leading red sox bostons 8 4 win over toronto left the bombers six games out of a playoff spot with 34 games to go
7015075 no he tenido el tiempo para prepararme lo suficiente pero montar la coreograf a es lo m s dif cil porque aunque tenga clara la t cnica a la hora de pelear con una campeona mundial ya te imaginar s lo hago con todo el respeto y el cari o a lo que significa el boxeo en general y para mis compa eras creo que la novela hace un homenaje a lo que es el boxeo
7015076 estuve mucho tiempo platicando con ellas para romper el clich de que las boxeadoras no son machorras son femeninas chambeadoras y con ganas de hacer cosas y se es mi personaje quiero que represente a esa persona que tiene car cter que es femenina y dulce
7015077 mucha gente tiene la mentalidad sic que este deporte no es para mujeres se dar n cuenta que es diferente y abajo del ring podemos ser femeninas

7015079 el box y la lucha son una manera de estar bien yo creo que s es una forma de inculcarlo adem s de estar bien en todos los aspectos como con la familia o la pareja en estos momentos de inseguridad que estamos viviendo que es asquerosa

7015081 i just posted the last chapter we had left to write profiling and optimisation please get your comments in by the end of tuesday september 2 the response to the previous two has been excellent we appreciate your help and careful reading
7015082 the man is a superstar some people are born into this world who are just superstars
7015083 the ability flintoff has with that cricket ball when he bowls is absolutely phenomenal
7015084 he can bowl in practice with one arm and still hit a length and im fortunate to have a bloke like that who i can ask to knock the stumps over at the death and he bowls those kind of deliveries at the death hes brilliant
7015085 this is the stage he belongs on not playing for durham in front of 34 people he should be playing in front of 34 000 40 000 or 50 000 thats where steve harmison belongs
7015086 steve wants to play for england he wants to play on the biggest stage which is where hes performing on at the moment
7015087 theres some really positive stuff happening in english cricket at the moment but theres no point getting ahead of ourselves because we start every series well
7015088 don bradmans test average 99 94 runs per dismissal is entrenched in australian folklore and the story of the dons final innings out for a duck when just four runs would have taken his average to 100 has been told countless times
7015089 just four runs spread over a career of almost 20 years and more than 197 hours at the crease it is worth asking just how sure can we be that the number is correct
7015090 as it happens my recent research has shown that it could be wrong a tantalising clue to four missing runs has been found
7015091 the relevant sections of bill fergusons original score are illustrated there are four runs attributed to ryder that are in the wrong place in both the batting section of the score and in the bowling section maurice tates 35th over there is no doubt that a recording error of some kind has occurred so where do these runs belong
7015092 perhaps ryder scored them at some other point of the innings perhaps they were not scored at all in which case australia technically did not win the match more importantly perhaps they were scored by bradman just perhaps
7015093 you will not find a scorebook that says bradman scored x when the accepted score is y it is more subtle a batsmans strokes may not add up to his score or more commonly there are mismatches between strokes attributed to batsmen and the strokes marked against bowlers
7015094 there are surviving scorebooks for many tests of the past all but seven of bradmans tests are represented preserved in libraries at lords cricket nsw and elsewhere
7015095 there are a number of possible resolutions to the question over ryders four runs in that melbourne test of 1928 29 they are complicated by the presence of an unmarked leg bye
7015096 at least one resolution involves transferring the boundary to bradman
7015097 most of bradmans scorebooks have not been checked at this level of detail it is painstaking work however the chances of finding other anomalies based on experience with many other scores seem high
7015098 el piloto les dijo que fallaba el motor izquierdo y que no

7015102 fulham have a strong squad and their team look more dangerous going forwards than they did last year if you add to that it will be a derby you want a game where you have complete focus
7015103 we know the success of our season is based on how quickly we can focus again on club targets after international games
7015104 i believe that emmanuel has been unfairly treated because he had a lot of interest from many big clubs and he always told me one to one his preference was to stay in the end he stayed
7015105 that story did not come out like that in the press and unfortunately he is paying a price for a story which is not really him
7015106 he made a press conference in austria where people interpreted his statements a bit differently but i know what he told me and i know he made sacrifices to stay
7015107 i was convinced he wanted to stay but i was not always convinced he would stay because there is a big difference in that
7015108 people have advisors and some clubs pay higher wages than we do we have to accept that
7015109 it is a tricky enough game anyway but we are aware there might be a backlash from the portsmouth
7015110 we have played them a couple of times already in pre season which maybe helps a bit because it is important to get that win
7015111 the manager has a few more things to deal with with us coming back from international week but we do not want to give other teams a head start
7015112 hopefully i will be here as long as the manager wants me
7015113 it is a squad game now and i am happy here doing what i am doing
7015114 when i get in it is a case of making sure i do enough to give the manager a difficult decision to leave me out the next time that is the challenge i face every time i play
7015115 we have to keep our concentration and begin by winning a match against a great team at home we are obliged to do things right
7015116 valencia will be ambitious and will go for the game we have to play with the attitude that we have a real chance of winning the supercup
7015117 real madrid will change at the santiago bernabeu and will be a team which pushes harder we want to be the same home and away but that wont always be achieved
7015118 we are having a meeting next wednesday about a lot of things and contracts will be one of the things discussed
7015119 there are other players to discuss as well im fairly relaxed about it but i will know more when we sit down
7015120 these things happen the main thing at the end of the day is that it will be sorted
7015121 you will produce a finalized design by xhristmas and it will be criticized and you will go away and redesign improve it for end of february
7015122 the man is a superstar some people are born into this world who are just superstars
7015123 the ability flintoff has with that cricket ball when he bowls is absolutely phenomenal
7015124 he can bowl in practice with one arm and still hit a length and im fortunate to have a bloke like that who i can ask to knock the stumps over at the death and he bowls those kind of deliveries at the death hes brilliant
7015125 this is the stage he belongs on not playing for durham in front of 34 people he should be playing in front of 34 000 40 000 or 50 000 thats where steve harmison belongs
7015126 steve wants to play for england he wants to play on the biggest stage which is where hes performing on at the moment
7015127 theres some really positive stuff happening in english cricket at the moment but theres no point getting ahead of ourselves because we start every series well
7015128 though perhaps as a friendly gesture they could warn mr mccain of the dangers of mr hikinds extreme ideas
7015129 i personally want the democratic party and its nominee senator barack obama to have a worthy opponent not a person who accepts support from such an unworthy source as dov hikind
7015130 i was involved with rabbi kahane and have no regrets
7015131 ive always made it very clear i got involved when the issues were anti semitism jewish poor things that were in america
7015132 either ignorant or trying to sear me with a label which is a clear mccarthy tactic
7015133 i dont know where the governors going but hes going big places
7015134 hes young hes going to be around playing a role and talking this straight talk
7015135 ive been elected 13 times by a 90 percent democrat community of 150 000 jews and non jews im running for reelection this year as a proud democrat but not a blind one for me its about supporting people whom i think are best i support republicans and many democrats
7015136 when it comes to politics crossing party lines is a greater sin than being a crook
7015137 willingness to look beyond party politics and support a candidate in whom he believes
7015138 i wanna talk to dad and tell him that i have had good behavior
7015139 take me out to the ballgame buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks i dont care if i never come back
7015140 god still has me around for a reason to win a funeral
7015141 im going to pick a spot under a tree out of the texas heat
7015142 and lets hope its a pet free cemetery i dont want to get watered on
7015143 we understand the essence of the russian position and its military response
7015144 i filed this action at this time to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7015145 for me im able to be persuaded and often if i believe that the evidence is strong then im happy to change my mind and thats what ive done
7015146 the job of the police association now will be to monitor the transition from the antiquated revolver to the semi automatic pistol
7015147 we hope that transition will occur in a timely manner
7015148 the current revolver goes back to the days of gallipoli
7015149 we are going to see a mass shooting in tasmania unless we get national gun control laws
7015150 i became aware that the only 2 local police were dispatched to saltwater river i was chatting to the nubeena policeman and he told me where he was when the shooting began his name is paul hyland the other policeman was stationed at dunalley he would back up hyland as they were told heroin soap powder was found at saltwater river
7015151 this meant that the only 2 local police were at least 25 minutes away from port arthur very convenient i dont know when where or who rang and alerted the police to this so called heroin haul
7015152 i know it should have been on tape but i went to hobart about a week after the shooting to a meeting of the ambulance service a comment was made to me that the tape recordings of the days events had been accidentally wiped the chap who told me was a senior ambulance officer i travelled with him to the meeting and it was during this journey that i was given this information
7015153 would also prevent anyone from leaving the peninsula including those involved in executing the massacre at port arthur
7015154 the bridge remained open to traffic after the massacre and several people are known to have left port arthur and escaped across that swing bridge
7015155 there was some suggestion that there may be two suspects it appeared at one stage that two gunmen or some people or hostages at seascape were exchanging gunfire with the gunmen as there appeared to be shots coming from two separate buildings
7015156 your honour nothing that i can say on behalf of my client can mitigate the outrageous nature of his conduct
7015157 i felt intensely that i had to do right by the community as well
7015158 whatever you do remember that the most important thing is to always be flexible
7015159 we are absolutely confident he will be found alive and well floating somewhere in the ocean
7015160 he knew what he was doing and was fully prepared for any kind of mishap
7015161 to his loving friends colleagues and fans we appreciate your heartfelt prayers and support charlton heston was seen by the world as larger than life no one could ask for a fuller life than his no man could have given more to his family to his profession and to his country in his own words i have lived such a wonderful life ive lived enough for two people
7015162 if you go back and look at the way its developed and built that is really a funny character
7015163 hes a fumbler with all kinds of inhibitions and fears thats the way we built that character
7015164 was the first movie to earn 100 million at the box office
7015165 ive been fortunate to do what i consider three landmark films
7015166 jaws was the first big blockbuster outdoor adventure film and certainly all that jazz is not like any old mgm musical each one of these films is unique and i consider myself fortunate to be associated with them
7015167 richard dreyfuss who co starred with scheider and robert shaw in
7015168 a knockaround actor to me is a compliment that means a professional that lives the life of a professional actor and doesnt yell and scream at the fates and does his job and does it as well as he can
7015169 there was no evidence of violent premortum trauma to the skull
7015170 but there is a possible femoral fracture that may have led to his death
7015171 this is the first ever ct evaluation of an identified ancient royal mummy
7015172 head of army while he was poisoned by wary enemies recent days scientists say napoleon bonaparte died from an advanced case of gastric cancer and not arsenic poisoning as some had speculated
7015173 my own professional instinct instructs me that sirhan somehow killed senator kennedy alone
7015174 for two years after that picture you couldnt get me to smile i played the part the way i did because the script struck me as funny and the part i played made me laugh the guy was such a ridiculous beast
7015175 i know ive made kind of a half assed career out of violence but i abhor violence
7015176 i am an ardent supporter of gun control it seems incredible to me that we are the only civilized nation that does not put some effective control on guns
7015177 i have a high forehead he thought i looked too intellectual
7015178 she wanted to be this great star but acting just scared the hell out of her thats why she was always late couldnt get her on the set she had trouble remembering lines but none of it mattered with a very few special people something happens between the lens and the film that is pure magic and she really had it
7015179 like most small town boys i had the urge to get to the big city and make a name for myself
7015180 i was a movie nut from the age of 3 but i dont recall having any interest in acting
7015181 ive discovered in my dotage that i now find the whole moviemaking process irritating i dont have the patience anymore ive got a few more years to live and i dont want to spend them sitting around a movie set for 12 hours to do two minutes of film
7015182 its really the free world against the lying cheating hypocritical russians
7015183 certainly he was the greatest chess player that every lived and he was famous because of what he did on the chess board but he was certainly infamous for what he did off the chess board
7015184 he just sort of went bad he went mean in the latter part of his life
7015185 we have about 50 000 flagged as famous or notable and its a contentious issue of who makes the list but we try to be accommodating
7015186 certainly theres that fascination with those people who die ahead of schedule
7015187 its something that people have been doing as long as theyve been traveling really to go and honor and pay respects to some figure whos been really really important in your life for one reason or another
7015188 it just takes a kind of a bizarre twist in a place like hollywood where the magnificence and the extravagance of the lives of these people is carried on into death
7015189 hes ready to move in next to marilyn when the time comes
7015190 were very protective of that place and the families we assist
7015191 there are some who just would prefer that we dont say a lot about a particular celebrity who is buried there
7015192 op dit moment zien we niet genoeg marktpotentie voor een nederlandse speler
7015193 ons beleid is nu zodanig dat nu even geen nieuwe spelers willen aantrekken

7015196 lummis had constructed a home for himself in arroyo seco which he named el alisal it became a personal museum where lummis began to accumulate his own collection of artifacts and research materials when site selection for the southwest museum began in 1905 various locations were considered some with great financial inducements but lummis was adamant that the only choice could be the hillside property visible from el alisal with a commanding view of arroyo seco and far beyond the 38 acre site was located on a transportation line between pasadena and los angeles accessible by the yellow car line and also by auto along pasadena avenue later renamed figueroa street

7015222 tavoitteet olivat korkealla joten t m oli hirve pettymys harmittaa kun ei pystynyt olympialaisissa tekem n nappisuoritusta
7015223 sono state due sessioni di prove libere divertenti con i tempi che scendevano con rapidita man mano che i piloti giravano e prendevano confidenza con il tracciato lasfalto e ancora molto sporco ed e facile commettere degli errori che fanno perdere decimi preziosi per fare un buon tempo devi essere prefetto mi piace la pista ce una bella atmosfera e devo dire che gli organizzatori hanno fatto un buon lavoro oggi era importante trovare subito un buon assetto di partenza e ci siamo riusciti
7015224 wenn einige schon nach zwei spielen die geduld verlieren kann ich nur mit dem kopf sch tteln man muss weiter auf diese mannschaft setzen sie braucht noch zeit
7015225 wir h tten noch drei tage spielen k nnen und der ball w re nicht reingegangen
7015226 es war wichtig dass wir wieder zu dem spiel zur ckgefunden haben das uns stark macht wir waren sehr lauffreudig und diszipliniert

7015228 its the worst thing that could happen to stop at the olympics
7015229 im going to go home and im going to have a little moment like oh my god i lost third
7015230 but you know i made decision that whatever happens i wasnt going to feel like i lost third i won fourth
7015231 when i got back on my bike my pulse and my breathing just went very high
7015232 it was an awesome race it was amazing out there
7015233 unfortunately i had a bit of trouble shifting on the last climb and irina was right on my wheel i had to put a foot down she got by me and that was bronze
7015234 i tried not to look at it during the race because its just too scary to know that your heart rate is 185 or whatever
7015235 i wonder if i should have made a move earlier on my husband was definitely yelling at me to but i felt like i did what i could at the point in the race and thats the way i had to race it
7015236 ive got lots of time ahead of me to try and come back and do it again
7015237 thats mountain biking its part of the game flat tires happen mechanicals happen all the time it just sucks that it happens at the olympics

7015277 criminal networks can profit by collecting e waste in developed countries such as canada and selling it to recyclers in developing nations
7015278 this practice is a violation of both canadian and international law
7015279 one of the reasons organized crime has been as successful as it is is that theyre very adaptable and its not like theyve given up any of their traditional markets
7015280 if it wasnt lucrative organized crime groups wouldnt be involved in it
7015281 were realizing that in terms of sales of laptops and electronic devices to organized crime there is often damage to the environment and its a national concern
7015282 canadian forests are vulnerable to illegal harvesting due to their relative abundance isolation and the large number of logging access roads
7015283 the illegal trade in wildlife can be as profitable as dealing in narcotics
7015284 we have in canada an abundant supply on the one hand of natural resources including fisheries and forestry
7015285 but we have all seen that overexploitation of natural resources can have dramatic effects
7015286 theres no such thing as a post olympic budget for sponsors out there so unless you have endorsements coming into a games the million dollars isnt going to show up
7015287 its not the olympic success that makes or breaks a professional career its something ive worked pretty hard at
7015288 that will probably cover their debt and its certainly not going to put them into the money
7015289 its a hell of a time not to have it its the worst 1 000 ive put together in years
7015290 it was only when i crossed the finish line that i realized adam was back and that was a big surprise new zealands ben fouhy who took fourth place told ctv news
7015291 i went quiet i think the stands told it that we went quiet it was unexpected
7015292 it was really tough to see him not to succeed because it doesnt happen often
7015293 he had a very strong pickup at the 500 and i countered it went with him a little while and then people just started blowing past me and i couldnt handle it
7015294 he went there clouded with political messgaes before the olympics
7015295 by his own wisdom and providence has created his holy church which he has blessed
7015296 you will tell therefore those who preside over the church to direct their ways in righteousness that they may receive in full the promises with great glory
7015297 there are lawyers and others who are gaming the system sometimes perhaps at the instruction of their clients to seek out delays for as long as possible so that the day of reckoning is postponed as long as possible
7015298 i think weve got to crack down on both of those weve got to supply the resources and stop people from gaming the system and i think thatll make a big difference

7015307 dr thaksin is embarrassed about the indignity brought on all the entities the club the premier league he never intended this
7015308 he has said to me if you need me to resign from the
7015309 no player will be kept here against their will this does not mean that madrid will not defend the interests of the club
7015310 im sure that robinho has already weighed up the consequences of his decision and im sure that in the next few days he will give a letter to the club to announce that he wants to go if he does not want to be here he should leave as soon as possible
7015311 i can tell you that madrid are not going to transfer robinho we are not going to sell him if he wants to go then he should go now telling the press about it is not the right way to do things
7015312 its not necessarily that he will have to pay the 150million he would end his contract but the courts will decide what he has to pay
7015313 nobody is obliged to stay here but we will defend our interests
7015314 this is what we announced publicly on our webpage he should leave as soon as possible but he must accept the consequences of rescinding his contract when it has two years remaining
7015315 i hear that we wants to go well he will have to give notice in writing
7015316 no because the transfers need to be done at the end of the competition not five days before the start of the season

7015318 theres no question that rising fuel prices have been driving utility bills higher
7015319 they cant just say coal went up so give us money
7015320 they have to prove what theyre saying if its a cost of fuel its documented and theyre buying it they have a right to request for a rate increase
7015321 what is true is that we dont have adequate infrastructure
7015322 the whole reason electricity has been affordable as a utility not a luxury is that we could get it to as many people as possible all the time that totally depends on generating it in one place and moving it to another
7015323 some states that didnt have the need to be all that efficient are now learning it
7015324 the specter of climate legislation makes it difficult to make decisions and get financing all of these issues are making efficiency the best option because people recognize this is not an interim thing
7015325 the american way is to figure out the silver bullet and fire away

7015352 it is normal actually for him not to come back
7015353 it is an unfortunate comment at this time especially when we are driving young people to become more involved
7015354 we have to see it in the glory of their moment and give it to them
7015355 we have to allow the personality of youth to express itself
7015356 he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made

7015358 hindus have never invaded another country and never tried to impose their religion upon others
7015359 the potential of mega events such as the olympic games to foster cooperation and dialogue among the worlds peoples and nations is indisputable
7015360 oppose use of threats fear and swindles and other methods to carry out evictions
7015361 everytime big events like the world cup the olympic games etc come it is the grassroots the poor people who are the worst damaged and worst affected but we could not prevent that situation in seoul and the sacrifice was more than we imagined so the key is to prevent this from happening make sure the government does not let it happen that way we must call on the government to make sure we dont make poor peoples lives worse
7015362 we should tell our decision makers that if you cant do this to share the benefits then dont do it at all let the normal problems that are facing us be part of it you dont have to pretend that they dont exist poor and homeless exist everywhere
7015363 make the olympic games neutral in its impact upon humanity ensure no one is worse off by the olympic games you must be willing to make a commitment to house no less than the percentage of your population that is poor in the year after putting in a bid ensure no less numbers will be housed after the olympic games no passing the buck
7015364 make sure that whoever is going to be affected they have the power the power is with them give a guarantee that if you are going to tear down 100 units build more for poor people let the poor people be in the majority give them the vote

7015366 there must be other ways of resolving the poverty problems of the people
7015367 it should not involve leaders who are only interested in seeking positions but do not carry out studies because certain people have different political ideologies and thus are left out in the end we cannot resolve the poverty problem
7015368 the malays themselves are divided into the umno malays pas malays and pkr malays and even among the umno malays they are divided into several groups

7015373 the opening of the limnitis checkpoint is not connected to any other matter
7015374 we condemn all kinds of provocative actions that take place in that sensitive village of pyla wherever these may come from
7015375 our position regarding the issue of opening the limnitis checkpoint is well known and is not connected to anything else
7015376 we are working for the opening of the particular checkpoint as soon as possible because it will serve both the greek cypriots and the turkish cypriots in the area
7015377 the repetition of the well known stance of the greek cypriots and the extension of the claims of the greek cypriot side for suzerainty on the island

7015391 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7015392 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7015393 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7015394 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7015395 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7015396 the owners were interested in selling and we thought it was a valuable addition to our holdings

7015399 but the greens and tees have healed over with exotic invasive plants

7015401 the last couple of years weve had some guys on the ready ready and got them ready to go and tried not to play them
7015402 sometimes were successful doing that and thats probably what well do again
7015403 typically by at least those first couple of games youd like to be able to get some things sorted out
7015404 the pros are i get better for a year and i still have four years of eligibility and i can help out the team and the defense
7015405 ive played some scout team and its actually a lot of fun im enjoying it over there and i can already feel myself getting better i think its a big plus
7015406 the con is obviously i wanted to play but ill come out next year if i do redshirt and ill blow it up
7015407 you get to compete against the no 1 defense and we just have fun out there
7015408 i dont want to say its more relaxed but theres less pressure and you just get the ball and you run with it
7015409 i dont think anyone has really taken the job yet
7015410 thats a combination of things but were just waiting to see whos going to take the job i think the coaches are waiting for the same thing
7015411 i think its not going to be until offensive line coach jeff grimes feels comfortable with who hes got and i dont know when thats going to be
7015412 were trying to get much better execution from everybody clearly in terms of turnovers theyve been limited he knows whats going on i think hes been able to assert himself as a little bit more as a leader and help lead the offense that way from that standpoint hes been better
7015413 we made some changes put amy ekart back behind the plate we were driving the ball and thats what weve been lacking
7015414 we knew they were going to bunt and i would have done the same thing keep doing it until we figure it out thats a good team
7015415 we came out with a positive attitude everyone was in it and we did our jobs
7015416 i struggle a bit but i see it and just hit it i feel like i have to do as good as cervantes and i can do it
7015417 we dont have the speed we can live with that if the defense plays well behind us
7015418 when opponents have scored runs its because theyve had freebies or our pitchers have said ill let them hit it and we didnt make the play behind them
7015419 you just go so high it gives your stomach butterflies
7015420 it was fun except for the rash on my belly
7015421 we always have fun when we come to the artwalk and i thought this would be similar
7015422 people run into neighbors they havent seen all summer it just has great community support
7015423 i dont think you should ever be set at any position guys have to keep playing keep competing and theres always a health factor in there
7015424 the proofs in the pudding when you get to colorado state
7015425 its hard im always the worst one to ask because its always that next sort of step but the tempo has been good theyve hustled we got a lot of stuff in were doing a lot more than we ever have before
7015426 cody hasnt turned the ball over much which has been great
7015427 people understand the fall festival would be difficult with the construction and with the traffic issues at fickel park
7015428 were trying to do some activities and have some features down here
7015429 we try to play something that has a strong beat
7015430 you guys need to be a little bit more vigilant
7015431 we still moved the ball and i thought that the line did a great job with the running game we were struggling to complete some balls we werent able to make big plays our running game kept us in there
7015432 obviously i just threw it up in the air and gave him a chance
7015433 were going back to the drawing board and were seeing some gaps that we missed in practice
7015434 we were able to do some good things against them out there
7015435 we were able to make some plays when we needed to and weve just got to get better
7015436 well have to see if he needs to have surgery
7015437 i really think im going to be on this team and if i dont make this team it just wasnt meant to be
7015438 this is the first time really where im questioning myself making the team
7015439 normally going into the fourth preseason game i didnt even play i was one of the main guys and i sat on the sidelines
7015440 at the same time i accept the challenge and im not worried about getting cut or anything like that
7015441 hopefully i went out there and did enough to impress the coaches
7015442 i had my time to shine i played in a super bowl this is my 11th year i was a starter before right now im a role player and just trying to accept my role whatever it is i can just come in and make plays off the bench
7015443 i came to believe he has a depth of character and leadership our country and world are pining for and ready for
7015444 im really looking forward to invesco and witnessing history being made
7015445 if im going to stand up for what i believe in id better register as a democrat
7015446 i really did jump in with both feet and havent let go
7015447 itll be different for me because this year im not in the minority
7015448 he really gets it he really understands what our nation needs
7015449 he knows and is willing to stand up for whats right
7015450 ive come to realize the democratic party is more progressive and many of the issues that really matter the ones that really really matter are things that democrats hit on the head

7015457 the pirah s isolation is due to their very strong sense of superiority and disdain for other cultures far from thinking of themselves as inferior because they lack counting they consider their way of life the best possible way of life and so theyre not interested in assimilating other values

7015491 probably 90 percent of the games were good games and close and down to the wire and the crowds were into it
7015492 i think its a real shame theyre not going to have baseball in the 2012 olympics and i think it needs to come back its a summer sport and its one of the main sports in the world during the summer
7015493 it doesnt seem right weve had good crowds the whole time people have been into it i really do believe its going to be back in 2016 especially if its in chicago or tokyo baseball is too important to both america and japan to have it not be in there
7015494 we have a lot of guys on our club that have been in the major leagues
7015495 and guys that are going to be in the big leagues eventually i really think its a shame that was said that big leaguers have to be on the team for baseball to come back
7015496 but we didnt bring it back i feel sorry about this we have never experienced such a tough time before
7015497 i experienced a lot through the game but it doesnt mean much if we dont have victory
7015498 i think we as a team feel pretty good about what weve accomplished
7015499 the teams that are going to be playing for gold and silver are obviously very good clubs overall were pretty happy to going to be going home with something

7015511 theyre a historic tragedy waiting to happen said damien goodmon coordinator for the ucas fix expo campaign
7015512 off the table he then ordered both sides to reopen negotiations
7015513 during the past two weeks we have had longer lines
7015514 our wait times are higher than normal we are experiencing some backlog
7015515 each one may not constitute a full time worker but they help hundreds of thousands of people that come into the offices
7015516 you cut them out whether or not they are a part time or full time employee you still cut a full employee
7015517 the lines are always long because the state legislature never funds them enough

7015519 the deir fails to adequately address and or identify a number of significant environmental impacts
7015520 we feel theres not sufficient detail and rationale to make some of these conclusions
7015521 theres not enough justification to determine less than significant impacts with application of mitigation measures in the eir
7015522 theres not enough characterization of previous health assessments of the site those results should have been included
7015523 the eir analysis of pxps proposed csd is totally inadequate
7015524 additional time itself is not going to be a great benefit if the process isnt honest the work needs to be done right in order to ensure we have community standards that are protective of the health and safety of the community

7015526 the bus station is likely to have been busy at this time of night and i would appeal to anyone who might have seen the two suspects before or after the incident to come forward as they may have important information to this inquiry
7015527 we are recovering cctv from the bus station and surrounding area and from the description and images it appears obvious one of the suspects is in his working clothes and is a labourer or manual worker
7015528 no player will be kept here against their will this does not mean that madrid will not defend the interests of the club
7015529 im sure that robinho has already weighed up the consequences of his decision and im sure that in the next few days he will give a letter to the club to announce that he wants to go if he does not want to be here he should leave as soon as possible
7015530 i can tell you that madrid are not going to transfer robinho we are not going to sell him if he wants to go then he should go now telling the press about it is not the right way to do things
7015531 its not necessarily that he will have to pay the 120m he would end his contract but the courts will decide what he has to pay
7015532 nobody is obliged to stay here but we will defend our interests
7015533 this is what we announced publicly on our webpage he should leave as soon as possible but he must accept the consequences of rescinding his contract when it has two years remaining
7015534 i hear that we wants to go well he will have to give notice in writing
7015535 no because the transfers need to be done at the end of the competition not five days before the start of the season
7015536 its a lack of respect to the club its history and to the fans we want robinho to stay in madrid
7015537 right now with this situation we cannot do anything to take a decision like that in life you have to abide by the consequences
7015538 if he says tomorrow that no he doesnt want to go that he was only raising the idea then we can talk
7015539 hmm it looks like you have a lot of punctuation

7015608 one of the most popular digital synths ever was the dx7 from yamaha released in 1983 it featured a whole new type of synthesis called fm frequency modulation it certainly is not analog and it is difficult to program but can result in some excellent sounds it is difficult because it is non analog and thus a whole new set of parameters are available for tweaking many of which seemed counter intuitive and unfamiliar and programming had to be accomplished via membrane buttons one data slider and a small lcd screen still the sounds it shipped with and that many users did manage to create were more complex and unique than anything before it percussive and metallic but thick as analog at times the dx 7 was known for generating unique sounds still popular to this day the dx 7 was also a truly affordable programmable synth when it was first released almost every keyboardist bought one at the time making the dx 7 one of the best selling synths of all time it also came with midi which was brand new at the time sequential had already released the first midi synth the prophet 600 roland wouldnt get around to adding midi for another year with the juno 106 and it would be three years before roland can counter the popularity of the dx7 with a digital synth of their own the d 50 the dx 7 has been used by the crystal method kraftwerk underworld orbital bt talking heads brian eno tony banks mike lindup of level 42 jan hammer roger hodgson teddy riley brian eno t lavitz of the dregs sir george martin supertramp phil collins stevie wonder daryl hall steve winwood scritti politti babyface peter john vettese depeche mode d ream les rhytmes digital front 242 u2 a ha enya the cure astral projection fluke kitaro vangelis elton john james horner toto donald fagen michael mcdonald chick corea level 42 queen yes michael boddicker julian lennon jean michel jarre sneaker pimps lynyrd skynyrd greg phillanganes jerry goldsmith jimmy edgar beastie boys stabbing westward and herbie hancock pretty impressive for just a partial listing
7015609 carl lewis won four events in 1984 but it was not the same impression on us
7015610 it was not with a world record it is the difference
7015611 he is good and great for our sport he can help to build up our sport
7015612 i was a little bit prepared for something around 9 70 in the 100 but this was not expected
7015613 i thought he would make the record but not this time
7015614 he was fantastic we are very privileged to have this
7015615 we have the best cyclists ronaldinho is here in football
7015616 were not saying it should be an entire major league team but we want the top athletes here at the olympics
7015617 that is going to be hard because baseball in the united states is a huge business
7015618 unless they find a way to have a couple week break i dont see them letting their best players leave because you might take two or three players from one club and they might lose a pennant because of it
7015619 it is normal actually for him not to come back
7015620 it is an unfortunate comment at this time especially when we are driving young people to become more involved
7015621 we have to see it in the glory of their moment and give it to them
7015622 we have to allow the personality of youth to express itself
7015623 he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made
7015624 not this time he was fantastic we are very privileged to have this
7015625 it is normal actually for him not to come back
7015626 it is an unfortunate comment at this time especially when we are driving young people to become more involved
7015627 we have to see it in the glory of their moment and give it to them
7015628 we have to allow the personality of youth to express itself
7015629 he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made

7015634 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7015635 complimentary this is an incredible guy cmon hes a phenomenon
7015636 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7015637 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7015638 if she has the ring bring it if not bring the hand ill recognize it
7015639 the operation continues to be a disaster and is getting worse by the day
7015640 however political commercials and films which are dramatized and made to distort issues or create a slanted impression should not be allowed
7015641 my reaction is to re submit my two banned films for reappraisal to test whether the pms pronouncements are for real
7015642 theres lots of skepticism and wait and see attitude judging from the blogs
7015643 his voice was fading after that he didnt say anything else i went there and his shirt was full of blood he was unconscious
7015644 biden has a well deserved reputation of being verbose and gaffe prone
7015645 i was pretty surprised when the police showed up at the door with a warrant
7015646 they said i was under arrest and said they had to handcuff me i told them i didnt think that was necessary but they said it was procedure
7015647 i should have paid the fines i dont know why i didnt
7015648 but i do think the whole handcuffing thing was a little extreme
7015649 there was a car accident reported at the same time i was being arrested and booked
7015650 and the officers who were busy with me couldnt respond
7015651 hopefully we can get these cowards to where they belong behind bars
7015652 to do something like this to an animal especially such an innocent animal is really horrible
7015653 i mean if they took them because they needed them or were going to take care of them then thats one thing but this i cant understand
7015654 the additional loads imposed by wind turbines of any significant size will typically exceed what existing building structures have been designed for
7015655 people were complaining they were too loud when they turned
7015656 windmills are not a solution they are another thing that can help
7015657 they are a part of a package that you should certainly explore and probably implement to free us from dependence on foreign oil and help us keep from polluting the world
7015658 if he wants to run for a third term i think its a great idea
7015659 but that is a decision hell have to make by the way im running for a third term
7015660 hes term limited out as well and we were talking about that
7015661 i said to him the question is if there werent term limits would you seek a third term his answer was he didnt know if he would do that
7015662 the only thing thats appropriate is to go back to the voters
7015663 woe to the people who do it through legislation because the public is strongly in favor of term limits
7015664 if you want to look at a model for how to handle this economy look at new york city
7015665 i cant think of another geographic location that has responded to the economic situation which people could feel coming for two or three years better than new york city
7015666 there are four runs attributed to ryder that are in the wrong place in both the batting section of the score and in the bowling section
7015667 there is no doubt that a recording error of some kind has occurred so where do these runs belong
7015668 it is all about the scoring an activity usually taken for granted
7015669 anybody who knows garrett knew that this was not garrett
7015670 and the medication had to play a part in it because he was so outgoing and had his life planned out everything planned out and this is something that just went wrong real quickly in a matter of hours

7015686 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7015687 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7015688 can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7015689 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7015690 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7015691 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7015692 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
7015693 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7015694 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7015695 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7015696 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community
7015697 looking for the good of making these children accountable its for the concern of these children getting an education

7015712 tapi kemudian muncul nama sugik yang ternyata terlibat karena membantu pembunuhan asrori sebelumnya dalam pemeriksaan kemat dan devid menyembunyikan nama sugik karena alasan tertentu
7015713 lagi pula mayatnya juga sudah dikubur bisa jadi kita disalahkan kalau membongkar lagi

7015738 la situaci n ha mejorado s lo ligeramente tras el repliegue de las principales unidades de rusia ya que las tropas rusas mantienen el control de varios territorios estrat gicos es decir que las fuerzas de ocupaci n contin an sus acciones militares
7015739 el repliegue de las tropas rusas transcurri sin incidentes y concluy como hab a sido planeado a las 19
7015740 las tropas de ocupaci n tambi n abandonaron la localidad de kaspi

7015774 bishop ronald fabbro made comments of a speedy resolution and compassion wheres the compassion we want to move on with our lives and weve got this hanging over us
7015775 bishop fabbro in his homily apologized and said we were going to be dealt with expediently and gently
7015776 that has not happened i believe the majority of the catholic congregation believes weve reached a resolution we havent every time we turn around somebody is preventing us from reaching a resolution
7015777 the courtroom girls have already went through that with the police the crown attorney and now im going through it three or four different times over again
7015778 i know that the diocesan co ordinator for this is aware this is something that is painful for people to have to go through again i know he is working really hard on addressing those concerns to be honest i havent heard of that complaint in a long time
7015779 now theyre putting a new person on that doesnt know whats going on and has to take time to read all our files
7015780 this is going to drag on and on and on
7015781 were just as disappointed as anybody else because we were hoping to move forward and meet the needs of any victims
7015782 its frustrating to these women because they had been promised by the diocese that things would be dealt with expeditiously and youre now looking at years since this process started
7015783 they make it sound like bishop fabbro has to sell his house because he needs the money for sexual abuse victims
7015784 there were a number of factors i hadnt heard of that one before
7015785 the diocese has had various insurance companies over the years that will pay for all most or part of it
7015786 four of our soldiers have been martyred while we killed 35 militants and damaged several of their hideouts
7015787 a lot of people are still under the rubble we have recovered eight bodies
7015788 this function is set out in the joint position of russia and france
7015789 should we sit behind the fence what use would we be then they georgian forces will drive around in hummers move munitions around in trucks and are we supposed to just count them
7015790 at least 70 innocent civilians most of them women and children
7015791 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7015792 we are following the development and if they are looking for a provocation we will know how to avoid it
7015793 i brought the kids so if they the activists arrive i can tell them welcome and thank you for not forgetting us
7015794 nobody thinks that these boats will break the siege in a practical way but this is a moral message what is happening in gaza is illegal and inhumane and must be halted
7015795 this was a particularly horrifying ordeal for a teenage girl and its vital we trace the individuals involved
7015796 the bus station is likely to have been busy at this time of night and i would appeal to anyone who might have seen the two suspects before or after the incident to come forward as they may have important information to this inquiry
7015797 we are recovering cctv from the bus station and surrounding area and from the description and images it appears obvious one of the suspects is in his working clothes and is a labourer or manual worker
7015798 its a common misconception that summer is the time when love blossoms and relationships thrive
7015799 research has shown that there is a greater chance of reviewing your career during summer so it fits that this theory should extend to ones relationships and personal life
7015800 it is easy to be so stressed out and busy during our everyday life at home that we dont have the energy to tackle elements of our life that need to be changed
7015801 holidaymakers may find themselves in their hotel chatting to a stranger at the bar perhaps
7015802 this can be very appealing when they might be otherwise unnecessarily clinging on to a dull and stale relationship back at home
7015803 on the other hand you may be on holiday with your partner and even though your relationship may have been going well back at home you are exposed to their unattractive habits and idiosyncrasies

7015837 without devotion to the blessed sacrament people quickly lose eucharistic faith
7015838 who could claim that he has a right to receive the body of christ this is all an act of gods immeasurable love our lord makes himself available to us in his body and blood for holy communion but we can never say that we have the right to him that we can demand to receive our lord in holy communion each time we approach we should approach with a profound sense of our own unworthiness
7015839 it is the greatest act of charity to prevent somebody from doing something that is sacrilegious that is to warn them and then actually refuse to be party to a sacrilege the church in her love prevents people from doing things that are gravely offensive to god and gravely damaging to their own souls
7015840 we have to be the one to monitor the situation and discipline ourselves not to approach to receive holy communion
7015841 the minister of holy communion has the obligation to refuse holy communion to that person
7015842 an attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil
7015843 people would be led to think it is alright to be in the state of mortal sin and to receive our lord in holy communion
7015844 that the public act which this person is committing which everyone thinks is a serious sin must not be so serious because the church permits that person to receive holy communion
7015845 conscience is not some sort of subjective reality where i make up for myself what is right and good rather it is an objective reality where i conform my own thinking to what is true
7015846 the first thing that needs to be said is that the body and blood of christ is a gift of gods love to us it is the greatest gift a gift beyond our ability to describe
7015847 a gift is freely given out of love and that is what god is doing for us every time we are able to participate in mass and approach to receive holy communion
7015848 the scribes and the pharisees have taken their seat on the chair of moses
7015849 only request in my behalf both inward and outward strength that i may not only speak but truly will and that i may not merely be called a christian but really found to be one for if i be truly found a christian i may also be called one and be deemed faithful
7015850 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7015851 would not try to exercise the sort of medical measures and practices that would be involved in saving that child
7015852 really designed simply to burden the original decision of the woman and the physician to induce labor and perform an abortion
7015853 lets trust the guy who just botched the abortion to determine whether or not he actually did botch the abortion
7015854 was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade
7015855 if your hand or your foot causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away it is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into eternal fire and if your eye causes you to sin tear it out and throw it away it is better for you to enter into life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into fiery gehenna

7015977 i dont know what those people in washington are taking to sleep at night after all their electorally driven accounting and finance exercises but i can tell you what they will be doing to keep the government open for business printing a whole lot of money chairman bernanke has the discount window open to any collateralization not worth the paper it is written on so in effect he has the helicopters ready to drop hundred dollar bills over wall street as he once famously described the ultimate policy instrument of a fiat money system of course if he does that we will have to change his nickname from helicopter ben to hyperinflation ben which answers the question of who picks up the tab of bailing out fannie and freddie anyone owning dollars
7015978 first came bear stearns then mortgage lenders and borrowers followed by fannie mae and freddie mac theyve all looked to uncle sam for a bailout and now the word around washington is that detroit will be next on the taxpayer supplicant list earlier this month the detroit free press reported that the top dogs at ford gm and chrysler had a meeting of the minds and decided that the way out of their current losing streak would be to ask the feds for a lifeline they figure theyll need 40 billion or so to ride out their current troubles until they reach the promised land of hybrids the chevy volt and who knows maybe even profits weve since heard that lobbyists for the car makers are taking their pitch for direct federal loans around washington with a goal of unveiling the plan after labor day conveniently in the frenzy of the fall election campaign theyve briefed congressman john dingell the dean of michigan democrats as well as officials in the bush white house

7015982 it is normal actually for him not to come back
7015983 it is an unfortunate comment at this time especially when we are driving young people to become more involved
7015984 we have to see it in the glory of their moment and give it to them
7015985 we have to allow the personality of youth to express itself
7015986 he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made

7016010 nobody thinks that these boats will break the siege in a practical way but this is a moral message what is happening in gaza is illegal and inhumane and must be halted

7016012 theres no such thing as a post olympic budget for sponsors out there so unless you have endorsements coming into a games the million dollars isnt going to show up
7016013 its not the olympic success that makes or breaks a professional career its something ive worked pretty hard at
7016014 that will probably cover their debt and its certainly not going to put them into the money
7016015 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out

7016023 we think if we educate people and address this people will appreciate that

7016025 the beaches are safe as long as youre aware of the situation
7016026 the parachute payments really go toward the salaries you carry from the premier league the biggest problem is that you come down carrying players who are focused elsewhere
7016027 in their heads they are premier league players even though theyve been relegated and had a below average season and some of them are not wanted by premier league teams
7016028 the club become secondary to their personal ambitions that mentality is difficult to deal with but it happens to every team i had it at west ham and i had it here you lose three or four top players who go back to the premier league
7016029 three or four others feel they should be there you get new players in and you have to mould the team and learn to win the hard part is getting the balance right
7016030 i was very disappointed with myself we had high hopes and its the one real disappointment of my managerial career much more so than the second premier league season at west ham
7016031 this is going to be a difficult year finances are tight but my own ambitions will always be the same to win something major
7016032 hopefully weve picked up another good player that will come in and help the cause
7016033 we are still very much in the hunt for moritz although we have something else going on with regards to bringing in another defender
7016034 moritz still has a hunger and he feels he is a premier league defender so do we but if we could bring him in we would be delighted
7016035 certainly guerra is a very good player and one that im still interested in
7016036 the spanish market is something that should be explored a lot more pablo counago really enjoys playing here ivan campo really enjoys playing in england and having two players of that quality means they can pass on the gospel we have a contact in valencia and we are on building that

7016059 were looking for those who can succeed here from places where they may not have thought about the naval academy
7016060 were going to get people who before went off to princeton and stanford and mit some of those young people are going to come here
7016061 its a little bit of young people who are able to see what they might be doing in the future and their part of protecting america
7016062 but i think with the amount of advertising that the typical high school kid sees the money would be better spent targeting those kids who need only make a very small transition to go into a very competitive situation
7016063 how do we reach out and market the naval academy to a young diverse achieving group who want to as the theme says fulfill their destiny
7016064 is to reach out to those who havent considered the naval academy
7016065 and more what i consider under represented ethnic and racial minorities
7016066 i think its going to take a generation to get an officer corps that will represent america
7016067 my goal is to get moving down that path at the naval academy
7016068 its an important part of getting over the fear of the unknown and the uncertainty of military service
7016069 one thing about surfing its not a very welcoming sport in a lot of ways people jealously guard where there are waves
7016070 theyre all willing to share the excitement and joy people have for surfing and the ocean
7016071 whats unique about this place is that its such a community even among 350 000 people theres still a core
7016072 ive lived in other beach towns but thats the lure back theres definitely a homing beacon in ocean city it brings you back
7016073 a lot of old guys come up here early in the morning we shoot the b s we drink a cup of coffee and then we go surfing if there are waves
7016074 i know everyone up there its one of those social things
7016075 plus he lets us play dominoes on his bench if you cant surf and you can only swim so far
7016076 hes probably one of the best calves ive seen very inquisitive not shy not overly cautious

7016190 we still have to go out there and prove ourselves we didnt do anything last year
7016191 we know what they can do theyre very high level players and should complement the guys that are already here
7016192 yeah it could have been kind of predictable last year
7016193 but hopefully ill get some change ups and weve got some new guys inside that we could definitely do more things with theres more possibilities
7016194 this decisions going to be based on who we feel at this point gives us the best chances to win
7016195 reps are cherished in this league as a quarterback so i mean every single rep whether it be a game or practice i try to make the absolute most out of
7016196 so these reps have been great obviously everybody wants to play so i just try to make the most of every single one
7016197 when that comes ill deal with it thats part of the game too but until then no
7016198 i did have an injury and was out some things happened and competition is a part of this game
7016199 it happens everyday out here with a lot of positions for some reason quarterback is a position in the nfl where it doesnt happen as often especially when you are a high pick
7016200 you can be 14 2 and lose your job you can be 2 14 and lose your job

7016211 today and during this conference we all have to look at the reasons why voters should support us with their votes as ifp in the forthcoming election if we do not provide a compelling answer to that question then we are already doomed
7016212 i know that of all opposition parties that the ifp is the party that operates against most odds
7016213 the point i wish to make upfront is that the availability of these billions could have made a better life for the poorest of the poor were it not for the fact that honesty integrity and courage are rare commodities that are not in abundance amongst us as representatives of the people at all these levels
7016214 it is clear that so far a lot of the money that the fiscus makes available for delivery does not reach the people that we so glibly promise a better life because we have amongst us too many representatives at all levels who lack honesty integrity and courage
7016215 these elections have ceased to be ideological battle grounds ordinary voters are not really clued up as to who bears the label of liberal communist or progressive
7016216 all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france
7016217 they are still in poti and there are no signs of their intention to withdraw from there which is obviously the violation of ceasefire
7016218 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7016219 im just going to say that im happy for nona that the person who did this to her is finally going to be brought to justice
7016220 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee watch the first obama biden rally live at 3pm et on www barackobama com spread the word
7016221 with money being tight its hard paying for school clothes was outrageous and shoes are expensive this helps kids start out on the right foot this is a great organization i dont know what i would do without them
7016222 every year we bring families in and kids receive shoes before school
7016223 theres a huge need for this program its grown every year the first year we gave out 300 pairs of shoes this year over 1 100 pairs of shoes will be put on children
7016224 its great to see the kids get excited they truly appreciate it
7016225 its rewarding to know youre part of something thats so needed and being here to see the kids receive the shoes is even better i like this program because you can go out buy a pair of shoes and feel good knowing theyll be worn by a child who needs them
7016226 the girls and even the boys are particular about what they want out of the boxes
7016227 we try to accommodate them give them a choice and make sure everybody is happy its important for their self esteem
7016228 people come through with every charity and its amazing how giving they are were also thankful for our tons of volunteers
7016229 with the economy the way it is theres such a need for shoes
7016230 i think its important to volunteer my time to help families get the shoes they need
7016231 were still banging out ideas and its something we have to come to a mutual agreement over
7016232 the meeting went on a for a couple of hours and we werent getting anywhere
7016233 were going to meet with them again and try to get something solved
7016234 i believe our main problem is the city the county and the board of directors of the humane society are dealing with very very archaic laws in the ohio revised code
7016235 theres a little bit of hard disagreement a little bit of concern on all parties
7016236 its not strictly money the county has been very generous and we need some adjustments with the county city the humane officer has never asked for a raise and the county has done a good job as far as keeping a person in a quality piece of employment
7016237 before we hire somebody as an employee and then find out you couldve done this and shouldve done it like this we want to make sure we all are pretty much in agreement that this is the structure we want to see in the county
7016238 were excited and thinking we may keep that for next year
7016239 one of the major issues was the parking lot and its done
7016240 it began the week of the fair as far as tearing it down theyll start hauling away debris on monday
7016241 they tore the gym off first and then went straight across the front
7016242 to have him here at the start of the school year to set that up and running that will certainly be beneficial
7016243 it was exciting to be here through all of the construction its exciting and a new challenge
7016244 i sympathize with both families but taking everything into account this was in the best interest of justice
7016245 we have to take everything into consideration when we prosecute someone and the conditions of the roads contributed to this accident it was a terrible terrible accident
7016246 thursday night and friday morning i have given this case very careful consideration
7016247 i believe that we all have a moral compass we have to follow its what makes you tick its what makes you not care about some things or care very deeply for others like your family
7016248 that has a lot to do with why the state is not asking for a bigger sentence
7016249 in some way shape or form you are someone who had a part in this child dying
7016250 but the child was not secured with a safety belt
7016251 mr farley has also been charged with a driving offense his third for that offense
7016252 i will take care of your case and his at the same time
7016253 that gives you an opportunity to think of what to say to him and for him to think about what he wants to say to you
7016254 a loss like that affects you for the rest of your life
7016255 leaving the village without a patrol officer on duty is opening the village up for traffic and criminal violators to run free in the village
7016256 our track is more practical day to day life and politics just screws it up
7016257 i didnt like bushs 2004 opponent john kerry i dont know it was overall everything i couldnt be precise
7016258 ill probably vote for mccain this year i like the military background the experience
7016259 i was a clinton supporter i would have voted for hillary or john edwards
7016260 you know when youre driving down the road and you see a turtle on a fence post
7016261 well you know that turtle didnt get up there by himself someones got to have put him up there and if theres one thing you know its sooner or later that turtles going to fall
7016262 what im feeling is people are starting to lean toward obama that those who may have had some prejudices may have put those aside for the good of the country
7016263 appalachians are one of the groups of people who will vote for principle and not the pocketbook
7016264 patriotism is never far from the top of the list among my people sacrifice for country duty honor that sort of stuff is huge
7016265 i just think it should be over its dragging out too long
7016266 they reject the notion that one party has a corner on all the good ideas
7016267 all he needs to do is talk about the times hes worked with democrats he needs to talk about the times hes disagreed with the president and he needs to point out that barack obama was rated most liberal of the delegation
7016268 it becomes a win win situation for the children and family members of these offenders when they are able to maintain employment and provide monetary support to the family
7016269 di sini kafir di sana kafir di mana mana ada kafir

7016273 all of us who broke down barriers faced a lot of resistance but now hes trying to break down the biggest barrier of all ive got to tell you when youre in the middle of that its a very scary feeling
7016274 and everybody told me that a black player couldnt do that

7016299 i dont think i could have come up with the characters on my own theyre bizarre idiosyncratic so they are based on some real experiences but of course there are embellishments
7016300 john mccains newfound concern for those without healthcare would be touching if he werent pushing a plan that would leave millions without insurance and raise taxes on benefits for the first time
7016301 but when a man loses track of the number of houses he owns its not surprising that hes lost touch with those who fear losing their health coverage
7016302 presidential races are close and we expect this one to be no different
7016303 but they should figure out how to spin the fact that john mccain owns a dozen houses and thinks the fundamentals of our economy are strong before trying to spin our convention
7016304 yes john mccain whats that you say hmmm thats exactly what id expect from someone who doesnt remember how many houses he owns a guy like that wouldnt know what real people are going through with foreclosure threats to their own houses the burden of health care costs and the lousy bush economy

7016309 in the second or third inning i told the guys tonight was the epitome of being effectively wild
7016310 i was getting away with some stuff i was missing my spots
7016311 one thing i talked about before the game is we cant do two things walk people and commit errors because of their propensity to hit home runs
7016312 we got away with it tonight but you cant expect to do that all the time we were fortunate

7016318 compound that with this being the olympics and its the best riders in the world all trying to be their best for today it was a tough course it was hot a lot of little things led to my result
7016319 im pretty disappointed i was hoping to have a good race and i didnt but im still pumped to be here and pumped to be part of the olympics
7016320 thats saying something when youve been racing for 10 years
7016321 i felt like i was up there with the pace there werent a lot of gaps then on the third lap it just suddenly hit me the heat then i hit grovel town on lap 4
7016322 its upper body fatiguing as well because youre pulling so much
7016323 on the two longer climbs the heat is beating down on you and all you can pretty much think about is how hot it was

7016358 theres one thing i hate about this sport is that the judges can control peoples lives and can take points away and they can do whatever they want

7016369 we need our heroes and heroines such as raymond mhlaba because they help us to define a national identity that affirms our humanity and our human dignity
7016370 informed by the concept and practice of national reconciliation we are at work to achieve national and social cohesion and the birth of a new south african national identity with all of our citizens inspired by a new patriotism

7016376 hes a genuinely enthusiastic traveler with his feet on the ground
7016377 i realized how much was revealed everything is revealed its political realities economic realities its human condition how i felt about a place in the past and how i feel now
7016378 with that trip i felt such a continuous sense of discovery self discovery and discovery i thought maybe the ultimate in this would be to take the same trip again a trip that had meant a lot to me in 1973

7016389 aunque mandan un mensaje negativo de que este negocio no va a funcionar deben estar trabajando internamente para que las otras editoriales no se adelanten
7016390 se ahorran costes de impresi n y distribuci n riesgos que en el modelo tradicional asume el editor
7016391 no s si el libro en formato papel va a desaparecer pero desde el punto de vista del negocio perder importancia
7016392 it has been an amazing journey for me this past week i have been training so hard because to come back after the synchro i really wanted to put in a good performance
7016393 im going into the final now to enjoy myself and get the whole experience of what an olympic final is going to be like because in london 2012 that is what i am aiming for
7016394 to go into the olympic final in london i just need that experience from beijing
7016395 it just didnt go my way i dived well yesterday and i knew it was going to be a bit more of a struggle this morning but i didnt think it was going to be like that
7016396 its gonna be an awesome party with more than 7 things i like
7016397 its gonna be totally awesome i hope its a great time
7016398 this name obviously links to big brother kingstons and is another nod to jamaica and reggae
7016399 he is pleased to be back in this country because for the first time he can appear before a court of justice
7016400 he tells me that his trial in vietnam a country which has been condemned by virtually every organisation concerned with justice and human rights was a charade was a travesty of justice
7016401 mr gadd has demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
7016402 unfortunately the court didnt agree with my submission that it should hear me on the issue about the unfairness of how he has been treated by the vietnamese system
7016403 that was an opportunity that i sought to take on his behalf but the court decided it did not want to hear
7016404 therefore this morning there has been no opportunity before an impartial tribunal to put forward why it was he was innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted in vietnam there may be another opportunity in the future its too early to tell
7016405 mr gadd wants me to say to you that he did not commit the offences for which he was convicted it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his defence forward
7016406 ultimately he wants that to be tested if he can before the courts of this country
7016407 mr gadd now has three days to work with the police its a completely harmonious relationship between him and the police
7016408 mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety
7016409 mi vida privada la resuelvo yo y no me la tiene que resolver ningun gremio

7016420 this minute i am ok this minute i am ok
7016421 you mentioned maaleh adumim is that a nice place to live
7016422 im a tourist i live in brooklyn and i really want to live here but my husband doesnt
7016423 everyone here is so gorgeous so beautiful like models everyone can be models here look at this one
7016424 back home the people are so different its not the same theyre so materialistic there its all about how much you make the money here everything seems so relaxed so much more spiritual jerusalem is also the intellectual capital of the world i would never say anything bad about this country like the spies did during the time of moses if its terribly hot i just go with it i tell myself its ok i wont ever say anything bad
7016425 its like the whole world seems compacted into this country youve got a little bit of everything here
7016426 in 1989 when i came for a visit i said everything you just said to me now i cried and begged every beggar i gave money to in jerusalem to please pray for me so that one day i might have the privilege of living here and you know something it worked my husband who didnt want to go at first finally relented
7016427 there have never been more registrations handled in one day during the ordinary course of businesses by any registrar in history
7016428 it was an easy decision for us to offer unlimited email storage
7016429 it gives our customers the peace of mind they will always have space for incoming emails this is about giving our customers what they want and thats what go daddy is all about
7016430 descobrirmos que o sentimento de felicidade e otimismo tem um efeito de prote o
7016431 i am looking forward to my debut hopefully the clubs will reach an agreement
7016432 i have dreamed about this moment of joining a premier league club this is the best league in the world
7016433 no disrespect to the russian league but all the best players play their football here
7016434 i hope the two clubs can agree i love the premier league and though the russians gave me a chance to be in europe hopefully they will reach an agreement
7016435 everybody has their price it doesnt matter who it is weve got to be realistic enough to know that
7016436 however it would take a hell of an offer at the moment to even tempt us because were into the season
7016437 there are 10 days to go until the transfer window closes and we would struggle to get any replacement
7016438 so the message is hands off unless youve got a real lot of money
7016439 i believe that emmanuel has been unfairly treated because he had a lot of interest from many big clubs and he always told me one to one his preference was to stay in the end he stayed
7016440 that story did not come out like that in the press and unfortunately he is paying a price for a story which is not really him
7016441 he made a press conference in austria where people interpreted his statements a bit differently but i know what he told me and i know he made sacrifices to stay
7016442 i was convinced he wanted to stay but i was not always convinced he would stay because there is a big difference in that
7016443 people have advisors and some clubs pay higher wages than we do we have to accept that
7016444 each night god cleans up the mess the argentines make by day
7016445 no player will be kept here against their will this does not mean that madrid will not defend the interests of the club
7016446 im sure that robinho has already weighed up the consequences of his decision and im sure that in the next few days he will give a letter to the club to announce that he wants to go if he does not want to be here he should leave as soon as possible
7016447 i can tell you that madrid are not going to transfer robinho we are not going to sell him if he wants to go then he should go now telling the press about it is not the right way to do things
7016448 its not necessarily that he will have to pay the 120million he would end his contract but the courts will decide what he has to pay
7016449 nobody is obliged to stay here but we will defend our interests
7016450 this is what we announced publicly on our webpage he should leave as soon as possible but he must accept the consequences of rescinding his contract when it has two years remaining
7016451 i hear that we wants to go well he will have to give notice in writing
7016452 no because the transfers need to be done at the end of the competition not five days before the start of the season
7016453 its a lack of respect to the club its history and to the fans we want robinho to stay in madrid
7016454 right now with this situation we cannot do anything to take a decision like that in life you have to abide by the consequences
7016455 if he says tomorrow that no he doesnt want to go that he was only raising the idea then we can talk
7016456 madrid respect his decision and nobody can work where they dont want to
7016457 the thing about ledley is that he has a particular way of preparing for games we look after him in a certain way physically and we have to take it on a match by match basis as to whether he is going to feature depending on how he feels physically
7016458 he has trained well on wednesday and thursday without any negative reaction and well see how that impacts ahead of saturdays game against sunderland
7016459 his knee is not something you can predict a month ahead or a season ahead it is something we need to look at short term
7016460 ledley is the type of player who would walk into any side he is a top notch player hes got great qualities and when he is fit he plays when we can play him we line him up
7016461 hes a player who unfortunately throughout his career has had injury problems its a tragedy really
7016462 football is like that there are footballers who suffer injuries and the game is so demanding physically today that you cant possibly put players in your side unless they are 100 per cent fit or very close to it that has sometimes been the case with ledley unfortunately
7016463 he is a key player on the field but off the field he is a character as well and important as a leader in the group
7016464 so we have to do as much as we can to make sure he is fit but we also have to keep a close eye on how his injury is progressing it is important we dont take any risks at all with his fitness in putting him in when he isnt right
7016465 i never played against roy in his playing career but i am aware of what he achieved in his career playing at a high level all the time
7016466 adapting video content for mobiles has traditionally been difficult due to wide variations in device capabilities
7016467 we are constantly working to improve the experience of developing mobile web video broadcasting and advertising which is often made difficult by the variety and capabilities of devices
7016468 in working with dotmobi we are able to provide deviceatlas users with information for creating rich mobile content for nearly every video capable device on the planet
7016469 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del

7016471 las fuerzas georgianas patrullan en hummers veh culos todoterreno acorazados transportan municiones en camiones se supone que tenemos que limitarnos a contarlos
7016472 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7016473 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7016474 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
7016475 this shows that organisations still focus too intensely on business and it and not on informing and enabling business strategy which is the ultimate value and purpose of enterprise architecture
7016476 this was reinforced several times during the conference where we asked delegates to answer a set of questions which would provide a snapshot of the enterprise architecture market in sa
7016477 the chief strategy officer cso should clearly have responsibility and final answerability for enterprise architecture
7016478 as long as the majority of enterprise architecture functions still reside in the it camp its overall value and purpose will not be delivered
7016479 certification is becoming a key requirement for anyone wanting a career in enterprise architecture
7016480 esperamos no estar aqu en la reuni n con spanair porque esperamos que nos entreguen los cad veres a lo largo del d a aunque si no es as iremos finalmente
7016481 no va a servir para nada porque no est en condiciones de explicar las causas del accidente
7016482 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7016483 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7016484 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7016485 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7016486 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7016487 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7016488 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7016489 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

7016491 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7016492 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas

7016494 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7016495 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7016496 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7016497 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7016498 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7016499 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7016500 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7016501 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7016502 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7016503 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7016504 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7016505 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7016506 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7016507 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7016508 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7016509 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7016510 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

7016513 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7016514 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7016515 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7016516 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7016517 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7016518 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7016519 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7016520 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7016521 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7016522 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7016523 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7016524 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7016525 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7016526 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7016527 my best moment i have a lot of good moments but the one i prefer is when i kicked the hooligan
7016528 i didnt study i live you cant study these things life teaches them to you you dont find them in a book ive read a lot of socrates on page 3 of the sun
7016529 football is like making love if you cant last 90 minutes like me you wont win
7016530 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7016531 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7016532 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7016533 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7016534 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7016535 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7016536 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7016537 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7016538 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7016539 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7016540 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7016541 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7016542 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7016543 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7016544 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7016545 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7016546 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7016547 i kept us in the game we were never out of it
7016548 we got the at bats we needed in the end
7016549 to hold them to four runs the way i pitched the last two times against them this was pretty good

7016552 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7016553 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional

7016555 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7016556 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7016557 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7016558 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7016559 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista

7016561 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7016562 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7016563 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7016564 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7016565 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7016566 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7016567 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7016568 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

7016573 the west had engineered the impasse in the talks so that their preferred leader takes over
7016574 i get tired of the zanu pf ites blaming their flagging political support on the west when will they be men and acknowledge their own failings let them demonstrate what powers they have ceded to the prime minister or to the other party
7016575 identify those areas and you will see who is the stumbling block
7016576 we are together in this struggle we can never be in bed with zanu pf at the expense of our colleagues whom we identify with
7016577 the purpose of the poster is to get students to see something they havent seen before

7016581 you cant portray jesus like that he believes in matrimony that relationships like that should be done inside matrimony

7016583 we had an unnecessary rough time getting started as a club it took us a half an hour just to get 10 signatures from students on campus to just get the process started the closed mindedness that we encountered was disturbing it truly brought shame to this college campus
7016584 of course not closed minded people tend to view atheists as having horns and carrying tridents it is ludicrous yes but many people care not to educate themselves on the thoughts and views of other people we are here to change that its time people learned to grow up

7016595 ich sehe das wort r ckzug nicht gleichbedeutend mit dem wort lebewohl an sondern mit einem schritt in eine andere funktion
7016596 when i first got the armband i was concentrating on promotion now were here and it was great to lead the side out last weekend against arsenal at the emirates
7016597 now it will be great to lead them out for the first home game against everton and i cant wait we will try to play good attacking free flowing football if we can do that in most games we can beat anybody so we need to be on top of our game
7016598 we have been training hard all week and looking good confidence is high after the performance against arsenal we didnt embarrass ourselves so we need to take that into todays game and show people what were good at
7016599 its always nice to get the first game out of the way we knew it would be a good test but i thought that in the end we did quite well after the first 10 minutes
7016600 we got back into the game and in the end could probably have sneaked a draw they caught us by surprise with their speed of play but once we got to grips with it we did really well and showed good character
7016601 in the second half we did really well paul robinson had a chance cleared off the line roman bednar went on and caused all sorts of problems as well
7016602 it will be sad day but i feel it is the right time
7016603 there are a number of factors such as it is becoming increasingly expensive and legal issues such as risk assessments that need to be complied with but mainly i want to focus on other things

7016608 ngapain lo balik lagi pake bawa nama allah segala udahlah di sini cuman ada ssj kamu ke sini sebenarnya kan cuma cari aku dan cari kesalahan kesalahan toh bukan niat mencari allah kalau urusan sama allah langsung aja wong allah itu lebih dekat dari urat leher nggak harus kesini di kerajaan juga bisa di rumah bisa di manapun bisa kenapa sih panggil panggil allah kok harus nunggu restu ya tidaknya saya emangnya saya ini atasan allah apa sih pengaruhku emangnya aku ini pembesar yang setiap ngomong diamieni umat wong saya ini cuman solitaire sebatang kara fakir fana gitu sebenarnya kamu sendiri kan juga bisa apalagi di tempatmu juga ada sahabat dan guruku para wali songo mereka adalah orang yang siap mengajarimu bagaimana cara terbaik berhubungan dengan tuhan dan berakhlak lembut kepada sesama manusia
7016609 begini lho dik siti kita ini kan intinya mendidik umat dari menyembah benda mati atau paham materi seperti patung dan sejenisnya untuk diteruskan tanpa perantara ini itu menjadi langsung menyembah mengagungkan yang maha hidup allah
7016610 lha iya toh dinda kan udah benar mengajari begitu adapun dinda sering memakai jargon manunggaling kawula gusti itu tak lebih untuk melepas kerak pemahaman mereka yang sangat berkarat tentang anggapan bahwa untuk menghadap tuhan harus pakai wasilah rumus materi makelar berhala atau rabi pendeta beserta segala fatwanya hal itu kan dilarang dalam kitab suci wajar dong kalau dinda pakai kata kata ekstrim semacam itu sebagai shock therapi sebab mereka sudah kadung turun temurun meyakini feodalisme ketuhanan yang berlapis lapis seperti agama agama terdahulu biar bisa patas gitu lho
7016611 masalahnya bukan itu dik tetapi orang yang mengaji di tempat sampeyan dan di tempat para wali ternyata saling berseberangan jangan sampai mereka mengatasnamakan diri kita dan agama untuk berebut urusan pamor dunia walaupun sesungguhnya saat ini aroma itu sudah sangat terasa
7016612 bagaimanapun demi syiarnya agama tauhid yang lagi merekah indah dalam kasus ini mau tak mau harus ada yang dikorbankan dan tentunya bukan mengorbankan umat
7016613 berarti salah satu dari pemimpin mereka harus ada yang dikorbankan entah yang di pihakku atau di pihak wali songo
7016614 duduk permasalahannya begini mohon diingat sekali lagi ini demi syiar ini demi umat
7016615 baiklah kalau begitu demi syiar yang lebih luas dan damai ane siap meninggalkan dunia ini mati sajroning urip sudah kujalani sekarang urip sajroning mati adalah ajaran para sahabat dan guruku wali songo yang harus ku tempuh saat ini aku tak mau tanah yang sedang kuajari bertauhid bersama wali songo kembali menjadi tanah yang rumit dalam bertuhan dan kembali menuhankan hukum materi dengan segala rumusan dewa yang begitu banyak dan ribet aku juga tak mau mengorbankan umat sebab aku bukan tipe pemimpin yang bermakmur sentosa di atas penderitaan umat maka hari ini saksikanlah aku syekh siti jenar alias syekh lemah abang alias syekh tanah merah yang bermakna seorang ahli yang telah menguasai tanah yang merah membara penuh prahara seorang yang telah mampu menundukkan segala merahnya nafsu yang muncul dari segala keindahan perut bumi aku akan kembali kepada tuhanku dalam keadaan rela
7016616 untuk itu memang seharusnya kita membiasakan menempatkan derajat penghormatan kepada ulama lebih tinggi dari umara walaupun di tataran praktis harus tetap patuh pada umara semua itu harus dilakukan semata mata agar kehidupan tidak kacau karena ulama lah pemegang rahasia hidup

7016625 a compartir con otros este tesoro pues no hay riqueza mayor que gozar de la amistad de cristo y caminar a su lado merece la pena consagrar a esta hermosa labor nuestras mejores energ as sabiendo que la gracia divina nos precede sostiene y acompa a en su realizaci n
7016626 que se despierte en cada bautizado el misionero que lleva dentro de s y se venza la vacilaci n o la mediocridad que a menudo nos asalta los invito a no dejarse vencer por el miedo abatir por el des nimo o arrastrar por la inercia

7016663 the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
7016664 oncology nurses are on the front lines providing education and support to help patients manage cancer diagnoses and treatment
7016665 this survey shows that as oncology nurses we need to adopt a zero tolerance policy to manage the nausea and vomiting that affect our patients lives
7016666 communication is the most important factor when dealing with the side effects of chemotherapy its critical to let your health care team know what side effects youre having and whether or not the treatments youre on are working
7016667 many factors can contribute to feeling nauseous and sick during chemo so maintaining an ongoing dialogue with your doctor or nurse can really help
7016668 so its really important that before they go into this exciting period in life that they do a little bit of homework
7016669 the key to doing this and take charge of the finances for the first time are quite simple
7016670 firstly establishing some financial goals secondly setting a budget and sticking to it and thirdly making sure that they make the most of what they have making the most of the money they have by minimizing expenses wherever they can
7016671 once theyve established what they actually want to do then the key is to set a budget and to stick to it
7016672 the key to making a budget work is actually tracking your spending to make sure youre meeting your goals
7016673 it comes back to the basic do to track your spending make sure that you know what youre spending your money on where youre spending it and track what your outflows are every month and make sure that youre meeting your goals
7016674 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7016675 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7016676 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7016677 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7016678 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7016679 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7016680 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7016681 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7016682 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7016683 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7016684 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7016685 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7016686 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7016687 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7016688 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7016689 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7016690 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7016691 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7016692 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7016693 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7016694 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7016695 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7016696 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7016697 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7016698 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7016699 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7016700 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7016701 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7016702 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7016703 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7016704 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7016705 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7016706 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7016707 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7016708 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7016709 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7016710 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7016711 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7016712 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7016713 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7016714 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7016715 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7016716 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7016717 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7016718 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7016719 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7016720 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7016721 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7016722 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7016723 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7016724 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7016725 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7016726 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7016727 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7016728 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7016729 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7016730 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7016731 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7016732 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7016733 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7016734 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7016735 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7016736 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7016737 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7016738 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7016739 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7016740 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7016741 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7016742 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7016743 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7016744 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7016745 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7016746 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7016747 nous suivons les instructions formul es par les responsables politiques occidentaux et sommes une fois encore oblig s de rappeler la position russe toutes les actions des forces de maintien de la paix respectent les six principes sign s par les pr sidents russe et fran ais

7016752 senator mccain if you are reading this then you are already dead unless of course you cant or dont breathe
7016753 a death threat is not a legitimate form of political expression
7016754 we wont stand for threats of this kind in colorado
7016755 if we dont receive sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal theres really little option for us than to no bid in this competition
7016756 we think we can meet these requirements if given the time to put together a proposal
7016757 fay will be near or over the gulf coast of the western florida panhandle today and tonight and near or over the gulf coast of mississippi and alabama on sunday
7016758 fay is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches across the western portion of the northern florida peninsula the florida panhandle southwestern georgia and the southern half of both mississippi and alabama with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches possible
7016759 regardless of its exact track fay will be moving rather slowly during the next several days posing a significant heavy rainfall and flood hazard to a very large area
7016760 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7016761 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7016762 j t osullivan will be our starting quarterback going into the season and im expecting him to succeed

7016765 this has been a case of j t performing very well thats why we are where we are j t has very good command of the offense hes played well in all three preseason games and now its time for us to get ready for the regular season
7016766 we want to play our best players that give us the best chance to win
7016767 for our football teams sake its time to get ready for our opening game this decision puts more focus on where it should be now
7016768 the second one is the end of all military actions the commander in chief of the russian federation has taken a decision to that effect and all military activities have been stopped
7016769 only peacekeeping actions are still being executed by a special contingent
7016770 i first heard of this award not as a writer but as a reader where i found it set like a seal on everything i most admired in biography
7016771 i really want us to get away for a night
7016772 come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty
7016773 chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light
7016774 and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying every man of the children of israel shall pitch by his own standard with the ensign of their fathers house far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch
7016775 so they pitched by their standards and so they set forward every one after their families according to the house of their fathers
7016776 and they first took their journey according to the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses in the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of judah according to their armies
7016777 when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him
7016778 the word that the lord spake against babylon and against the land of the chaldeans by jeremiah the prophet declare ye among the nations and publish and set up a standard publish and conceal not say babylon is taken bel is confounded merodach is broken in pieces her idols are confounded her images are broken in pieces

7016820 die heimat hat sich sch n gemacht und tau liegt ihr im haar
7016821 opah masih ingat lagi ketika berusia sembilan tahun opah sering membantu nenek menumbuk jamu
7016822 terdapat hampir 25 campuran herba dan rempah ratus yang opah gunakan untuk penyediaan jamu tradisi ini antaranya ialah serapat biji kani lada putar lada hitam lada ekor kulit kayu manis dan banyak lagi
7016823 kesemua herba tersebut opah peroleh daripada orang kampung opah di perak
7016824 jamu yang dihasilkan ini memang opah tumbuk sendiri dengan cara sedemikian keaslian sesuatu jamu dapat dikekalkan biasanya proses penyediaan jamu opah akan mengambil masa seminggu lebih
7016825 apabila campuran herba dan rempah ratus ini benar benar kering barulah opah akan menggorengnya di dalam kuali tanpa minyak atau orang tua tua panggil goreng sangan setelah itu barulah ia ditumbuk sehingga lumat dan sebati sebelum dibiarkan kering sehari semalam
7016826 proses terakhir yang dilakukan ialah mengayak jamu yang telah ditumbuk hancur dan dimasukkan ke dalam botol atau dijadikan pil
7016827 urutan sebenarnya bertujuan untuk melancarkan perjalanan darah mempercepatkan proses pemulihan tenaga mengurangkan keletihan memecahkan lemak di badan menaikkan seri muka serta memulihkan pusingan haid yang betul
7016828 urutan untuk wanita selepas bersalin pula dapat memulihkan sakit urat kesakitan pada otot dan sendi badan di samping memulihkan fungsi peranakan wanita membuang angin meroyan dan sakit kepala
7016829 mereka bukan tidak boleh menjalani urutan tetapi perlu memastikan masa yang sesuai iaitu selepas luka pembedahan sembuh sepenuhnya namun jika urutan tersebut tidak menyentuh langsung bahagian abdomen atau perut ia dibenarkan untuk mengurangkan rasa letih wanita yang bersalin
7016830 dalam perubatan sains sukan jika seseorang terseliuh di mana mana bahagian tubuh perkara pertama yang perlu dilakukan ialah mengawal kesakitan yang dialami atau dalam erti kata lain mengurangkan bengkak dari aspek fisioterapi
7016831 contohnya jika buku lali kelihatan bengkak ia menandakan bahawa tisu lembut dalam otot atau kapilari darah kita cedera ia mungkin disebabkan hentakan atau koyakan pada bahagian tersebut dalam kes sebegini jika pesakit terus dibawa berurut ia akan menambah kecederaan sedia ada
7016832 memang opah akui perubatan moden juga memainkan peranan penting tetapi rawatan secara tradisional tidak kurang hebatnya asalkan tukang urut tersebut merupakan seorang yang pakar dan mahir dalam teknik mengurut
7016833 kami khawatir dengan serangan panas dan masalah lain yang bisa dialami para pemain dalam cuaca seperti ini
7016834 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7016835 the ministry said it would be one of the highest civilian deaths tolls in the battle against the taliban since they were ousted from power during the 2001 us led invasion
7016836 i think i must make it clear we want to play total rugby an expansive game we want to throw the ball but you cant play a game like that if you dont dominate your first phase
7016837 if you look at our starter moves the way we are managing to break the line and get around our opponents it is all coming into place from there it comes down to the decision making of the players
7016838 so if we turn back now it will mean that we dont trust ourselves i know and i believe that at the end of the day this will be a kind of playing style that the world will fear we have the bulk we have the speed we have everything we just need to put it together
7016839 the aussies have a very good defence so we will have to be on top of our game to be able to do that score four tries but we are certainly going out there with that intent well let the game unfold and we wont be too hasty in going for those tries
7016840 looking at the stats at the breakdown for the tri nations we are struggling a bit but it is a common trend
7016841 the australians turned the all blacks over 11 times at the breakdown in the last test match its an average of 15 to 17 percent in turnovers nevertheless i still back our players and back our ability
7016842 we are the only ones who can rectify our mistakes and we believe we will do that this weekend
7016843 the situation was compromised by our own officials female offenders are supposed to be guarded by female officials
7016844 its happening especially at the nigerian repair shops at very low prices
7016845 i advise all my clients who had their cellphones stolen to greylist their phones instead of blacklisting it as this could help us locate the stolen phone
7016846 they duplicate the cellphones imei number with cellphones that could be in for repairs
7016847 say you send your water damaged phone to a repair shop where duplication takes place the repairmen or women could easily duplicate the legal phones number on to the stolen phone by using specialised software
7016848 two people one armed went into the shop and seized several items another group blew up the atm on the premises while the rest were placed at certain spots surrounding the garage
7016849 they were armed with rifles including ak 47s when the police arrived they were ambushed
7016850 the offence was very well planned the bombing of atms in gauteng has become a national crisis so it was made our mandate to investigate and solve these crimes
7016851 they are famous pups somebody who loves animals should take care of them
7016852 hand this man over to satan so that the sinful nature a may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the lord
7016853 endure hardship as discipline god is treating you as sons for what son is not disciplined by his father
7016854 our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best but god disciplines us for our good that we may share in his holiness
7016855 he who spares his rod of discipline hates his son but he who loves him disciplines diligently and punishes him early
7016856 to keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations there was given me a thorn in my flesh a messenger of satan to torment me
7016857 what theyre all cashew butter and brown rice what could be better
7016858 we have to eat them in order to protect the breed
7016859 a causa della lentezza dei relativi procedimenti amministrativi non sono mai stati destinati ad alcun ente e risultano pertanto inutilizzati
7016860 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7016861 i wouldnt put money on it but there are a lot of other seats that are vulnerable in north carolina liddy dole robin hayes the governors race it may not be that the president brings votes down but people may already be thinking democratic
7016862 the fact he was running against obama in the primaries might make for some footage for the republicans
7016863 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7016864 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president

7016867 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7016868 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7016869 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7016870 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7016871 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7016872 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7016873 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7016874 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7016875 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7016876 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7016877 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7016878 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7016879 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7016880 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7016881 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7016882 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7016883 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7016884 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7016885 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7016886 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7016887 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7016888 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7016889 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7016890 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7016891 los hoteles de valencia y su rea metropolitana cuentan con plena ocupaci n durante el fin de semana

7016893 significan m s de siete puntos por encima de la media de ocupaci n en fines de semana de agosto 2007
7016894 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7016895 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7016896 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7016897 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7016898 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7016899 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7016900 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7016901 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7016902 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7016903 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7016904 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7016905 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7016906 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7016907 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7016908 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7016909 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7016910 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7016911 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7016912 its clear that despite the worries about the credit crunch and other economic difficulties many people have decided that they simply want to get away from the clouds and rain which have plagued the uk this summer
7016913 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7016914 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7016915 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7016916 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7016917 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7016918 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7016919 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7016920 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7016921 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7016922 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7016923 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7016924 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7016925 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7016926 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7016927 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7016928 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7016929 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7016930 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7016931 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7016932 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7016933 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7016934 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7016935 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7016936 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7016937 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7016938 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7016939 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it

7016946 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7016947 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7016948 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7016949 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7016950 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7016951 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7016952 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7016953 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7016954 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7016955 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7016956 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7016957 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7016958 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7016959 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7016960 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7016961 unless masaba repents within four days and take only four wives from the herd he remains condemned to death according to sharia law
7016962 any muslim who married more than the approved number of wives at a time either by mistake or out of ignorance is instructed to choose but only four and ask for allahs forgiveness
7016963 sommige wit mense wil h die w reldbeker sokkertoernooi in 2010 moet misluk
7016964 ek hou by wat ek ges het daar s sommige wit mense wat ni wil h die w reldbeker moet slaag nie omdat hulle nie die demokratiese bestel aanvaar nie gaan kyk maar net na sommige webtuistes en wat daar geskryf staan

7017018 vale mi dai quel giornale che sono 40 minuti che lo stai leggendo
7017019 he really didnt write so much to publish he wrote because he needed to and he had a lot to say
7017020 i think pat protested war in general and he protested inhumane treatment of anybody at any time
7017021 he was really not a troublemaker pat was gracious always he never really intended to be a troublemaker he was just a good honest man
7017022 he was a wonderful teacher he was an ally in the anti war movement i appreciate him for that
7017023 we learned at our expense not at the customers expense
7017024 ive repaired hundreds thousands of chairs over the years it was never routine
7017025 we did whatever we needed to do to keep things going
7017026 i just feel like i had so much more to learn from pat
7017027 when i got out of coaching at georgetown college my business plan was to develop my own office in georgetown to provide first class financial service
7017028 theres been an opportunity presented to me that would allow me to do that which i need to concentrate on
7017029 thats not whats best for my family thats a family decision
7017030 it came down to an opportunity financially that i need to take advantage of
7017031 i just would be relieved if my opponent was to drop out
7017032 that would change my plans for the fall and would allow me to focus more on the legislative process
7017033 it is hard for a 32 year old with a 20 month old son and wife who is a teacher to do both
7017034 today after 10 15 days things are returning to normal shopkeepers have opened their shops and are cleaning the shops if gods will be things would be normal now
7017035 with record crude prices and energy independence on the line the lucky buyer can expect tremendous return on investment for decades to come
7017036 ive heard estimates everywhere from 5 million to 6 million to the skys the limit
7017037 thats not an easy thing to get in the united states these days
7017038 there were some cash flow problems that created a bottleneck in paying crude suppliers
7017039 whoever is there were going to tell them we have some incentives if they put it back in operation
7017040 its really weeded out the little guy thats building on a limited budget
7017041 hes not going to be able to afford to stay in the sport
7017042 unfortunately we lost a great composer a great singer but his works will exist forever it is not a huge lifes work but it is difficult to find a weak song by dorival caymmi
7017043 we are very disappointed because we hear in america that china has religious freedom that china is free you can believe whatever you want theres no persecution and this is not the truth because they took the bibles away from us we feel like its very sad because truth is very important if they lie to us in american and tell us that china is free but then they take the bibles away from us it shows to us its not free
7017044 we care about the people of china we pray for the country of china we want to help and thats why we came with bible to help the people we are not coming here to cause trouble
7017045 we wanted to make it much more enjoyable and fun loving for people we thought that when they come here they should enjoy and have a good experience we wanted to give them a lively experience and through fish pedicure we have been able to give them that
7017046 initially its a bit scary for me it was because i was shivering and all but otherwise once you get doing it you try its okay its a sudden feeling and its really very funny its a very nice feeling
7017047 the biggest worries schools have are hackers getting into the web site
7017048 obviously being interested in computers i asked the student what he was working on the kid replied that he was hacking into the finance office computer so he could mark his tuition account as paid
7017049 its a nightmare the new web 2 0 apps are giving students more ways to get in
7017050 part of the challenge is that the kids in one school will take down the networks of other schools its like having a snow day to them schools have become so dependent on technology to run the office and deliver instruction in the classroom taking down the networks is equivalent to removing the cash registers from wal marts without the technology people cant function
7017051 these include the introduction of malware the need for effective gateway controls and bandwidth consumption we are seeing a significant increase in web 2 0 coming into the schools these new uses are straining all hardware with bottlenecks the peaks in demand raise concerns that school networks cannot handle the traffic schools have to re evaluate their networks
7017052 all of this we didnt traditionally let them do because of security and bandwidth concerns
7017053 weve had to relax our posture to let them all have access this presents us with an interesting challenge i cant say no anymore
7017054 at this point the sense we get from school it administrators is they are constantly fighting bandwidth
7017055 the growing issue is what should it managers do with smartphone and related devices
7017056 when these devices are used it doesnt know it is happening it presents new issues to us these devices can be lost and other users have more readily available access the smartphone has become a us 79 laptop
7017057 we need to push teachers to use educationally sound web sites rather than blogging sites
7017058 it is very difficult to separate the good from the bad on these popular general use web sites
7017059 teachers dont realize that ultimately the school district is responsible for any abuses that occur teachers have to share that responsibility for what their students access in school
7017060 schools have to be current with their use of security technology one of the biggest mistakes it people at schools make is putting all their security on the perimeter over the last few years we are seeing spikes inside the networks now it has to harden the network data center even from its own users
7017061 after consultations with legal advisers and close political supporters and on their advice im taking the decision of resigning from my office
7017062 i see that the biggest hurdle in the way of democracy has been removed and i am sure we can get on with solving all the issues of our country
7017063 the country is now faced with grave challenges the coalition government should not get the impression that now that musharraf has gone all problems are solved there are too many problems

7017097 it is the first time in europe since the cold war that a foreign army has entered the territory of a sovereign state without any internationally accepted legal basis if we were to be ambivalent about this it would give tacit approval to put our country and our citizens under threat

7017111 mark viduka will probably be a couple of weeks still because unlike michael owen he missed the end of last season as well and unlike michael he has had an injection in his achilles
7017112 it will be a little bit longer for him but he is close he came back into training two days this week and was absolutely outstanding so it wont be long
7017113 claudio cacapa has not trained with us i was going to involve him at old trafford maybe play him but on the friday he just tweaked his hamstring
7017114 but he is not far off being fit again because it didnt go he just got a warning he had had one the week before so we just eased back on it
7017115 i would say another two weeks and he will be back
7017116 what we have got to do with joey is just try to assess where his fitness is
7017117 it is all right to come in and play a game but how will he react after it
7017118 i want to try to keep moving up the rankings and i think its time for me to go a little bit further at a grand slam
7017119 i have the potential to do that but you try not to look so far ahead go one match at a time just see what happens because once you get into the second week anything can happen
7017120 i think im stronger mentally and physically this season my game hasnt changed a whole lot but when youre physically in better shape it gives you extra confidence
7017121 you go on the court just worrying about the tennis instead of other things it gives you a better peace of mind
7017122 its hard but i think if you want to win slams in any era you will have to have beaten great players to do it
7017123 its very hard to do but its definitely not impossible you have to go into for me anyway every tournament to win
7017124 i always feel if you set a goal to reach the third round if you do make it to the third round you almost are satisfied with what you achieved
7017125 it is very important to meet their needs inside the club the way we play the way we behave with success on the field and in financial rewards if you can achieve that as a club you can keep them together
7017126 i dont feel at our club you have to make any other sacrifice than financial because all the other aspects are better at our club than anywhere else
7017127 if you do not balance the books you go bankrupt and die i could push the club into big debt
7017128 i go away with success and the guy who comes after me suffers for five years because he cannot buy a player any more and the club goes down
7017129 i want to try to keep moving up the rankings and i think its time for me to go a little bit further at a grand slam

7017192 nadal is obviously playing really well but i think this surface and grand slam he has struggled at
7017193 federer is playing really well but his performance has dropped a little bit and beating djokovic a couple of times recently has given me confidence
7017194 its hard but i think if you want to win slams in any era you will have to have beaten great players to do it
7017195 its very hard to do but its definitely not impossible you have to go into for me anyway every tournament to win

7017225 i guess i just touched wheels early on went into a gully and went over the bars
7017226 that wasnt the worst thing my bars were twisted i had to ride to the pits the mechanic had to work on the bike and it was just mentally a little bit frustrating
7017227 i took it steady rode at my own pace the distance we had to do meant you almost rode one notch back

7017234 the algae additionally produce substances which react similar to melanin in human skins mycosporin amino acids maa
7017235 we examine the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation on algae and their protective mechanisms
7017236 our investigations show that the distribution of certain species of brown algae is inhibited by the climate of ultraviolet radiation the algae are displaced into deeper water layers if ultraviolet radiation increases

7017242 it is very important to meet their needs inside the club the way we play the way we behave with success on the field and in financial rewards if you can achieve that as a club you can keep them together
7017243 i dont feel at our club you have to make any other sacrifice than financial because all the other aspects are better at our club than anywhere else
7017244 if you do not balance the books you go bankrupt and die i could push the club into big debt
7017245 i go away with success and the guy who comes after me suffers for five years because he cannot buy a player any more and the club goes down
7017246 i am definitely not interested myself im happy enough with my development squad
7017247 its the most serious appointment that the county board will make in a long long time
7017248 the next appointment has to be the correct one and its not just a case of the county board delegates coming together and putting proposals and names forward or whatever and the county board making a decision on that setanta readers comment of the day
7017249 i want to try to keep moving up the rankings and i think its time for me to go a little bit further at a grand slam
7017250 i have the potential to do that but you try not to look so far ahead go one match at a time just see what happens because once you get into the second week anything can happen
7017251 i think im stronger mentally and physically this season my game hasnt changed a whole lot but when youre physically in better shape it gives you extra confidence
7017252 you go on the court just worrying about the tennis instead of other things it gives you a better peace of mind
7017253 its hard but i think if you want to win slams in any era you will have to have beaten great players to do it

7017256 mark viduka will probably be a couple of weeks still because unlike michael owen he missed the end of last season as well and unlike michael he has had an injection in his achilles

7017258 claudio cacapa has not trained with us i was going to involve him at old trafford maybe play him but on the friday he just tweaked his hamstring
7017259 but he is not far off being fit again because it didnt go he just got a warning he had had one the week before so we just eased back on it
7017260 i would say another two weeks and he will be back
7017261 what we have got to do with joey is just try to assess where his fitness is
7017262 it is all right to come in and play a game but how will he react after it
7017263 no ive been bad lassing it and thought i might have caught a std
7017264 i do not know about you but i know about me that i did not come here to feel safe i came here to engage and to learn through experiences be it nice or not so nice

7017297 the defendant emailed them using a false email address saying he came from the travel company and there was a protracted chain of emails about why he had not refunded the money the theft came to light when the group got hold of the real travel company who said there had never been any booking for this stag do
7017298 he is genuinely remorseful at the time he was suffering from acute depression and his relationship had come to an end
7017299 these were mean spirited offences exploiting friendship that was given to you by other members of the group it was a breach of trust

7017306 chase presented with a rather improbable combination of cognitive and psychotic symptoms significantly complicating clinical assessment
7017307 it is my professional opinion that mr chase is currently malingering symptoms of psychiatric disorder
7017308 i do not understand why the doctor says i am faking symptoms
7017309 i have never faked symptoms this is why i think the courts are against me
7017310 the cops are in the wall with my mom and judge trying to kill me

7017318 congratulations to michael phelps for winning eight olympic gold medals i applaud him and his mother for speaking about ad hd mr phelps shows that its possible to go beyond coping with ad hd and truly achieve his candor addresses stigma and hopefully will inspire others to seek help
7017319 its important for people living with ad hd to pursue interests they enjoy and at which they excel
7017320 phelpss success demonstrates that being a part of a supportive family setting goals engaging in enjoyable activities and receiving positive feedback are all important in building self esteem phelps is clearly an exceptionally talented athlete and a source of pride for the millions of people affected by ad hd
7017321 among men there is a deep stigma associated with seeking treatment for ad hd i hope that michael phelpss openness conveys to young men that its okay to seek treatment that it is part of a wise game plan
7017322 its obvious to everyone who watched the olympic games that mr phelps has an engaged supportive and enthusiastic family who helped him find his right fit with swimming
7017323 i was told the whale sharks skin was rough so i took a scraper along with me and scratched its back it slowed down the next day it returned and i did the same thing it obviously enjoyed it by day three it was there waiting to have its back scratched

7017329 i even played rugby against idi amin he was a popular second row forward in the kings african rifles

7017336 it is the first time in europe since the cold war that a foreign army has entered the territory of a sovereign state without any internationally accepted legal basis if we were to be ambivalent about this it would give tacit approval to put our country and our citizens under threat
7017337 ukraine has to move towards the nato alliance it is the only way for our country to protect our national security and sovereignty when the borders of nato expand so too does the region of peace and stability
7017338 we need to increase the military budget so that there is no question about what happens tomorrow
7017339 the peace and security of europe are under threat thus a united europe should give a robust and appropriate response
7017340 triggered star formation continues to be very hard to prove

7017342 our first look at this region suggests we are looking at one or two generations of stars that were triggered by the massive stars
7017343 we plan to follow up with even more detailed measurements of the stars ages to see if there is a distinct time gap between the stars just inside and outside the rim

7017384 mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7017385 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
7017386 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
7017387 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7017388 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
7017389 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
7017390 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training

7017394 climate change will greatly complicate and could undermine efforts to manage these challenges
7017395 it isnt that other plants cant grow as well its just that poison ivy grows so much more
7017396 its going to be like a one two punch more poison ivy and more poisonous poison ivy

7017399 you want to see poison ivy cmon over ill show you poison ivy
7017400 i really do think that vines are growing a heck of a lot more crazily than they were 20 years ago
7017401 and this year with all the rain well everything loves the rain just walking around ive seen very healthy colonies of poison ivy
7017402 can be in a small cluster or in upright bush form
7017403 people have to recognize that something we find not very useful has value in the world
7017404 aside from just the fact there might be a lot of birds and critters that can consume the berries and deer that eat the foliage these are carbon sinks these are actually taking up carbon
7017405 at this point there are two things awareness and education
7017406 when you do come in contact with it wash it off as soon as possible
7017407 more than enough food is produced to feed a healthy global population distribution and access to food is a problem many are hungry while at the same time many overeat
7017408 we are providing food to take care of not only our necessary consumption but also our wasteful habits
7017409 as much as half of the water used to grow food globally may be lost or wasted
7017410 curbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win win opportunities for farmers business ecosystems and the global hungry
7017411 an effective water saving strategy requires that minimizing food wastage is firmly placed on the political agenda
7017412 thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion liters of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
7017413 saving water from field to fork curbing losses and wastage in the food chain
7017414 unless we change our practices water will be a key constraint to food production in the future
7017415 people toss the food they buy and all the resources used to grow ship and produce the food along with it
7017416 improving water productivity and reducing the quantity of food that is wasted can enable us to provide a better diet for the poor and enough food for growing populations
7017417 reaching the target we propose a 50 percent reduction of losses and wastage in the production and consumption chain is a necessary and achievable goal
7017418 saving water from field to fork curbing losses and wastage in the food chain
7017419 the improved understanding of trade and water management issues on local regional and global scales are of the highest relevance for the successful and sustainable use of water resources

7017421 clint eastwood made two films about iwo jima that ran for more than four hours total and there was not one negro actor on the screen if you reporters had any balls youd ask him why
7017422 has he ever studied history african american soldiers didnt raise the flag
7017423 if i go ahead and put an african american actor in there theyd say
7017424 the man is not my father and were not on a plantation either im not making this up i know history
7017425 its over i said what i had to say he believes what he believes and thats that
7017426 hey you cant film that movie about george washington crossing the delaware because you dont have any black people in the boat with him
7017427 you can read his books and not feel like a dumb fan hes like those french critics who write about films in a way that makes you feel like its art

7017430 i was fired for running too many jazz reviews stuff like archie shepp miles davis and santana
7017431 zeppelin was bigger than the stones then but no one knew it
7017432 i thought it was hilarious that a straight magazine like the atlantic would run a story so full of sex drugs and rock n roll
7017433 as i recall all that mystical stuff in the book jimmy pages interest in aleister crowley for example was stephens inference
7017434 mick fleetwood was going into bankruptcy and called me up
7017435 within a couple of months i got a book advance and mick had 100 000 in his pocket
7017436 at a very young age stephen dubbed me the eagle woman of rock n roll and that made me feel good a bit like isis
7017437 there are very few historical documents about rock n roll that dont have my name in them
7017438 its never the whole story when it has to get past the wives but that book comes close
7017439 of all of my books that one is also the most drug soaked which is saying something
7017440 he was embedded kind of like the reporters in iraq
7017441 what stephen wrote was more like an mri than a snapshot steven and joe felt like they told him too much but my position was why expend energy keeping secrets
7017442 its five guys from nowhere who go in search of fame and fortune and find unlimited gold instead of a chariot they have a private plane

7017450 theres less than one percent of the population of iowa that is african american there is probably less than four of five percent that are minorities what is in washington so look it goes back to what you start off with what youre dealing with
7017451 when you have children coming from dysfunctional homes when you have children coming from homes where theres no books where the mother from the time theyre born doesnt talk to them as opposed to the mother in iowa whos sitting out there and talks to them the kid starts out with a 300 word larger vocabulary at age three half this education gap exists before the kid steps foot in the classroom
7017452 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man

7017455 in order to look tough hes undermined his ability to be tough were he president because if youre going to go into pakistan which is already our policy by the way if theres actionable intelligence you need actionable intelligence from moderates within pakistan working with you now if youre already going to say im going to disregard whatever the country thinks and going to invade the likelihood youre getting the cooperation you need evaporates its a well intended notion he has but its a very na ve way of figuring out how youre going to conduct foreign policy

7017499 milwaukee is kind of an unexpected location but i think it has a lot to do with kurt getting back to his roots he and his wife grew up here and hes kind of coming back home and seeing what he can do for the area
7017500 i met kurt through a wisconsin area music industry wami meeting and we were just throwing ideas out there we wanted to have bands come in to avoid sending a amp r staff out all over the place we have hopefully thirty or forty bands coming here tomorrow random records will be able to get an idea of bands within 100 or 200 miles of us in just one afternoon
7017501 weve got three control rooms and when a band comes in were going to give them a tour of the studio and then theyll meet with executives from random records for album or demo listening
7017502 i would say the number one thing we have is a very large live room with good acoustics and three control rooms
7017503 i really believe there is a viable music industry in the area i believe as a community and its something we work with at wami we need to improve the music scene in wisconsin
7017504 we hope the listening party sparks a dialogue with several bands and get more material and take a look at their live performances ive sat with kurt through a couple of critiques before and hes definitely looking for the song and a hook something catchy that is going to hit people on the radio

7017519 we must pay more attention to maintaining state security and social stability we must boost our consciousness of safeguarding the power of the regime and fully develop our functions as a department for proletarian dictatorship

7017524 i deeply regret any offense my remark in the new york observer might have caused anyone that was not my intent and i expressed that to sen obama
7017525 barack obama is probably the most exciting candidate that the democratic or republican party has produced at least since ive been around
7017526 my mother has an expression clean as a whistle sharp as a tack
7017527 i told him it wasnt necessary we have got more important things to worry about we have got iraq we have got health care we have got energy this is low on the list
7017528 he was very gracious and i have no problem with joe biden
7017529 i didnt take sen bidens comments personally but obviously they were historically inaccurate african american presidential candidates like jesse jackson shirley chisholm carol moseley braun and al sharpton gave a voice to many important issues through their campaigns and no one would call them inarticulate
7017530 im running because i believe this administration has dug a very deep hole in terms of both our foreign policy and domestic policy
7017531 knowing joe biden the way i do im sure he didnt mean it as off color but it is certainly highly suggestive

7017536 health care professionals should not be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience
7017537 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
7017538 fails to give assurances that current laws about abortion will not be stretched to cover birth control
7017539 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
7017540 it is very closely focused on abortion and a physicians conscience
7017541 this proposal ensures that doctors and other medical personnel will retain the constitutional right to listen to their own conscience when it comes to performing or participating in an abortion
7017542 these regulations will ensure that pro life medical personnel will not be forced to engage in the unconscionable killing of innocent human life
7017543 there appears to be an attitude toward the health care professions that health care professionals and institutions should be required to provide or assist in the provision of medicine or procedures to which they object or else risk being subjected to discrimination
7017544 in some instances the standards of professional organizations have been used to define the exercise of conscience to be unprofessional forcing health care professionals to choose between their capacity to practice in good standing and their right of conscience
7017545 freedom of expression and action are unfit barter for admission to medical employment or training
7017546 i am not happy about al jazeera infiltrating our small town and portraying us however they see fit
7017547 we treated them like any other news organization we believe in the first amendment freedom of speech freedom of press is so vitally important
7017548 i think its unfortunate when people try to stifle different voices when people dont want to hear or allow other people to hear what is being said
7017549 doesnt have the right to restrict or prohibit al jazeera or any other news agency from broadcasting out of the city whether we approve of their coverage or not whether we share their perspectives or not whether we find their coverage offensive or not

7017565 these unborn babies are the throw aways of our society
7017566 they were killed in violent acts of abortion and literally thrown away in the trash destined to find their final resting place with garbage in a land fill when we found them we discovered the awful secret of their hidden and silent deaths
7017567 sometimes you have to lie to a patient about things they want to do
7017568 joins an ever increasing list of abortionists who are facing criminal charges across the nation
7017569 this trend demonstrates that while abortionists believe and act as if they are above the law states are beginning to see how dangerous these clinics are and are beginning to crack down on them with the help of pro life whistleblowers
7017570 clearly colorado voters are not jumping up and down about the dnc being held in denver
7017571 im 300 miles away so it really doesnt affect me

7017575 let the record show that john mccain and barack obama are polar opposites on partial birth abortion parental notification of abortion marriage protection on the ballot homosexual indoctrination of schoolchildren gay adoptions gun owner rights activist judges and raising taxes
7017576 no one should base their vote on personality or mere feelings our carefully researched report card shows you exactly where obama and mccain stand on issues of importance to voters their families and our nations future
7017577 barack has made crystal clear his commitment to ensuring full euqlaity for lgbt couples thats why he opposes all divisive and discriminatory constitutuional amendments whether its a proposed amendment to the california and florida constitutions or the u s constitution
7017578 that you know the fact is my nine year old and my six year olds i think are already aware that there are same sex couples and my wife and i have already talked about it
7017579 we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
7017580 guarantees an individual right to keep and bear arms and to argue anything else is to reject the clear meaning of our founding fathers
7017581 has pledged to veto any tax increase and says he supports making existing tax cuts permanent
7017582 the american people have come together to say that partial birth abortion offends our national conscience that taxpayers should not be forced to pay for elective abortions and that states should be allowed to enact parental notification laws
7017583 the international herald tribune has long valued the moscow times as an excellent source of news about russia since february 2006 this mutual respect and shared news values have led the two papers to form a valuable partnership that has made the iht the only english language international daily available in moscows morning on the day it is printed there since it started out 15 years ago edited by meg bortin now a senior editor at the iht the moscow times has shown that it is possible to maintain high journalistic standards and to use those best practices to shed valuable light on events in russia which are often hard for foreigners to understand its reporters and editors are professional the quality of their work is evident in the large number of ex moscow times journalists who now work at other media from the wall street journal to bloomberg news the mt is a rightly esteemed and treasured part of the moscow landscape and the iht can only wish the newspaper and its sister publication in st petersburg continued success in the future
7017584 we understand the essence of the russian position and its military response
7017585 i want to express my support for the russian position in abkhazia and south ossetia we oppose attempts to tarnish russias position
7017586 we are ready to consider requests from the syrian side on buying more arms
7017587 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons that dont break the regional balance of powers

7017590 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7017591 its a well intentioned notion he has but its a very na ve way of thinking how youre going to conduct foreign policy
7017592 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
7017593 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7017594 you may end up going against a senate colleague perhaps mccain perhaps frist
7017595 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage

7017597 death conceals everything but truth and strips a man of everything but genius and virtue
7017598 08 if it didnt change anyone else it definitely changed me yesterday i was undecided this morning i am officially a republican for obama
7017599 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be

7017668 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7017669 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7017670 i am not in that arena this is his decision
7017671 i respect him to make it however he believes is best of him and for our party and our country
7017672 obviously the most important question is is this person prepared to be president
7017673 the second most important question from my perspective is can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7017674 and the third criteria for me i think was independence i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
7017675 one of the things that we said at the very beginning of this process was that we werent going to talk about this process we werent going to talk about the candidates until senator obama walked out on stage with his vice presidential nominee
7017676 thank god we got the silver though we went for the gold
7017677 the temperature it actually affected both countries and most players did not play to their best abilities because of the heat

7017681 i also want to thank barcelona coach pep guardiola he made a very beautiful gesture towards me and now i can talk to him as olympic champion to olympic champion
7017682 i made very good friends here and the experience of having lived for a few days in the olympic village surrounded by such important sportsmen was also very beautiful
7017683 thank god we got the silver though we went for the gold
7017684 the coach did well and the boys need encouragement we will go back to the drawing board and prepare for the world cup

7017716 serangan jantung merupakan kerosakan pada otot jantung akibat terputusnya bekalan darah arteri koronari secara tiba tiba kejadian ini berlaku apabila salah satu arteri tersebut tersumbat disebabkan gumpalan darah
7017717 gumpalan darah ini pula terjadi akibat pecahnya plak ateroma dalam salur darah arteri koronari itu sekiranya gumpalan darah ini tidak dihilangkan dengan segera maka otot jantung akan mati dan seterusnya mengakibatkan kematian kepada penghidapnya

7017726 mengapa dim sum seperti semua sedia maklum dim sum antara makanan tradisi masyarakat cina secara turun temurun tidak lengkap rasanya jika pelancong asing pulang tanpa menikmati keenakan asli hidangan dim sum
7017727 sebelum ini orang muslim selalu mengeluh kerana sukar mencari dim sum halal lalu saya mengambil keputusan mengusahakan kantin ini bersama isteri maryam markar 35 khas buat masyarakat islam
7017728 jangan bimbang kerana petugas masjid mempunyai senarai restoran halal untuk pengunjung muslim bukan itu sahaja anda juga boleh mendapatkan makanan halal di gerai gerai yang dibuka di sekitar masjid
7017729 seperti saya sebaik sahaja sampai ke sini terpinga pinga juga mencari restoran dan pasar yang menjual bahan mentah halal tapi masalah tersebut dapat diselesaikan selepas mendapat bantuan daripada pihak masjid
7017730 kebanyakan daging lembu kambing dan ayam diimport dari brazil dan china memandangkan hong kong masih belum memiliki pusat penyembelihan halal namun begitu terdapat juga isi daging seperti ikan segar dan daging ayam dijual di pasar tempatan yang disembelih oleh penjual beragama islam
7017731 biasanya imam masjid amar yang menjalankan proses pemeriksaan restoran dan pasar sebelum si pemilik layak menerima sijil dan logo halal daging halal yang dijual di kedai muslim pula perlu dibungkus rapi dan dilekatkan tanda halal

7017737 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee

7017739 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone
7017740 we need your help to keep building this movement for change

7017742 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience
7017743 but 20 years of experience that has not been very solid in terms of projecting what was going to happen just doesnt make you a better commander in chief
7017744 we dont need as a commander in chief a war hero johns a war hero we need someone with some wisdom

7017750 value stocks with stable cash flows and a potential catalyst
7017751 in light of the pullback in these stocks one of the major things we are thinking about is the likelihood that we will see a bounce out of energy and materials
7017752 we underperformed because we were overweight one of the worst performing sectors of the s amp p consumer cyclicals and underweight the best performing sector energy
7017753 in the past couple of years we have helped over 1 000 people of this area to get jobs in various industries and about 120 youths have also been provided employment in foreign countries
7017754 we demanded that rahul issue directions for timely payments to the sugarcane farmers

7017762 a million dollar pimp who seduces the worst of american culture
7017763 i offered my condolences no one should have to go through life looking like me i told him you poor thing have you considered surgery its the pinnacle of your career and you have to play me imagine having to put that on your r sum i was jerry springer oh great
7017764 the public jerry springer is a persona which deserves to have the piss taken out of it
7017765 the show couldnt work without the persona weve created ive always separated the private from the public there is no tension and no fake ego away from the screen i have this wonderful life and yet i can go to the office and become this larger than life celebrity who gets into trouble i never combine the two personas because that would destroy them both
7017766 we are all born as empty vessels which can be shaped by moral values
7017767 you could dress up the nazis and teach them how to speak and assume that they would take moral decisions
7017768 everyone talks quite rightly about the horror of the holocaust
7017769 but think of the fear from 1933 onwards the constant terror of knowing that tonight you might get a knock on the door and the gestapo might take you away i cant imagine that was anything other than horrific
7017770 one of the reasons i wanted to make who do you think you are was to find out what happened to my family because my parents didnt want to talk about it
7017771 theyd talk about the war in general terms and then stop in mid sentence it was too painful for them they wouldnt even watch the sound of music because of the nazi uniforms in that film you dont want to make your parents uncomfortable but i wish now that i had sat them down and said tell me all about it but survivors always say once you open that door you can never shut it again if i let you into that room youll never leave
7017772 i can quite understand their reticence it would be as if at your age someone came to your house arrested your relatives and forced you to flee to pakistan you didnt speak the language or know a soul but worst of all you had no idea what had happened to any of your family how would you lead a normal life after that my parents were determined to live an independent life in america but they only managed to appear normal by suppressing all that horror
7017773 you know when you read those historical novels and theres a fictional character placed in the middle of major events hes a friend of churchills or he worked for stalin that was my family whatever happened to europe in the last 200 years my family was in the middle of it
7017774 in neustettin during the 1880s my great grandfather abraham was the head of the first jewish temple in europe to be burnt down in 700 years that was the start of all the recent anti semitism the next generation had rocks thrown through their windows and were sent to the death camps then the next generation escaped to america its like my family has been in the middle of a historical novel
7017775 britain saved my parents life they were real anglophiles im an american but i have a phenomenal love for this country im always looking for work here not because i need a job but because im looking for an excuse to come here ill always be grateful churchill is a human god and i wouldnt be here talking to you if it wasnt for him
7017776 it was instinctive for me to be involved with civil liberties you dont have to be lectured about tolerance when your family has been through the holocaust
7017777 the establishment say get rid of these people and call them trash
7017778 its a stupid show and ive never said anything else but theres something in me that enjoys defending it against the elite who get so bent out of shape about it its funny watching them huffing and puffing when in reality they behave in exactly the same way as the people on the show
7017779 western civilisation has been around for thousands of years so i suppose it must be time to give another system a shot its obviously not fair that were always number one i must say i thought that the holocaust was a bit more of a threat to western civilisation but call me crazy
7017780 were not out there touting the show as having redeeming social value
7017781 absolutely not if you want to see people having an effect watch the news a show in which people shout at each other about relationships pales in comparison to genocide say or the catastrophe of aids in africa so many people in the world have really serious problems that i have difficulty getting concerned when critics start yelling about a tv show ultimately its like complaining about a meal in a restaurant its not going to change the world get over it
7017782 there has been a wall of criticism of the states in recent times some of it justified but it strikes me as amazing that just seven years after 9 11 someone called barack obama an african american with an islamic name could become president to me that indicates a very open society no matter what the government does people are cool we americans can be boisterous but instinctively we come out on the right side good for america i feel proud of that
7017783 i think it will be a great benefit it may be wishful thinking on my part but even though its currently popular to say bad things about america i think deep down most of the world doesnt hate my country are people around the world angry with america absolutely and quite legitimately but do they go to bed at night thinking america is going to attack them no everywhere is safe
7017784 that never made sense to me even if bush was telling the truth about weapons of mass destruction in fact particularly if he was telling the truth about weapons of mass destruction why the hell would you bomb a country that could fire back that would be insane bush did real damage to americas reputation around the world
7017785 you cant have the government determining how long people are imprisoned for
7017786 thats the job of the courts habeas corpus is a right that goes back to the magna carta and governments cant infringe upon that
7017787 but its not absolutely necessary i feel i get more of a voice talking to people like you my current profile gives me a phenomenal platform people encourage me all the time to enter formal politics they know im liberal and outspoken but i think i get on tv more now talking about these issues than i would if i were a senator thats the advantage of celebrity
7017788 id have preferred not to have provided the material for this programme but i hope that people watch it and that it provokes discussion
7017789 above all i hope people remember that the holocaust happened in our lifetime and was carried out by people who looked just like us its so easy to pass it off as a tribal thing that happened 800 years ago wrong it happened in the most civilised society in europe a culture that had great music and literature
7017790 the story has more effect when its about an individual
7017791 when you say six million people were killed it loses its force because people cant get their heads around that number but when you personalise it it has a far greater impact you can immediately imagine your own grandmother in that situation
7017792 i hope the programme makes you think about one thing
7017793 never been changed since the restaurant opened almost 100 years ago
7017794 if you are watching your health id recommend going next door
7017795 one pound of ground longhorn beef topped with cheese bacon jalape o slices
7017796 its tough non fatty stuff that holds the muscle fibres of the meat if you dont get it out it wraps itself round the spindle of your mincer
7017797 refrigerate the grinder to chill thoroughly a warm grinder can warm the meat
7017798 this brief curing makes the meat retain moisture better and enhances the texture
7017799 the gently gathered ground beef in a good hamburger has a delicate quality quite unlike even a tender steak
7017800 the combination of meat is very good if you can find short rib it produces a pleasing greasiness
7017801 well use his recipe when we have hamburgers again maybe in two or three years
7017802 nows a good time to talk to someone you love
7017803 this is a good time for you to get up off your fat ass and get some exercise
7017804 nows a good time to take that bath youve been postponing
7017805 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone we need your help to keep building this movement for change

7017808 when there is no enemy within the enemies outside cannot hurt you
7017809 in fact its almost 100 percent more this year than it was the previous two years
7017810 theres no question theres a variety of suggestions that people are in fact returning
7017811 remittances which is the money immigrants send home to mexico have gone down dramatically over the past year again probably part the economy but also part enforcement leading to fewer people being here
7017812 so the mother is saying we should return home with the breadwinner of the family to mexico and the children are saying i dont want to leave im a u s citizen i dont know that country
7017813 immigration judges should have the tools necessary to control their courtrooms and protect the adjudicatory system from fraud and abuse
7017814 this proposed rule seeks to preserve the fairness and integrity of immigration proceedings and increase the level of protection afforded to aliens in those proceedings
7017815 prejudicial to the administration of justice or undermines the integrity
7017816 the simple fact of focusing on ethical issues is a step in the right direction
7017817 but at what cost to the rest of the profession who are already providing professional and ethical representation
7017818 chi meglio di me in formula 1 solo alonso e raikkonen
7017819 we are having to amend the legislation because you can get to a lot of places and back in three days we are playing catch up to close that loophole and it is a concern that it is there work is already in place to change the law so that the three day window is closed
7017820 at the moment we can place foreign travel orders on convicted sex offenders which stop them going abroad once on the sex offenders register but they have to be applied for through the magistrates courts and only last six months
7017821 we plan to extend that period and to introduce the immediate removal of an offenders passport these things are going to come in but they are not in place at the moment we hope they will be introduced as soon as possible
7017822 falls far far below what is acceptable for western european standards of justice
7017823 mr gadd is pleased to be back in this country the last few days as you know he has been travelling around asia and that time was not wasted
7017824 mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety
7017825 these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into place a proper procedure for his protection and his well being im pleased to say thats in place
7017826 mr gadd is pleased to be back for another reason he is pleased to be back because for the first time he can appear before a court of justice he tells me that his trial in vietnam was a charade was a travesty of justice

7017856 en l neas generales podemos enorgullecernos de lo que hemos hecho aqu en pek n antes de que empezara esta final notamos cierta falta de respeto por nuestro equipo muchos no nos concedieron ni siquiera el beneficio de la duda al final creo que tenemos razones para tener a mucha honra el trabajo que hemos hecho en pek n ahora estamos desilusionados porque hemos perdido la final pero en el futuro recordaremos todo esto con orgullo
7017857 de hecho poca gente se imaginaba que llegar amos hasta aqu los hemos dejado a todos en evidencia
7017858 formamos una gran familia y las familias no se rompen porque no les salgan las cosas del todo bien podemos sentirnos orgullosos

7017870 did you know you just yelled at them to stop yelling

7017872 i think he has played very well in the olympic tournament
7017873 hes played very well today as he normally does in his position and i knew that he could probably be the deciding factor
7017874 i think it the game had been played in another part of the day it would have been very different
7017875 we tried to make sure that we didnt get uptight just too play our own game
7017876 we wanted to play with intelligence and move the ball around and not run around so much we wanted the ball to do the work
7017877 i mean youve got the first sort of mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a story book man
7017878 this should be a pretty good year for leaf color change
7017879 although there was enough rainfall this spring to keep the trees healthy we are still in drought conditions in the western part of the state which surprisingly is good for fall color fortunately the summer temperatures have not been as consistently hot as we had last year so we should not experience the early leaf drop we had last fall it all adds up to a nice long progression of fall color
7017880 i think we should have brighter colors but it may not last as long because of the late summer drought
7017881 die diskussion reicht bis in das jahr 1995 zur ck das 120 gramm ziel ist seit mehr als zehn jahre bekannt
7017882 tats chlich haben wir nun 130 gramm vorgeschlagen und weitere zehn gramm durch den sogenannten integrierten ansatz also wirklich was wir auf den tisch gelegt haben ist ein kompromiss

7017893 its very clear that for a long period of time there may have been people in different parts of this province right here and elsewhere who were at risk and whose safety was in peril because the tssa was asleep at the switch

7017919 so neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything but only god gives the growth you are gods field
7017920 to plant is to evangelize and to bring to faith to water is to baptize with the approved form of words to forgive sins however and to give the spirit belongs to god alone

7017927 as for the defense of our citizens outside the country the use of force to defend ones compatriots is traditionally regarded as a form of self defense countries such as the united states britain france and israel have at numerous times resorted to the use of armed force to defend their citizens outside national borders

7017932 if my narrative tells us nothing else it at least shows that not much has changed in the last hundred years the storming of embassies by frenzied mobs the murder of diplomats and the dispatch of warships to the persian gulf all these were only too familiar to our victorian forebears indeed the headlines of today are often indistinguishable from those of a century or more ago

7017945 have i ever asked you not to buy shoes i always want you to buy more shoes
7017946 thats not the point i dont want to buy more shoes but how can you have so many shoes you dont use half of them anyway i never see you wearing most of them i am going to donate all the shoes you dont wear
7017947 there are just my four pairs of sneakers 4 5 pairs of black shoes which youll agree are absolutely essential 4 pairs of brown shoes which are also essential then my golf shoes my hiking shoes winter boots and a few others
7017948 why dont you buy more shoes if you want to have more shoes than me

7017956 its almost the perfect storm when people get sick they cannot get a timely appointment with their primary care provider and they have to wait for hours to be seen in a crowded emergency department
7017957 meanwhile the government and insurance carriers continue to cut payments and avoid reimbursing for services its hard to imagine either candidate can keep the ship afloat without a major change in direction
7017958 we envision a substantial role for viruses that is therapeutic viruses in 21st century medicine
7017959 we rely on our eyes every time we step into a car especially our peripheral vision depth perception and focusing skills
7017960 this link between vision and driving makes it essential for motorists to take steps to maintain healthy vision just as they take other safety precautions on the road
7017961 most people are aware of the dangers of drinking and driving but are unaware that driving drowsy can be just as fatal
7017962 in fact traffic safety and sleep experts believe that drowsy driving is much more common than even federal statistics indicate
7017963 potential causes of higher mortality in elderly users of conventional and atypical antipsychotic medications
7017964 the path we have followed to improve this communitys health crosses ethnic lines and geographic boundaries
7017965 we hope that our work in south philadelphia will guide the u s healthcare system towards a more equitable and effective future that ultimately ensures the wellness of all americans
7017966 the approach is a new application of the well known botanical phenomenon of aerial root development
7017967 instead of using plant branches this patented approach takes malleable roots and shapes them into useful objects for indoors and out
7017968 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
7017969 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
7017970 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
7017971 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
7017972 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
7017973 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
7017974 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine
7017975 since vitamin d is produced in the skin through solar or uv irradiation and high serum levels have been shown to correlate with a reduced risk of ms this suggests that vitamin d may regulate the immune response and may promote a hosts reaction to a pathogen
7017976 evidence has shown that the maintenance of an adequate vitamin d level may have a protective effect in individuals predisposed to ms
7017977 one device of vitamin d action may be to preserve balance in the t cell reaction and thus avoid autoimmunity
7017978 elderly voters especially elderly voters who live in long term care settings are at the mercy of others when it comes to exercising their right to vote
7017979 operations research offers a powerful set of tools that have been used successfully in everything from world war ii to wal mart style logistics planning these tools ought to be used to increase the success of existing programs and to help expand access to hiv care and treatment in resource limited countries
7017980 for example operations research could help with the planning of a national drug distribution system or with predicting the demand for services at local clinics and the best ways to staff them
7017981 to date hiv treatment scale up has appropriately focused first on policy level issues such as program initiation and costs and secondarily on operational level issues
7017982 now that many programs are in place the potential gains from improved planning are great especially given the high cost of antiretroviral drug therapy
7017983 the analysis suggested that implementation of such a program could allow the government of rwanda to scale up hiv treatment without overburdening its existing health care system
7017984 the unique advantage of operations research is that it gives us the ability to evaluate and optimize outcomes of various scenarios such as determining the best approach for the management of lab equipment repair without impacting patients
7017985 once we have the evidence for a new approach a good case can be made that it should be implemented as policy although any initiative should take into account the environments in which the projects are to be carried out with all necessary ethical cultural and political considerations
7017986 placing greater emphasis on long term strategic planning and increasing the attention and resources directed to capacity building for sustainability
7017987 while laudable progress has been made the great majority of hiv patients are still under treated or untreated
7017988 we feel that operations research provides one of the tools to make sure progress continues
7017989 this area of research and specifically this and other projects led by drs hupert and xiong shows how fields such as the engineering sciences can contribute to solving medical and public health problems
7017990 only safe animal dietary supplements are allowed on the market
7017991 prior research has suggested that the trend in strokes was increasing but our study shows declining incidence in stroke for non diabetic men both for first and recurrent stroke and in recurrent strokes in non diabetic women
7017992 the impressive decline in smoking and large decreases in cholesterol levels and to a lesser degree blood pressure levels in the population of northern sweden may have contributed to the declining incidence in both diabetic and non diabetic subjects over the study period
7017993 on the other hand we found more recurrent events among diabetic subjects than non diabetic subjects indicating a need for even more intensive secondary prevention among diabetic patients
7017994 the fact that patients with diabetes to a great extent had favorable time trends similar to those of non diabetics is particularly interesting considering that diabetic patients with heart attack from the same population did not show any positive trends over the 19 year study
7017995 along with all the things that parents know are important for helping keep their kids healthy like washing hands and getting enough sleep flu vaccination should be right up there but this survey shows us that we still have a lot of educating to do
7017996 as a community we need to do a better job spreading the word about how important a yearly flu vaccine can be in helping protect kids and ourselves from influenza
7017997 these findings shed light on why in listening environments such as noisy parties or restaurants it is more difficult to follow a conversation involving many people where the relevant talker often and unexpectedly changes locations than to focus on one talker at one location exclusively
7017998 in addition these results may have implications for visual attention in tasks where object formation and target segmentation is challenging or where the identity of a visual object depends upon continuity of visual features over time
7017999 we and others had demonstrated the existence of a dna detection pathway within cells but we are still early in our understanding
7018000 our findings offer an important piece of evidence that this pathway is not only very relevant but it can be the cause of severe autoimmune disease
7018001 just as commensal bacteria outnumber our own cells by four or five orders of magnitude endogenous retroelements outnumber our genes by at least 100 fold
7018002 both have the potential to be detected by the immune system and cause autoimmune disease therefore specific mechanisms evolved to prevent this and trex1 represents the first example of a mechanism to prevent autoimmunity caused by endogenous retroelements
7018003 its important now to find compounds that can be used in imaging because the earlier clinicians can detect the disease the better the chances are that a drug will halt disease progression while patients still have strong cognitive abilities
7018004 when we added these compounds to the reaction their interaction with the tau protein inhibited filaments from forming which could be valuable for therapeutics because it would prevent the formation of tau tangles some people think if we clear away the pathology seen in diseased brains that might alleviate symptoms of alzheimers disease

7018008 the impact of climate change on human and global security could extend far beyond the limited scope the world has seen thus far
7018009 most critical for human survival are water and food which are sensitive to changing climatic conditions
7018010 environmental changes caused by global warming will not only affect human living conditions but may also generate larger societal effects by threatening the infrastructures of society or by inducing social responses that aggravate the problem
7018011 the associated socio economic and political stress can undermine the functioning of communities the effectiveness of institutions and the stability of societal structures these degraded conditions could contribute to civil strife and worse armed conflict
7018012 large areas of africa are suffering from scarcity of food and fresh water resources making them more vulnerable to conflict an example is sudans darfur province where an ongoing conflict was aggravated since droughts forced arab herders to move into areas of african farmers
7018013 although climate change bears a significant conflict potential it can also transform the international system toward more cooperation if it is seen as a common threat that requires joint action
7018014 the bali roadmap has many good ideas but was criticized as being too vague to induce a major policy shift
7018015 nevertheless the seeming conflict between environment and the economy will be best overcome with the recognition that protecting the climate in the best interest of the economy
7018016 history has shown how dependent our culture is on a narrow window of climatic conditions for average temperature and precipitation
7018017 the great human civilizations began to flourish after the last ice age and some disappeared due to droughts and other adverse shifts in the climate
7018018 the consequences were quite severe in parts of europe associated with loss of harvest and population decline
7018019 riots and military conflicts became more likely as a recent empirical study has suggested
7018020 the challenge is to slow down the dynamics and stabilize the climate system at levels which are not dangerous
7018021 global warming receives now more public and political attention than a few years ago
7018022 grass roots movements are emerging in the united states for protecting the climate and developing energy alternatives involving not only many local communities and companies but also influential states such as california led by gov arnold schwarzenegger

7018063 this is a guy who lives in my neighborhood whos a professor of english in chicago who i know and who i have not received some official endorsement from hes not somebody who i exchange ideas from on a regular basis
7018064 and the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense george
7018065 so this kind of game in which anybody who i know regardless of how flimsy the relationship is is somehow somehow their ideas could be attributed to me i think the american people are smarter than that theyre not going to suggest somehow that that is reflective of my views because it obviously isnt

7018132 kalau tidak bunting tetapi tidak ketahuan siapa lakinya mungkin itu tanda tanda mau gila
7018133 kami sudah difitnah pak kami bersumpah anak kami masih perawan dia siap membuktikan dengan pemeriksaan laboratorium tidak mungkin anak kami melakukan tindakan bejat jiwa raganya sehat anak kami waras bahkan iq nya tinggi sekali dia hanya memutuskan tidak mau keluar rumah lagi sebab dia mau merdeka
7018134 itu kemerdekaan politik pak anak saya mau merdeka di dalam berekspressi
7018135 bukan begitu pak saya mengatakan bahwa anak saya tidak keluar rumah karena dia ingin merdeka di dalam berekspresi
7018136 tapi itu tidak akan bisa dilakukan di luar rumah pak sebab akan dituduh mengganggu kebebasan orang lain kami bisa diswiping
7018137 berbicara berbuat berpikir bertingkah laku berpakaian mengeluarkan pendapat dan sebagainya pak
7018138 silakan selama itu tidak mengganggu ketertiban dan hak hak orang lain bapak bebas melakukannya bahkan mengganggu pun silakan asal itu hanya terjadi di dalam pikiran bapak saja
7018139 bukan saya pak anak saya saya melaporkan apa yang menimpa anak saya
7018140 sebab dia konsisten dengan pendapatnya pak di luar rumah tidak bisa merdeka lagi berekspressi sekarang karena akan dibatasi oleh kemerdekaan orang lain jadi dia sudah beberapa bulan ini berkurung rumah tapi itu pun tidak bisa karena dia difitnah dikatakan bunting atau gila belakangan saya dengar ada yang menghasut kalau gila harus dimasukkan ke rumah gila kalau tidak akan mengganggu masyarakat
7018141 jadi ada pihak pihak yang menekan bapak supaya memasukkan anak bapak ke rumah sakit gila
7018142 kalau begitu ini salah jadi bapak sudah ditekan oleh massa untuk mengirimkan anak bapak ke rumah sakit gila
7018143 saya datang untuk meminta perlindungan berikanlah hak pada anak kami yang tidak ingin keluar rumah sebab dia ingin bebas mengekspresikan dirinya di dalam rumah dengan tidak keluar rumah sebenarnya anak saya kan mau memelihara kebebasan orang lain di luar rumah mestinya mereka berterimakasih tetapi kenapa anak saya malah difitnah
7018144 sebab dia merasa sekarang kemerdekaan sudah diartikan seenaknya oleh orang lain sehingga kemerdekaan itu membuat orang lain tidak merdeka padahal kita kan sudah setengah abad merdeka pak anak saya merasa kebebasan berekspresinya terancam di luar rumah jadi dia berkorban tidak mau keluar rumah malah diserang oleh massa saya datang untuk mendapatkan perlindungan
7018145 wah putri bapak cantik sekali wajar masyarakat protes kenapa orang secantik itu tidak mau keluar rumah lagi
7018146 a fantastic job once again from giorgio he has done an amazing job on a circuit which is new to everyone a pity about javis little mistake on his fast lap as i am sure he could have qualified in the top ten congratulations to all the boys in the team for the wonderful job i am very proud of the work they are doing
7018147 we improved a lot from free practice for the qualifying its good that giorgio took the pole and fastest lap this morning i was less than 1 1 sec off but this is a lot i was more confident with the car and with the track in qualifying compared to free practice where there was no grip no rubber on the track in qualifying it was a lot better i think i could have finished in top ten as i lost three tenths in the last corner qualifying could have gone a bit better the eight tenths to giorgio are still a big step but i am sure i can do well tomorrow its not difficult to prepare the car for tomorrow and i hope for a great race and a finish in the points
7018148 for me it went quite well i am on pole after fighting with maldonado and some other drivers after what happened in hungary it is nice we could show we are still on top its good to have the pole on a street circuit like this as you can avoid the traffic at the start to conclude i would like to say thanks to the team as they gave me a great car the car was perfect which was difficult as no one has ever raced here before
7018149 weve got mixed feelings this evening we showed that weve got quick cars and we can really go for it in the race with j r me who had a good qualifying session on the other hand kamuis accident is going to give the mechanics a lot of work tonight he hasnt any hope of scoring points tomorrow barring exceptional circumstances its frustrating but well do our best for both our drivers tomorrow and hope that well have cause for celebration at the end of the race
7018150 im happy with my first day for several races now weve had the speed to mix it with the front runners and well show it tomorrow i didnt have any problems during free practice and i was able to learn the circuit and then set the sixth quickest time in qualifying its encouraging and above all we can score points tomorrow
7018151 what can i say it was completely my fault i lost control of the car on the exit from a corner and hit the guardrail twice its pretty badly damaged and the team will have a lot of work this evening to repair it id like to thank them in advance for their efforts itll be almost impossible to score points tomorrow but ill do my very best and i wont give up
7018152 it took a while to get the car fired up this morning and i lost several laps as a result when i did get going the session was interrupted by red and yellow flags so it was quite hard to settle into a rhythm i also ran out of time to evaluate all the things we would ordinarily have tried
7018153 i tested an f3 car here in july which helped me to learn the circuit but it still takes time to adapt to driving a more powerful car and i felt i was slightly on the back foot when qualifying started in the end though the main problem was traffic that was the same for everybody of course but the session ended up being less about how quickly you could drive and more about traffic management i never managed a clear lap so that was that despite everything the car felt ok and im confident i can obtain a decent result tomorrow
7018154 it leaves me with a bit of hard work to do tomorrow but the team always gives me a great car for the race and weve shown in the past that we can fight back from positions such as this

7018177 we are looking for video art which today is already part of tomorrows breeding ground
7018178 always had the advantage as a kind of film festival for video art of being able to provide a realistic assessment of the current filmic state of development of this genre that is what defines its function as an aesthetic gauge

7018184 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7018185 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7018186 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7018187 can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7018188 the sport will change and the fans will find a way to get passionate about a piece of it

7018193 my job gets harder as people arent doing the things we spoke about on friday in the hotel saturday morning and before kick off
7018194 but patterson saw enough from his players after they were reduced to ten at wrexham to encourage him greatly and picked out keeper jake cole who had his best game to date since joining on loan from qpr
7018195 to have that sending off so early it killed the game for us
7018196 we did a 4 4 1 to stabilise things and that worked pretty well i was disappointed with their headed goal but other than that they didnt really create any thing
7018197 we knew they were going to have chances but they were all from long distance
7018198 i thought our goalkeeper was outstanding hes a young man and he didnt deserve to be on the losing side with that performance

7018244 as the waves pound against that surface they eat away at that embankment
7018245 we think if we educate people and address this people will appreciate that
7018246 theres a misconception that you cant get hurt if the waves are small but you have to be careful not to just go out there without thinking
7018247 the beaches are safe as long as youre aware of the situation
7018248 somebody is definitely not connecting the dots at the department of human services

7018254 i did this without her permission and it was wrong
7018255 this is a man obsessed with taking a woman down
7018256 shocking and shows the true lack of remorse which the judge should take into consideration at sentencing
7018257 he continues his attack on the victim with unfounded implications
7018258 larry mendte like all cbs3 employees was treated professionally and fairly during his tenure here his allegations are totally without merit
7018259 to your knowledge is everything he said accurate and correct
7018260 we will not make a specific recommendation as to what sentence the court should impose
7018261 are you pleading guilty because you are in fact guilty as charged
7018262 i do not intend to do anything at this time until i hear the judges sentence
7018263 what were going to do regarding larry and his employer
7018264 the writer of the anonymous letter had to be aware of the suggestion for community service by the district attorneys office and of lanes resistance to the suggestion

7018267 this area has probably the biggest and the longest existing population in the state
7018268 the potential for growth can be exponential if its not kept in check
7018269 we were at a loss of what it was at first because it looked like a rotor tiller came through
7018270 they were black and there were probably about a dozen of them i came out and they ran into the woods
7018271 the pigs would start eating it and theyd start mowing
7018272 they were pretty aggressive when we got closer to them
7018273 we are on an eradication program we dont want them there because of the habitat degradation the competition they pose for native wildlife and the potential for disease they could spread
7018274 if they see you coming they run the opposite way they do theyre not crazy
7018275 we are not going to be able to eradicate them

7018277 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
7018278 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
7018279 that definition of blight kept getting stretched broader and broader so it started seeming that it was just for the purpose of private development and helping a developer have a more profitable more feasible project
7018280 that condition of the subject properties consisting of retail and accessory uses is detrimental to the safety health morals or welfare of the community

7018290 this whole episode started five years ago when alycia lane came to philadelphia
7018291 alycia and i had a flirtatious unprofessional and improper relationship
7018292 i told her the truth i told her i loved her and i apologized i then immediately stopped having long dinners with alycia staying out late with alycia and i stopped allowing her to come into my office to do her makeup everyday
7018293 i can tell you point blank that if he in any way goes forward with this that in addition to being sued for the invasion of privacy i will go after him for defamation

7018297 do not fall for the claim she does community service work all the time she only goes when the station forces her or when she knows that she is going to be on tv
7018298 we were appalled to learn that but it only points out the extent to which mendte would go to destroy her life
7018299 i have my sources and dont discuss who they are
7018300 the criminal felony invasion of her privacy and publishing her attorney client privilege is a very serious matter
7018301 our position is we are going to go forward we are preparing for trial
7018302 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
7018303 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at sen obamas campaign
7018304 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7018305 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7018306 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7018307 itll be good because you get tired of looking at an old building

7018313 i put my whole faith in you father da mien please pray for me too because i need your help

7018319 our school does its best to train them to be professional to join in the olympics
7018320 the sports schools in some ways are a metaphor for chinese culture as a whole
7018321 american athletes theres a story about some kid in the middle of idaho and they started running
7018322 in china everybody seems to have the same story they were identified when they were 4 because they had long arms or double jointed elbows and then theyre incorporated into this little system that is designed to build champions
7018323 our system is designed for the people with passion and talent but ours is a much more organic process theirs is much more centrally organized china is a country run by engineers
7018324 thats been one of the dangers of this system they are really left to their own devices without skills without an education
7018325 they are denied their childhood in pursuit of this magical goal the nation will achieve its glory by tapping them like being tapped for the armed forces
7018326 i dont think its a coincidence that in china the chinese term for a retired athlete is the same as for a retired serviceman veteran
7018327 after watching the olympics it really motivated me to come here and get better times
7018328 i kind of remembered how michael phelps did it and tried to swim like him he is just so good
7018329 we have had unprecedented interest in auditions for swim teams
7018330 we are maxed out in four of eight practice groups and we expect to fill everything
7018331 we typically enjoy a membership spike the year after every olympics
7018332 we hope that will be larger than normal because of the phelps phenomenon
7018333 what he has done is so phenomenal and the way he has done it makes his appeal universal
7018334 it was really worth it to see him break that world record
7018335 we have a black population and there are some kids who gravitate to swimming because of race and identifying with cullen
7018336 its a very sad day its a very emotional day

7018374 john mccains newfound concern for those without healthcare would be touching if he werent pushing a plan that would leave millions without insurance and raise taxes on benefits for the first time
7018375 but when a man loses track of the number of houses he owns its not surprising that hes lost touch with those who fear losing their health coverage
7018376 presidential races are close and we expect this one to be no different
7018377 but they should figure out how to spin the fact that john mccain owns a dozen houses and thinks the fundamentals of our economy are strong before trying to spin our convention
7018378 yes john mccain whats that you say hmmm thats exactly what id expect from someone who doesnt remember how many houses he owns a guy like that wouldnt know what real people are going through with foreclosure threats to their own houses the burden of health care costs and the lousy bush economy

7018393 this is not the end in any way shape or form there are many more issues to be resolved
7018394 the casinos are bad for the city and mayor nutter and gov rendell still want these things off the riverfront
7018395 were just hoping the city doesnt give us any more stumbling blocks and the permits start to go through
7018396 but were still planning on meeting with the governor and the mayor and other government officials to discuss our project
7018397 i believe that the city acted properly in revoking a license which it had no authority to have conferred
7018398 i will be taking it easy but am also excited to start writing for the fifth album
7018399 most people with allergies are atopic meaning they have a genetic tendency to develop allergies to detect the genetic factors we examined the genomes of more than 10 000 adults and children from the whole of germany
7018400 so what have you been doing the last four years
7018401 de russen stelden een ultimatum ofwel een ruil ofwel zou tbilisi aangevallen worden
7018402 i feel so blessed that they came out as good as they did
7018403 i loved the johnny cash records the edginess the rawness of them but i dont think thats glen
7018404 we went back to what glen loved and what people loved about glen i really wanted to make a record that sounded like those 60s songs
7018405 when i heard those songs for the first time they sounded hip to me and then later i noticed the lyrics were completely different i didnt realize galveston was about vietnam
7018406 i said the only idea i have is glen campbell
7018407 i picked the ones that i wanted to sing and the rest of it was a piece of cake
7018408 we are seeing applications now in 2008 going down but they are dropping less sharply and fiercely than they did in late 2001
7018409 its more of an indicator of how hard this effort is going to be
7018410 all of these people have spent 325 to file a trademark application because they think they are going to launch a product
7018411 pu venire a chiunque un portiere dalbergo o una cameriera possono avere una buona intuizione talpacreative com offre alle persona una linea diretta con il mio team di sviluppo che potrebbe trasformare il loro sogno nel nostro prossimo reality di successo
7018412 here in st petersburg anti fascists have actively helped the public prosecutors as expert witnesses since the early 1990s and have run some successful campaigns
7018413 ici saint p tersbourg les anti fascistes aident activement le procureur du minist re public l quivalent de notre procureur de la r publique comme t moins experts depuis le d but des ann es 1990 et m nent des campagnes efficaces

7018416 when i was first told how serious my cancer was my first thought was for my boys i sat there shaking thinking how on earth can i explain this to my babies then when i was told i needed an urgent hysterectomy i broke down at the thought of never having more children i have always longed for a baby girl then it hit me that some women get cancer and will never become mums i realised i should be so thankful for my gorgeous sons and decided i was going to take this horrible disease on and win
7018417 at the end of the day i am going to bloody beat this thing because ive got two amazing kids to live for and theres no way im gonna let them down
7018418 scarlett vuole che il fratello sia coinvolto nei preparativi ha dichiarato una fonte ad un quotidiano inglese ma hunter impegnato giorno e notte per questo ha deciso di rimandare il tutto a dopo le elezioni
7018419 rosalind belbens novel was innovatively plotted and convincingly executed while rosemary hills first book is a biography that does justice to the many facets of the man augustus pugin and his work
7018420 if and when we have something to announce thats when well talk about it
7018421 in philadelphia in particular location was important because it had to do with generating income
7018422 everything being equal the decisions may have come out differently
7018423 i just dont understand why the three who didnt win wouldnt seek relief allowing them to bid on the same sites
7018424 it leads to the location we had picked and thats where the project should go and it should go with some level of involvement from the original applicants from that site
7018425 it is as if sportsmen and women have a higher base level of sexual energy but why can it be that one of the underlying drivers of sporting greatness is also the very thing that produces an overactive sex drive
7018426 all the swimmers are talking about it and sullivan is cut up about what happened
7018427 i definitely admire him for his athletic ability and everything hes achieved
7018428 im just really glad to be in the mix with that
7018429 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
7018430 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
7018431 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
7018432 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
7018433 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
7018434 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in and how about the men why not bring in compulsory lycra bike pants instead of the baggy shorts many men wear currently
7018435 eww thats nasty i have never ever hooked up with michael phelps
7018436 come on i have really good taste hes really not my type we dont even talk to each other
7018437 im not dating amanda beard i think she has a boyfriend
7018438 part of my life is kept to myself im able to relax and be with my friends those pretty much are the only people who really know the answer to that
7018439 you should listen to them it would be good for you

7018441 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7018442 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7018443 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7018444 can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7018445 esperamos no estar aqu en la reuni n con spanair porque esperamos que nos entreguen los cad veres a lo largo del d a aunque si no es as iremos finalmente
7018446 no va a servir para nada porque no est en condiciones de explicar las causas del accidente
7018447 thats as fast as i could go i wish i hadnt hit the wall but i imagine it will be worse
7018448 i am so tired of hearing these ricers talk about vtec like its something special its 2008 every car normally comes with a variable valve timing they all do the same thing my car as variocam mitsus have mivec toyotas have vvtl and theres plenty more like vvl the
7018449 why should it be this is a problem that is a fijian problem
7018450 it is all the fijian political parties all the registered political parties will participate and discuss the electoral reform that has been suggested
7018451 are we going to be bullied and pressured into doing things that are clearly not in our national interest

7018457 das auto ist keineswegs immer das zweckm igste verkehrsmittel gerade bei kurzen strecken sind das fahrrad oder zu fu gehen oft besser und selbstverst ndlich billiger und auf langen strecken ist das bahnfahren oft viel erholsamer
7018458 hier geht es also darum gewohnheiten aufzubrechen und wahlfreiheit zur ckzugewinnen
7018459 das auto ist eine art verl ngertes zuhause sozusagen ein verl ngertes ich an das l sst man den anderen nicht so gerne heran
7018460 das hat nicht prim r materielle gr nde sondern spielt sich in den k pfen ab man k nnte von einer berwertigkeit des kraftfahrzeugs in bezug auf die eigene identit t sprechen die mit dem auto zu stark verbunden ist
7018461 deswegen muss man grunds tzlicher fragen wie viel mobilit t brauchen wir und ist sie vielleicht auch anders zu organisieren
7018462 dass man zum beispiel f r die benutzung von st dtischen stra en und autobahnen mit dem pkw nichts zahlen muss andere st dte im ausland haben das l ngst eingef hrt dort ist es teuer ffentlichen raum zu nutzen und die luft zu verunreinigen

7018464 jurisdiction extends to certain enumerated objects only and leaves to the several states a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects
7018465 pledged his honor that the convention at philadelphia never discovered a disposition to infringe on the government of an individual state and that in his opinion no congress on earth would dare invade the sovereignty of this commonwealth
7018466 apprehensions about article iii voiced in the state ratifying convention were said to be groundless by the advocates of the constitution and the jealousies of the members on that subject were laughed at and treated as ridiculous by rufus king and others

7018469 there has been a very small difference between mclaren ferrari and the other teams so maybe every team improved their car from the last race
7018470 and now ferrari can get a very good time on the first lap i think
7018471 both compounds are working reasonably and the lap time difference was very small because the circuit was very very dirty
7018472 i was following some cars in practice and i think there is a possibility to overtake but it will be difficult the track layout does not make things easy it is still very hard
7018473 it is very different to what we thought initially and i think overtaking chances here are very very slim
7018474 there is no real straight and you are always turning before you get to a real straight and a braking zone but its a nice layout although quite slippery off line
7018475 after the long straight following turn 12 and turn 17 they are hard braking after long straight sections so they are an opportunity but still difficult you might be able to force it before the last corner if you are lucky or even into turn 2 but it will not be easy
7018476 i like it there are a lot of slow speed corners that are tough some say they are boring but i actually enjoy them because they are all very slow and you need a lot of mechanical grip which in an f1 car is very difficult to get
7018477 the best part for me is when you come into the last corner because you have a very fast left right sequence braking down while you are still turning right and then you go left into the corner
7018478 to be honest the conclusion was that nobody was prepared to discuss much because we are finalising the fota area
7018479 part of the discussion was how to ensure we retain some of the smaller teams but nobody at this stage wanted to get involved in the discussion because fota has a role in that activity
7018480 we are finalising the concorde agreement and we want to make some amendments to secure the future of all teams so we said to bernie look lets wait
7018481 the key point really is one of the issues discussed during fota discussions was how do we achieve the fine balance of securing the future of small teams but also satisfying the needs of manufacturers and maintaining somehow the dna of f1
7018482 i hope there will be a team by 2012 it will be team uk i hope we can get an agreement on that
7018483 britain is the home of football which we gave to the world and people will be surprised if there is an olympic tournament in football and we are not part of it

7018568 baptism is the sacrament of regeneration through water and in the word
7018569 born with a fallen human nature and tainted by original sin children also have need of the new birth in baptism to be freed from the power of darkness and brought into the realm of the freedom of the children of god to which all men are called 50 the sheer gratuitousness of the grace of salvation is particularly manifest in infant baptism the church and the parents would deny a child the priceless grace of becoming a child of god were they not to confer baptism shortly after birth

7018594 the biggest worries schools have are hackers getting into the web site
7018595 obviously being interested in computers i asked the student what he was working on the kid replied that he was hacking into the finance office computer so he could mark his tuition account as paid
7018596 its a nightmare the new web 2 0 apps are giving students more ways to get in
7018597 part of the challenge is that the kids in one school will take down the networks of other schools its like having a snow day to them schools have become so dependent on technology to run the office and deliver instruction in the classroom taking down the networks is equivalent to removing the cash registers from wal marts without the technology people cant function
7018598 these include the introduction of malware the need for effective gateway controls and bandwidth consumption we are seeing a significant increase in web 2 0 coming into the schools these new uses are straining all hardware with bottlenecks the peaks in demand raise concerns that school networks cannot handle the traffic schools have to re evaluate their networks
7018599 all of this we didnt traditionally let them do because of security and bandwidth concerns
7018600 weve had to relax our posture to let them all have access this presents us with an interesting challenge i cant say no anymore
7018601 at this point the sense we get from school it administrators is they are constantly fighting bandwidth
7018602 the growing issue is what should it managers do with smartphone and related devices
7018603 when these devices are used it doesnt know it is happening it presents new issues to us these devices can be lost and other users have more readily available access the smartphone has become a us 79 laptop
7018604 we need to push teachers to use educationally sound web sites rather than blogging sites
7018605 it is very difficult to separate the good from the bad on these popular general use web sites
7018606 teachers dont realize that ultimately the school district is responsible for any abuses that occur teachers have to share that responsibility for what their students access in school
7018607 schools have to be current with their use of security technology one of the biggest mistakes it people at schools make is putting all their security on the perimeter over the last few years we are seeing spikes inside the networks now it has to harden the network data center even from its own users
7018608 non escludo di andare avanti fino a londra per me i giochi e le medaglie sono come quando partorisci maledici il dolore ma poi vorresti un altro bambino spero di aver regalato agli italiani una bella emozione

7018626 bens chili bowl epitomizes what this great city is all about
7018627 the biggest problem is anxiety by the home fans bayern are regarded as favourites so we need every man woman and child to take account of this and back the team
7018628 we have every opportunity to sit together over a coffee or have some fun were more like a family in the past we just used to train shower and go home
7018629 he should be able to begin a little light jogging at the weekend
7018630 in the past we have often made a good impression against bremen in six previous games we beat them four times and drew twice
7018631 real madrid would never retain a player on the team against his wishes and would have no choice but to call for a unilateral resolution of the contract if the player willed it so
7018632 given the high personal and professional esteem that the club has always held the player in as he deserves
7018633 openly and publicly and before divers assemblages of citizens of the united states make and declare with a loud voice certain intemperate inflammatory and scandalous harangue amid the cries jeers and laughter of the multitudes then assembled in hearing
7018634 the influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular states
7018635 but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other states
7018636 it isnt that other plants cant grow as well its just that poison ivy grows so much more
7018637 its going to be like a one two punch more poison ivy and more poisonous poison ivy
7018638 it took me three weeks to get over it the rash got infected i can send you pictures
7018639 current increase in global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations bears consequences for human health on a panoptic scale
7018640 you want to see poison ivy cmon over ill show you poison ivy
7018641 i really do think that vines are growing a heck of a lot more crazily than they were 20 years ago
7018642 and this year with all the rain well everything loves the rain just walking around ive seen very healthy colonies of poison ivy
7018643 can be in a small cluster or in upright bush form
7018644 people have to recognize that something we find not very useful has value in the world
7018645 aside from just the fact there might be a lot of birds and critters that can consume the berries and deer that eat the foliage these are carbon sinks these are actually taking up carbon
7018646 at this point there are two things awareness and education
7018647 when you do come in contact with it wash it off as soon as possible
7018648 more than enough food is produced to feed a healthy global population distribution and access to food is a problem many are hungry while at the same time many overeat
7018649 we are providing food to take care of not only our necessary consumption but also our wasteful habits
7018650 as much as half of the water used to grow food globally may be lost or wasted
7018651 curbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win win opportunities for farmers business ecosystems and the global hungry
7018652 an effective water saving strategy requires that minimizing food wastage is firmly placed on the political agenda
7018653 thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion liters of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
7018654 saving water from field to fork curbing losses and wastage in the food chain
7018655 unless we change our practices water will be a key constraint to food production in the future
7018656 people toss the food they buy and all the resources used to grow ship and produce the food along with it
7018657 improving water productivity and reducing the quantity of food that is wasted can enable us to provide a better diet for the poor and enough food for growing populations
7018658 reaching the target we propose a 50 percent reduction of losses and wastage in the production and consumption chain is a necessary and achievable goal
7018659 saving water from field to fork curbing losses and wastage in the food chain
7018660 the improved understanding of trade and water management issues on local regional and global scales are of the highest relevance for the successful and sustainable use of water resources
7018661 all we are asking is that we slow down to make sure these projects dont do irreparable harm to our shrinking desert
7018662 the southwest is not a big flat empty parking lot
7018663 we cant push this off for 10 20 or 30 years
7018664 is the wrong signal to send to solar power developers and to nevadans and westerners who need and want clean affordable sun powered electricity soon
7018665 you have folks who have been at war for decades who are saying wait a minute
7018666 you have the ohvers and sierra clubbers on kind of the same page
7018667 until the technology changes and they can put the solar collectors into the rocks and cliffs it will impact desert tortoise
7018668 that will be a huge issue itself determining how much impact we can tolerate to these desert species
7018669 we need renewable energy but we also need healthy lands
7018670 you are talking about hundreds and thousands of drilling pads in wyoming and colorado and elsewhere we are talking about dozens of solar projects at most that i expect to see at the end of this process
7018671 solar utilities need certainty wind developers coal nuclear you name it they all want certainty in their planning and regulatory process and at the end of the day i think the peis process will provide even greater certainty
7018672 we will have to make compromises like putting wind turbines in beautiful places
7018673 real madrid would never want to retain a player against his wishes and as a result they have no alternative but to accept his unilateral decision to rescind his contract if that is what the player wants
7018674 no player will be kept here against their will this does not mean that madrid will not defend the interests of the club
7018675 im sure that robinho has already weighed up the consequences of his decision and im sure that in the next few days he will give a letter to the club to announce that he wants to go
7018676 i can tell you that madrid are not going to transfer robinho we are not going to sell him if he wants to go then he should go now
7018677 its not necessarily that he will have to pay the 150million euros buyout clause he would end his contract but the courts will decide what he has to pay
7018678 fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me
7018679 because we have been othered we must now learn once more how to be ourselves
7018680 s ince narcissism had no discernable effect on level of performance in the highly dynamic industries we studied we might reasonably expect that it would have a more negative effect in more stable settings
7018681 by the same token that the bearer hereof satt up with you last night i hereby order you to give him as many kisses and as many hours of your company after 9 o clock as he shall please to demand and charge them to my account
7018682 that unabated affection which has for years past and will whilst the vital spark lasts burn in the bosom of your affectionate a adams
7018683 is there no way for two friendly souls to converse together altho the bodies are 400 miles off yes by letter but i want a better communication i want to hear you think or see your thoughts the conclusion of your letter makes my heart throb more than a cannonade would you bid me burn your letters but i must forget you first
7018684 how much female education is neglected tho i acknowled it my happiness to be connected with a person of a more generous mind and liberal sentiments
7018685 students detect that their teachers find it very hard to objectively mark an essay defending the war in iraq on its merits
7018686 the teaching evaluations for courses in my university are made public

7018692 probably the best thing is we didnt get anybody hurt and well reload next week weve got to improve in every facet of the game we never could get into a rhythm all game
7018693 its just one game and weve got a lot more to play

7018696 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
7018697 celebrities like lindsay lohan are merely gay for play and are attempting to cash in on the faddish appeal of lesbianism without any commitment to our cause
7018698 they never seem to move past the hand holding and eye gazing phase of the relationship
7018699 theres no sense these two are actually in a commited relationship if lindsay would come out and say shes gay and in a commited relationship with ronson then maybe she could use her media clout for good for the first time in her life
7018700 its the year of i kissed a girl for lohan and lots of other chicks out there when ronson dumps her shell just pick up the pieces and date a man
7018701 that kid got half a game last season as a junior varsity player
7018702 he grew up a little bit tonight he came to the party he was a little shaky at first but he was great after that

7018704 we expect him back full for east carolina on aug 30
7018705 i felt my blockers and i took it to the house
7018706 thats the joy of the game some teams are unrealistic but a lot of winning confidence thats what makes it fun
7018707 its worse than christmas morning i can guarantee you that none of my seniors have slept much this week
7018708 did i prepare them enough is there anything else i could have done are my players ready
7018709 theres a lot of anxiety but im 50 50 they just have to get out there and get that first snap now its time you get to test your mettle
7018710 i just had a feeling if we just didnt quit we could pull out a few more plays than snow canyon
7018711 but that was a crazy ugly remarkable game ugly times two actually
7018712 the knights brought it up before the game that our season ended on this field in that end zone on the last play of the game last year
7018713 it was just one of those games the team who had the ball
7018714 when i was told id be the starting quarterback in training camp i was nervous but i wasnt nervous
7018715 to me fowlers just our quarterback he did some good things out there and well take it
7018716 i was pleased how the offense kept our defense off the field
7018717 hinds was sick and then dealt with a hip injury heading into this game so i thought he played really well he definitely took a lot of pressure off of me
7018718 we need to get better in a lot of areas

7018780 extraction of the grounds of a divine ruling an obvious example would be that the grounds for the prohibition of
7018781 of a divine ruling quran sunna and consensus with the exception of the quran the different mujtahids had different opinions with regard to the manner in which the other two
7018782 a common example of a sabab is the sun reaching its zenith in the sky being the condition for the obligation to pray
7018783 the other position adopted by the shafiis at least according to al qarafi is that each town has its own moon i
7018784 fast at its sighting and cease fasting at its sighting
7018785 every mujtahid is correct according to one of the two views on the issue
7018786 whoever of you sees wrongdoing let him change it with his hand if he cannot then with his tongue if he cannot then with his heart and that is the weakest belief

7018815 too many software projects rely on only one or a very few team members who know how to build and assemble the final released product
7018816 such knowledge centralisation not only creates engineering redundancy issues but it also endangers gpl compliance which requires you to provide build scripts
7018817 it will take parliament 10 minutes to pass a resolution for reinstatement of deposed judges after which an executive order should be issued by the prime minister in the evening
7018818 we have asked ppp to inform us by saturday night whether the judges will be reinstated by monday
7018819 this seizure underlines the excellent cooperation between all our partners in the region and once again confirms the importance of our presence in the caribbean
7018820 radical terrorist groups in the border regions have undermined and fought against the central government of pakistan and carved out sanctuaries and training bases
7018821 they have come back and they are presenting a significant challenge
7018822 at least 70 innocent civilians most of them women and children
7018823 we stand by our account and our reports and what we know and i cant reconcile why the interior ministry would have a different figure
7018824 all allegations of civilian casualties are taken very seriously coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives
7018825 my suspicion is considering what these men have been through there is probably not a whole lot in this world they do fear
7018826 sir at this time id like to plead the fifth amendment
7018827 the government is extremely concerned about the fraud that is being put before the jury
7018828 this court is once again calling on his honor and integrity
7018829 go to the attic and check your suitcase for the razor
7018830 sakhian is a great start to the edinburgh mela as it lets women across the generations enjoy a night out together
7018831 with the addition of musical drama performed by members of the local community the ladies night is also a valuable opportunity to showcase home grown talent this year some professional performers will also be taking part in the sakhian night
7018832 extending the mela to a full week and moving to the new leith site has enabled us to showcase many more acts than in previous years whether you are looking for a lively night out with friends family fun or the latest up and coming artists from around the world the mela is sure to please
7018833 there goes my season looks like i have to settle for 10 goals this year
7018834 dont speak too soon man we never know what will happen lets just pray we do meet ramadhan
7018835 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
7018836 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
7018837 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7018838 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7018839 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7018840 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7018841 i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the pre aug 7 position as agreed
7018842 wir sind eine arbeitnehmerpartei und daher geh rt die gewerkschaft zu uns wir sind eine familie
7018843 wir sollten m glichst m ige lohnverhandlungen machen und gegen die teuerung f llt ihm nichts ein
7018844 die sollen verdienen aber es sollen alle menschen etwas davon haben denn wenn es der wirtschaft gut geht soll es allen gut gehen
7018845 die haben sich get uscht wir stehen auf beiden f en
7018846 die haben gleich ein fest gefeiert deshalb sage ich euch wer zuletzt feiert der feiert am besten
7018847 man hat mir gesagt dass ihr hier in k rnten schon einen vorsitzenden abgew hlt habt weil er zu lange geredet hat deshalb fasse ich mich kurz
7018848 meilenstein auf dem weg der gro artigen wiedererstarkung der chinesischen nation
7018849 das chinesische volk kann jetzt stolz der welt verk nden wir haben das vertrauen der internationalen gemeinschaft und des internationalen olympischen komitees erf llt
7018850 gleichzeitig kann die welt mit genugtuung sagen wir haben die richtige entscheidung getroffen indem wir peking und china als olympia gastgeber gew hlt haben
7018851 die gro en errungenschaften chinas nach drei jahrzehnten reform und ffnung wiedergespiegelt
7018852 die austragung dieser spiele hat das selbstvertrauen der menschen gest rkt die nationale einheit gef rdert und das vertrauen des landes gest rkt eine friedliche entwicklung zu verfolgen
7018853 das st ndig fortschritte macht freundschaft und harmonie betont seine versprechen h lt und alle internationalen regeln befolgt
7018854 would be completely incompatible with life even incompatible with breathing
7018855 while marcela was alive her pediatrician affirmed that the child is very active recognizes her mother and cries when she isnt in her arms
7018856 marcela is a clear example that a child even with such a deformity is a human being and as such deserves care and respect
7018857 even though anencephaly is listed as a lethal congenital illness with a short lifespan the fetuses that are afflicted with this disease must have their rights respected
7018858 life must be protected as a gift and an obligation even when its course is presumed to be brief there is an enormous ethical moral and spiritual difference between natural death and a death that is provoked the commandment applies here thou shalt not kill ex 20 13
7018859 a happy ending that a catholic university was willing to stand up for catholic rights
7018860 unfortunate but hopefully in the future people will do their homework a little better she was very public about her positions
7018861 any appeal to the principle of academic freedom in order to justify positions that contradict the faith and the teaching of the church would obstruct or even betray the universitys identity and mission
7018862 on behalf of our 20 000 plus member base dedicated to the renewal of catholic higher education the cardinal newman society publicly supports the resolve of the university of san diego administration to not re extend the offer to ruether
7018863 when we show our body without prudence without modesty we are prostituting ourselves
7018864 we have observed these abuses the festival will be used to correct these abuses observed in the way our female members dress some songs that our choirs sing and in the celebration mass some bishops have frowned at these things and have decided that we should find a way of addressing the issues
7018865 let not the gospel on being introduced into any new land destroy or extinguish whatever its people possess that is naturally good just or beautiful for the church when she calls a person to higher culture and better way of life under the inspiration of the christian religion does not act like one who recklessly cuts down and uproots a thriving forest
7018866 this is another opportunity for us as joint stakeholders in nation building to collaborate and ensure the success of the festival in question
7018867 it will not only bring out cultural features and arts that can be of liturgical benefit to the catholic church but also showcase the moral values of our culture and people to the world
7018868 quella di avere una banca propria sempre stata tra le aspirazioni pi forti dei cooperatori si trattava di rendersi autonomi nei confronti di un contesto finanziario e creditizio tutto sommato ostile
7018869 lantagonismo che ha animato a lungo la cooperazione nei confronti dei ceti di governo e quindi lostilit politica contro di essa
7018870 che molto cambiato e la gente per fortuna si accorta di tutto
7018871 the team continues the final fit out of the boat as it prepares for some preliminary sea trials here next month
7018872 das sind die spiele der athleten sie haben starke leistungen gezeigt wir haben 36 weltrekorde gesehen wir haben mit usain bolt einen neuen star wir haben michael phelps aber auch einige unbekannte olympiasieger wie man zhong im fechten das macht die spiele aus
7018873 sie hat aus ihrer ersten suspendierung nichts gelernt sie ist nun lebenslang gesperrt und hat sich damit selbst ausgeschlossen damit diese dinge nicht mehr passieren haben wir eine neue regel eingef hrt jeder der l nger als sechs monate gesperrt ist darf nicht mehr bei olympia starten diese regel greift aber erst nach den spielen in peking und nicht r ckwirkend f r dinge die vor den spielen in peking passiert sind
7018874 am anfang der spiele hatten wir leere sitze das ist wahr
7018875 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7018876 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7018877 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7018878 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7018879 can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7018880 they didnt live without each other and they died together cradle to grave
7018881 what we do know from several witnesses is this vehicle was passing another vehicle and as it was returning to its lane it lost control went off the road and struck the tree
7018882 i came running outside and saw all the neighbors running
7018883 if it was my kid i would hope someone would have done that
7018884 my heart goes out to the parents i cant imagine
7018885 you cant just talk about one of them it was always mark and tom
7018886 they always said their legs were worth a million dollars
7018887 punting wise i worked on my technique shortened my strides up and punting through the ball
7018888 my first two years i was overstriding a lot trying to overpower the ball but i learned that it was form and my leg will take care of the power so i shortened my strides up
7018889 i dont want any ups and downs keep going up with every game
7018890 its a lighter ball so it helps you get up and through it more
7018891 for me personally i would kick the ball and my leg would come straight back down i hit this and my leg goes up and keeps going up so i get more hang time and a solid hit
7018892 were kind of in a situation without naming names where in the next days were probably going to determine eight to 10 freshmen who have an opportunity first of all play some position be in some role be some sort of backup or starter on our team
7018893 once thats determined and theres still competition at some of those positions then we determine hey if these guys are backup players then were probably going to go ahead and play them on special teams
7018894 with this team were going to have to make that determination as if were cutting our team like an nfl squad were going to keep these guys and were going to play them this year then lets go ahead and play them i dont feel like we have enough depth on our team if we play these guys they might make some mistakes early but in the long run i think it will make us a better team
7018895 the offseason was the best yet for me personally and the team
7018896 if he keeps working like he has id like to think hell make a contribution at some time during the season
7018897 no lo veo sinceramente como un inconveniente hoy para nosotros para nada todo lo contrario
7018898 i thought using a little bit here and there is tacky so weve had all switzerland working on couture lace theyre in shock
7018899 when you are working on something simple the surface is important i wanted to do minimal something that was feminine and strong but in the end not so sexy and there are a lot of references to early nineties prada in there
7018900 when people speak of great men they think of men like napoleon men of violence
7018901 what dreams do the men of violence have at night and what dreams do the great men of peace have at night william wilberforce tormented by his destiny eventually slept with a clean conscience and with his own peace
7018902 it came out of a strategic review document that came out of the cfia and my department last fall
7018903 there are no cuts no changes anticipated other than doing a better job with the resources that we have
7018904 the same people who are responsible for what happened in walkerton
7018905 when we got up to eight or nine in the later part of july thats when we started asking health units could you go back and get us some more information
7018906 theres been some sort of failure to communicate in a timely manner so that the public could be made aware so that we could make the choices to make ourselves safe
7018907 we have about 80 employees working 24 hours a day under the supervision of a microbiologist and a sanitation expert to do three complete cycles of sanitation
7018908 ritz said the document was outdated and never went forward he said the government has actually gone the opposite way of whats alleged theyve added 200 plus inspectors and another 113 million into product safety and recall powers for health canada
7018909 finance minister jim flaherty environment minister john baird and health minister tony clement as the same people
7018910 we knew coming in that we may never have this experience again so we are lucky that everything went well and we got what we wanted
7018911 i think he has played very well in the olympic tournament
7018912 hes played very well today as he normally does in his position and i knew that he could probably be the deciding factor
7018913 i think it the game had been played in another part of the day it would have been very different
7018914 we tried to make sure that we didnt get uptight just too play our own game
7018915 we wanted to play with intelligence and move the ball around and not run around so much we wanted the ball to do the work
7018916 there should be a level playing field its unfair to allow unrestricted internet telephony to isps at no additional cost
7018917 the government has been pushing reforms in telecoms i think theyll give it the green light
7018918 in other words an increase in the isps business will also result in a boom for existing telcos given this scenario the government would do well to accept the regulators recommendations
7018919 il est normal que ce drame suscite autant d motion mais cest aussi parce quil nous rappelle que le fait denvoyer des militaires l tranger comporte des risques et quil faut les assumer

7018925 we have high quality products to sell at low cost to compete with biolase but have been limited in our ability to provide these products to dentists because of the actions alleged in the complaint
7018926 we reluctantly brought this case because these actions have caused significant harm to nlt and to dentists

7018948 the rebate if translated will cost between 35 sen and 40 sen a litre if the people do not appreciate the rebates it is better for us not issue any more in the future
7018949 it is better for us to transfer the allocation for the rebate to reduce the fuel price
7018950 however we do not resort to such measure because if we transfer to pump prices people driving big cars such as bentley jaguar and bmw 7 series will also enjoy the subsidies

7018991 le ragazze hanno appena finito un allenamento le ho viste molto bene devo dire che anche ieri sera subito dopo la fine della gara la loro voglia era di ritornare comunque subito in palestra a riallenarsi a riprovare lesercizio con le 5 funi e poi quello coi cerchi anche se avevano appena terminato la gara la condizione buona e il morale devo dire che buono hanno voglia di ritornare in pedana e di far vedere ancora una volta quello che sanno fare

7019001 why choose a man who has publicly and repeatedly lambasted the democratic candidates political inexperience
7019002 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7019003 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7019004 i hated the gooks i will hate them as long as i live
7019005 probably the best thing is we didnt get anybody hurt and well reload next week weve got to improve in every facet of the game we never could get into a rhythm all game
7019006 its just one game and weve got a lot more to play
7019007 the takeaways just gave us a great opportunity to keep them out of the end zone it was a great way for us to come in and win here its been a big roller coaster week for us
7019008 the knights brought it up before the game that our season ended on this field in that end zone on the last play of the game last year
7019009 it was just one of those games the team who had the ball
7019010 we wanted to score fast and early last year they beat us on our turf but we came out and got them this time
7019011 i just had a feeling if we just didnt quit we could pull out a few more plays than snow canyon
7019012 but that was a crazy ugly remarkable game ugly times two actually
7019013 i felt my blockers and i took it to the house
7019014 thats the joy of the game some teams are unrealistic but a lot of winning confidence thats what makes it fun
7019015 its worse than christmas morning i can guarantee you that none of my seniors have slept much this week
7019016 did i prepare them enough is there anything else i could have done are my players ready
7019017 theres a lot of anxiety but im 50 50 they just have to get out there and get that first snap now its time you get to test your mettle
7019018 just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
7019019 people think chace is gay and thought i was gay that we were humping its not true but hilarious people project their fantasies onto people ive never been someone who makes it my objective to go out and pick up chicks but ive met some fantastic ladies here you know those amazing conversations where you find yourself in a caf talking until 2 a m and never see them again
7019020 that kid got half a game last season as a junior varsity player
7019021 he grew up a little bit tonight he came to the party he was a little shaky at first but he was great after that
7019022 when i was told id be the starting quarterback in training camp i was nervous but i wasnt nervous
7019023 to me fowlers just our quarterback he did some good things out there and well take it
7019024 i was pleased how the offense kept our defense off the field
7019025 hinds was sick and then dealt with a hip injury heading into this game so i thought he played really well he definitely took a lot of pressure off of me

7019029 i think adam wins that race 364 days of the year
7019030 hes my great friend so emotionally i tried to ignore it but it was hard to do
7019031 its a reminder to everybody who goes to the olympics that you have to be ready at that day and that time and at every point of the race
7019032 it isnt always the favourite who wins competition brings out the best in some people and the pressure sometimes puts people back
7019033 we chatted with him briefly and hes trying to figure it out
7019034 hes a competitor and he wants the best out of himself and he was ready to do that when it doesnt happen you second guess yourself and you renew it
7019035 i was looking at the flag and hoping that next time it will be in the middle and ill have the medal i want
7019036 im not going to go up there and start screaming and crying like a child
7019037 obviously i would have liked to hear the canadian anthem but it didnt happen i won silver and i hope that canada is proud of me i did part of this for them
7019038 im happy i have a medal its not the one i want but im still happy you have to learn how to lose thats how you grow and how you learn to do better the next time
7019039 it is a start but im very competitive when i want something i usually get it so im disappointed because i want my gold medal
7019040 its not because i couldnt get it it was right there its just a question of a little more training in various aspects and ill get it next time
7019041 they work hard and the program is very important to them
7019042 its like hockey for us but like you see were not bad also
7019043 to the best of my knowledge there wasnt any indication about this facility having any problem whatsoever until we started getting information from the public health network

7019064 friday 15th jamadi ul awwal the sacred dead body of the traveller to the kingdom of holiness hazrat mumtaz ul zamani who was buried temporarily was brought to the capital akbarabad agra
7019065 although raja jaisingh valued it greatly as his ancestral heritage and property yet would have been agreeable to part with it gratis for the emperor shahjahan
7019066 next year that illustrious body of the heavenly queen was laid to rest the officials of the capital according to the royal orders of the day under the sky high lofty mausoleum hid the pious lady from the eyes of the world and the edifice so majestic and with a dome and so lofty in its stature is a memorial to the courage of sky dimensions of the king and a strength so mighty in resolution so firm the foundation was laid and geomatricians of farsight and architects of talent incurred an expenditure of rs 40 lakhs chihal lakh roopiah on this building
7019067 palace of raja mansingh was selected for the burial of the queen
7019068 another item of evidence concerning the alleged date of the taj is adduced from a radiocarbon date from a piece of wood from a door on the north facade of the jumuna rivers bank the sample was tested by dr even williams director of the brooklyn college radiocarbon laboratory the date came to 1359 ad with a spread of 89 years on either side and 67 probability masca corrected
7019069 i ordered that all the artisans and clever mechanics who were masters of their respective crafts should be picked out from among the prisoners and set aside and accordingly some thousands of craftsmen were selected to await my command all these i distributed among the princes and amirs who were present or who were engaged officially in other parts of my dominions i had determined to build a masjid i jami in samarkhand the seat of my empire which should be without a rival in my country so i ordered that all builders and stone masons should be set apart for my own especial service
7019070 so far as can be made out most of these temples date from 16 though a few of them may be older their original foundation may be earlier but of that we know nothing no one having yet enlightened us on the subject nor explained how and when this hill became a sacred mount
7019071 the arrangement of the roofing of the mausoleum itself consists of five domes this structural arrangement is not saracenic but essentially hindu it is known in hindu architecture as the
7019072 by the ninth century they muslims were able to calculate the direction of mecca within two degrees from any city the mosque that is part of the taj complex faces due west whereas mecca from agra is 14 degrees 55 minutes south of west
7019073 minarets so far as i know were not attached to mosques during the so called pathan period the call to prayer was made from the roof and except the first rude attempt at ajmer i do not know an instance of a minaret built solely for such a purpose though they were as we know universal in egypt and elsewhere long before this time and were considered nearly indispensable in the buildings of the mughals very shortly afterwards
7019074 the location of the minarets over the parapets flanking the main entrance is to say the least unusual and a clear case of fortuitous addition rather than comprehensive design these minarets were certainly built either as experiments before erecting those at the taj or immediately thereafter more probably the latter
7019075 it has been brought to the notice of his majesty that during the late region many idol temples had begun but remained unfinished at benaras the great stronghold of infidelity the infidels were now desirous of completing them his majesty the defender of the faith gave orders that at benaras and throughout all his dominions at every place all temples should be cast down it was now reported from the province of allahabad that 76 temples had been destroyed in the district of benaras
7019076 it would be difficult to point out in the whole history of architecture any change so sudden as that which took place between the style of akbar and that of his grandson shah jahan nor any contrast so great as that between the manly vigour and exuberant originality of the first as compared with the extreme but almost effeminate elegance of the second certainly when the same people following the same religion built temples and palaces in the same locality nothing of the sort ever occurred in any country whose history is known to us
7019077 hemos esperado mucho este momento y por fin ha llegado

7019079 the once every four years hope for the lever pull sensation of democratic power blinds people to the opportunities for democratic representation deliberation activism and change that surrounds us in local elections

7019089 being able to free ski and train in the wave track provided a great opportunity for our athletes to enhance their ability to read and adapt to varying terrain
7019090 brad alire and nascs support allowed our athletes to experience terrain they dont often have exposure to and we are grateful for this
7019091 our team was able to have high quality training for two weeks steve cruz and his staff have done a wonderful job preparing the training arenas for us as always

7019098 nadie duda de la necesidad econ mica que tienen hoy las municipalidades pero la llegada de fondos s lo ser para aquellos que deroguen las tasas de abasto y publicidad interior es decir para aquellos que resignen parte de su autonom a en la prestaci n de servicios y su correspondiente cobro de la tasa
7019099 en principio se debe discutir qu significa la coparticipaci n federal
7019100 la responsabilidad viene de a os de un gobierno que maneja la provincia casualmente es el mismo partido
7019101 nos parece absolutamente criterioso los del interior no tienen la densidad ni los problemas del conurbano y no necesitan asistencia de la provincia

7019103 our wide receiver position is kind of odd when you consider getting down to 53 so it made me look at the third game differently than i have in the past
7019104 in the past i always wanted the starters to come out in the third quarter thats not the case this time it could happen with a few guys but thats not the purpose of the third game this time
7019105 its norway on the pacific norwegians should design wind farms and plan the health care system but they may not roast people at the friars club
7019106 who chairs the city councils committee on planning land use and neighborhoods
7019107 at these prices theyre probably not billionaires when they leave
7019108 take the highly simplified case where a person has exactly 1 billion invested in tax free municipal bonds at 5 percent at this rate he earns 5 708 per hour and would have to consume 408 martinis in one hour to no longer be a billionaire
7019109 you could argue that he would incur other expenses at the same time but even if these expenses consumed 90 percent of his income it would still take 41 martinis to place him below the threshold and remember most billionaires have more than 1 billion to start with
7019110 in fact given the earning power described above it is much more likely that a non billionaire becomes a billionaire while consuming a 14 martini than the reverse

7019117 no ha sido el d a ven a a luchar por la medalla de oro y no he estado a un gran nivel sobre todo en la salida eso ha sido crucial me han cerrado y he perdido unas cuantas plazas el esfuerzo para recuperarlas ha sido clave
7019118 esto demuestra que para luchar en unos juegos hay que estar desde el principio adelante
7019119 pero he aguantado un poco pensando en los valores de los juegos la lucha el sacrificio aguantar el tipo el juego limpio lo m s importante son las medallas pero me he mantenido por los valores ol mpicos

7019131 but what kickball lacks in marketing it makes up for with a decided lack of humiliation in front of your superior peers

7019133 i will take a decision after talking to ministers who won the elections as independent in ranchi
7019134 i will announce my decision anyhow today either in the evening or at night
7019135 it is not a personal issue that i alone can make a decision all the independents will be taken into confidence before taking a final decision
7019136 when the upa government was formed earlier in jharkhand independents were first taken into confidence this time it was just opposite
7019137 no proposal for a better leadership was put before us or there were no convincing arguments given here as to why a change of leadership in required in jharkhand at all
7019138 ich f hle mich gerade etwas hilflos nach dieser siegesserie muss man das erstmal verdauen

7019140 its a fine morning for a ride or it would be if the land wasnt marked like this
7019141 all morning weve been riding and all weve seen is charred earth tumbled fences battered walls your field here is the first thing weve come across thats relatively intact so we stopped what happened here
7019142 i am sir brandon i hail from parts north this is sir lamarcus from the south and east
7019143 if youre from the north and you from the south and east how did you end up traveling together
7019144 ive been around long enough to know that fortunate drafts are seldom the result of mere chance
7019145 however that may be chance is how we see it if you see something else perhaps you are wiser
7019146 look around you does a wise man dig holes in fields like this
7019147 this was once a noble town a noble land in those days it was fair we didnt always have everything our way but our men were strong and fought well our people were proud and graceful we were respected even by enemy soldiers and their people win or lose no matter what the day brought every man woman and child could hold their head high then it all changed
7019148 i dont know exactly how it happened i dont suppose anyone knows some say corruption came from the top maybe the people had it so good for so long they stopped paying attention or maybe they became more concerned about winning the battle than fighting it well or than what they were fighting to preserve either way the result was the same we started weakening nobody made progress the leaders stood up and told us we needed better men that the old ways werent good enough so they started hiring mercenaries
7019149 sure they fought for a while everything seemed fine but they always seemed to cost a little more than they gave we brought in more and more of them and trained up fewer and fewer of the old style men then little by little we started losing the leaders didnt care they were getting rich off of the taxes they raised to pay for the mercenaries finally when it became apparent to even the dullest fool that the money was going to run dry and we couldnt win a battle if our lives depended on it they left the mercenaries the leaders all of them but they didnt leave empty handed oh no they took everything they could lay their hands on the heritage the pride the chance to be something everything theyd have taken the whole town if they could it didnt do any good they just laughed and told us it was necessary nobody believed it but it was too late by then most of the folks just drifted off after that nobody to repair the barns nobody to mend the fences no children laughing no fire in the hearth nobody wanting to remember much just scarred ground and silence look around you no enemy did this to us we did it to ourselves
7019150 alright farmer but one more question what are you going to do when enemies come again
7019151 i suppose ill just knock back as many as i can before they bowl me over or until they stop coming
7019152 if everybody here is like you i think we might take a liking to this land as well
7019153 i dont supposed trained is what youd call it there are a couple of youngsters who have been fooling around for a while they think theyre pretty good i wouldnt give them much chance in a real fight though if you go to town you cant miss them
7019154 i wonder if theres any chance of getting something decent to eat here
7019155 i would stop right there if you mean this town any harm
7019156 my friend there knows how to use his weapon and mine would fell you before you drew that sword at your side
7019157 we mean you no harm nor your town in fact i think we were looking for you
7019158 yes a farmer outside of town said we might find youths in here who had some skill with weapons
7019159 you have enough quickness and ive never seen leaps like you perform but the gods only know how youve managed to get this far without slicing off your own feet the way you wave that thing around when you tumble
7019160 yes i believe so with a little proper training he may be more than that
7019161 i can see long distance shooting will be your specialty what other means of attack are you good at
7019162 dont overextend yourself dont waste motion but there when you see an opening take it take it
7019163 well i have to say that you look pretty impressive it was more than i thought you would do but theres still a problem i dont think all the practice in the world is going to get you around
7019164 yes indeed potions curatives pastimes and entertainments all rolled into one thats what youre about to see good people you have never laid your eyes on something so mystical so magical so splendiferous in so many ways as the chan man
7019165 ah obviously fine men in impeccable shape you surely do not have need of my potions and curatives but take heed all of you the miracles i carry can make you as fit and strong as these and then some a little perseverance and a spoonful of belief is all it takes but you three you would certainly be more interested in my pastimes riddles to confound the mind and puzzles to confound the fingers and common sense alike games that your children will never tire of and smells that your wives will love no well perhaps you enjoy juggling then
7019166 well now that depends on the meaning of your question i suppose
7019167 then perhaps we can discuss this under more private circumstances
7019168 no no good people there will be plenty of potions and curatives and entertainments to be had later for now we must obtain the blessing of your town leaders
7019169 gentlemen surely my welcome can not be as worn as all that yet
7019170 no not at all you simply find us at a difficult time the campaigning season is soon upon us and we havent enough men to properly defend this town a little levity would be useful to take the peoples minds off of their troubles but a good sword would be even more useful
7019171 well now i have told you i am a buffet of goodness have i not i do not swing a sword that well but there are many ways of accomplishing the same goals
7019172 what is your price to join us we have not had good fortune with hired hands
7019173 price not all the money in the world would do i fear i can make all the money i need plying my trade
7019174 respect respect and the chance to be myself so many look at me with distaste and mistrust even those who enjoy me eventually want to change me to force me into being something im not i just want a place that accepts me that i can call my own
7019175 i cannot believe that you are thinking of accepting this man into our fine fellowship
7019176 i am sergio sometimes known as il mago i have great and wonderful powers unlike this charlatan and purveyor of trinkets
7019177 not that i should have to prove myself to you but yes
7019178 well yes my powers are not full grown yet but when they are full grown i will be a great and mighty wizard far more suited to your company of defenders than this phony
7019179 perhaps we can use him in some kind of support role
7019180 we have reached our decision since the matter of which of you is the greater is as yet unsettled we are forced to retain both of you in our company let no man say different until we ourselves have made our judgment
7019181 even with our company so strengthened we lack two things one of those sir lamarcus and i will attend to shortly the second is more difficult we have many fine fighte uhhh we have many fighters but we have nobody to organize us we need someone with a brain for battle for logistics and accounting and all the little things that keep an army running smoothly do you know anyone who fits the bill
7019182 there used to be a man like that around here
7019183 what in the name of bonnies beautiful blintzes is that
7019184 its not a creature its a giant and yes i know him or at least sir lamarcus and i know of him we heard he was in these parts and we sent out a message saying he would be welcome in our town
7019185 just a moment please sir giant we must simply prepare for your arrival
7019186 why in the world would we want a giant in our town
7019187 if its fighting men you want i believe i have found one which will be suitable
7019188 hey he can make the kessel run in less than twelve parsecs
7019189 nothing just an anachronistic joke why dont you see what he can do before you judge him
7019190 i am sir brandon i have heard good things about you
7019191 a larriv e des secours il ny avait plus de fum e
7019192 i had a dream today it has come true but i still want more it was my bad luck that i could not do better my dream of an olympic medal has come true
7019193 it has been all positive and i cannot explain it earlier no one used to pay any attention to us but now even those who know nothing about boxing are pointing out our mistakes
7019194 we have become a boxing nation we have entered into the elite group of boxing and there are minimum 15 20 countries who either want to come to india for combined training or are inviting us for training
7019195 we were a bit disappointed with the way we handled the situation there
7019196 we wanted to execute certain plans which we couldnt but that game has gone the wicket and conditions are different here and all the batsmen are ready for the challenge
7019197 it is a different wicket and looks firm the ball will probably come nicely on to the bat so definitely there will be more runs it is all about getting used to the conditions and the performance on the day
7019198 in one day cricket bowlers do come into the play create opportunities and put pressure but batsmen have more responsibility as they are the ones who control the game because runs on the board are vital
7019199 he has been bowling for the last two days and looking good right now he has a very good chance of playing the match on sunday
7019200 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7019201 the idea that life sex and death are part of an interdependent unified system
7019202 this you must remember well and keep forever stored up in your inmost heart the remaining course of your life right up until your last breath is now solemnly promised to me by whose beneficence you will be made human again
7019203 instead here is a case where processing is positive in terms of enhancing absorption of lycopene
7019204 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
7019205 some people like to cook tomato sauce for prolonged periods sometimes reheating it day after day because it tastes better on the second and third day they add fat by using oil or meat and thats going to start to induce cis isomers of lycopene if fat is present and the cooking continues
7019206 so its possible people could induce this process and increase lycopene absorption by routine food preparation procedures as well
7019207 cet accident terrible provoque chez nous bien entendu la consternation et une immense peine
7019208 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7019209 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago

7019211 we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7019212 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience
7019213 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain
7019214 oh he he wasnt hurt as badly as we were led to believe
7019215 this will really help us under the cap if we say
7019216 we really hope he doesnt sign anywhere else because that would hurt us
7019217 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
7019218 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
7019219 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
7019220 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
7019221 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
7019222 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
7019223 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
7019224 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
7019225 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
7019226 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
7019227 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
7019228 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
7019229 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write
7019230 cell phone text messages cell phone picture mail and web blogs provide useful impeachment material
7019231 this type of evidence is becoming so important that i routinely instruct my investigators to search for it
7019232 the entire myspace page as well as the victims motives in broadcasting to the entire world about the case in her commentary became fertile grounds for impeachment against that witness
7019233 all of those sources provide excellent impeachment evidence against a witness that shows a motive to lie or fabricate against my client prejudice and bias against my client or a financial and legal interest in the outcome of the case
7019234 the more i know about a witness the more damaging my cross examination im able to exploit negative character evidence and negative inferences against that witness
7019235 social networking sites are just another way that people say things or do things that come back and haunt them
7019236 the things that people say online or leave online are pretty permanent
7019237 the problem with these networking sites is that it is really a domain of fiction and is therefore an unreliable source of information
7019238 anyone who uses such information in court proceedings without substantial corroboration is doing justice a grave disservice
7019239 there is nothing worse than at sentencing to be confronted with your clients myspace page complete with statements showing a lack of remorse inappropriate content or provocative pictures or having a client who feels compelled to use the web to announce to the world about the stash of drugs that the police didnt find when they searched his home
7019240 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time

7019242 gives a new perspective on the english civil war through the eyes of angelica fanshawe riseborough who is drawn to the anti monarchist cause at a time when england executed its king in favor of an alternative form of government
7019243 considering the british traditions of free speech and the individual and the british suspicion of organized crowds we would want to avoid the leni riefenstahl connotations which were there in beijing and the ceremony was too long
7019244 i never want to be pigeon holed im an entertainer whether im entertaining a teenage girl whos watching me judging on a tv show a young guy watching doctor who or a couple watching torchwood the fact i can diversify is great

7019254 it makes it a lot easier for things to come together that people may say are wrong but that are not necessarily illegal
7019255 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7019256 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

7019261 not so much interested in ensuring fair treatment of employees and the like as they are in redefining the very concept of kashrut
7019262 we shortened the morning practice a little the assignments were good and the effort was good

7019266 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
7019267 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
7019268 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7019269 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7019270 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7019271 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

7019281 when you think about the amount of information published to the web its a physical impossibility for the vast majority of that stuff to spread virally
7019282 its much more difficult to reach people today and much more expensive
7019283 the cost of media is accelerating and the ineffectiveness of media is accelerating
7019284 we had some big hits throughout the lineup tonight and were able to get runs across
7019285 they swept us there coming off a loss we really wanted to come out today and obviously win a game

7019290 we find it a little disingenuous that sen obama is hailing this as a new bold initiative when he has neglected to join his colleagues in the senate when the opportunities have been there to redirect our forces into afghanistan
7019291 its good to see sen obama has finally arrived at the right position but this can hardly be considered bold leadership

7019299 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7019300 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7019301 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7019302 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7019303 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7019304 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7019305 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7019306 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7019307 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7019308 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7019309 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7019310 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7019311 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7019312 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7019313 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7019314 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7019315 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7019316 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7019317 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7019318 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7019319 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7019320 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

7019322 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7019323 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7019324 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7019325 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7019326 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7019327 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7019328 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7019329 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7019330 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7019331 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7019332 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7019333 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7019334 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7019335 who are open to doing something on the production side
7019336 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7019337 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7019338 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7019339 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7019340 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7019341 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7019342 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7019343 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7019344 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7019345 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7019346 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7019347 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7019348 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7019349 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7019350 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7019351 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7019352 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7019353 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7019354 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7019355 the medal rich sports of track and field swimming rowing sailing and canoe kayak
7019356 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7019357 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7019358 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7019359 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7019360 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

7019366 i just wanted to say that i truly believe in your product and will continue to use it
7019367 there is no credible evidence that airborne products taken as directed will reduce the severity or duration of colds or provide any tangible benefit for people who are exposed to germs in crowded places
7019368 consumers can feel confident that the advertising and labeling going into the marketplace accurately reflects what airborne products do
7019369 airborne is the same product that millions of consumers swear by
7019370 if you think its true it is true for you
7019371 so yeah it was good for business until we pulled the product
7019372 when you think about the amount of information published to the web its a physical impossibility for the vast majority of that stuff to spread virally
7019373 its much more difficult to reach people today and much more expensive
7019374 the cost of media is accelerating and the ineffectiveness of media is accelerating
7019375 it took us a few days to shift some assets and get a clearer picture of what was actually going on
7019376 condi has dealt with moscow for so long as an academic that she has adopted a very mechanical view of the kind of relations we should have
7019377 we always knew it would be close its always difficult to beat an incumbent
7019378 shaheen spent 700 000 this summer and didnt move her numbers at all
7019379 what ive seen teachers do is take living breathing works of art and transform them into dessicated lab specimens fit for dissection
7019380 to my twelve year old self the book didnt seem to move anywhere i didnt understand why holden couldnt just try a little harder at school by tenth grade i had been drunk for the first time i knew rebellion against my parents the difficulties of teenage romance the fakeness of social interaction as a reader in the eleventh grade i grew close to holden he was a friend who understood me
7019381 why do we assume that every 15 year old who passes through sophomore english is an english major in the making
7019382 its simply not the case and the kids go elsewhere just as fast as they can anywhere but another book
7019383 require that 10 percent of our energy comes from renewable sources by the end of my first term more than double what we have now
7019384 we will get 1 million 150 mile per gallon plug in hybrids on our roads within six years
7019385 i will set a hard cap on all carbon emissions at a level that scientists say is necessary to curb global warming an 80 percent reduction by 2050
7019386 in colonial days when the only fuel we burned was wood
7019387 we dont want to return to marginal rates of 60 or 70 percent
7019388 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7019389 we fully recognize that the power we have inherited as the dominant morning newspaper in the capital of the free world carries with it special responsibilities to listen to the voiceless to avoid any and all acts of arrogance to face the public politely and candidly
7019390 has chosen to make choices sometimes very hard decisions based on shared values
7019391 abuse of the judicial system against anc president jacob zuma
7019392 students from tshwane soweto ekurhuleni vaal and the greater johannesburg area all came to show their frustrations with the system
7019393 we were just told to come here and have day off from school
7019394 we as the students are a militant force and are sending a strong message that if you touch zuma you must first face us the students
7019395 we dont need a commission from anyone especially if it takes instructions from someone with an agenda
7019396 shebeen the chief justice is a coward and his house is not in order
7019397 we respect such gestures the court belongs to everyone and hopefully the chief justice will respond to the memorandum
7019398 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7019399 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7019400 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7019401 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7019402 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7019403 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7019404 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7019405 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7019406 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7019407 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7019408 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

7019439 our findings suggest that msc therapy could become a useful treatment for inflammatory bowel disease
7019440 several previous studies have observed these cells ability to inhibit specific subsets of t cells and relieve symptoms in particular autoimmune disorders but this is the first demonstration of their ability to suppress a broad based autoimmune reaction and protect gastrointestinal tissue
7019441 the intestine may be an ideal site for msc therapy given its rapid ability to regrow tissue and its extensive local supply of lymph nodes and the route by which the cells were administered may have ensured a greater amount of engraftment in gut associated lymph nodes
7019442 before we can think about testing this approach in patients we need to know more about long term effects of msc infusion including immunosuppressive effects and gain more understanding of how mscs modulate immune cell activity in more realistic models of inflammatory bowel disease
7019443 discovering the amazing young men and women who make up the tr35 is one of the highlights of the year for us
7019444 the innovators on our 2008 list have made truly remarkable and valuable contributions
7019445 its really an exciting time because everyone is paying attention to the energy crisis
7019446 its such a great honor particularly given the quality of the people who have previously been named to the tr35
7019447 i must also recognize my wonderful collaborators without which this work would not have been possible and with whom i would like to share this award
7019448 we wanted to produce a large number of disease models for ourselves our collaborators and the stem cell research community to accelerate research
7019449 the original embryonic stem cell lines are generic and allow you to ask only basic questions but these new lines are valuable tools for attacking the root causes of disease our work is just the beginning for studying thousands of diseases in a petri dish
7019450 the suite of ips cell lines reported by the daley group marks an important achievement and a very significant advance for patients suffering from degenerative diseases these disease specific ips cells are invaluable tools that will allow researchers to watch the development of diseases in petri dishes outside of the patients and we have good reason to believe that this will make it possible to find new treatments and eventually drugs to slow or even stop the course of a number of diseases in years ahead
7019451 this report will be seen as opening the door to a new approach to develop therapies
7019452 this is certainly the case for drs daley and hochedlinger who deployed their directors award resources to advance our ability to use induced pluripotent stem cells for disease specific studies and drug development
7019453 the cell lines available from the ips core will allow stem cell researchers around the world to explore possible gene therapies for some conditions and will aid in the development of drugs for others
7019454 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
7019455 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
7019456 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
7019457 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
7019458 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
7019459 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
7019460 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
7019461 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional scene memory become unbound during sleep
7019462 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of
7019463 this moment is also known as finding your voice treasure this crash of ideals its truly a beautiful thing

7019465 with this consortium the field of psychiatry has come together in a way that is unprecedented
7019466 with the understanding that no individual study has enough power to ask these incredibly important questions
7019467 the consortium should be recognized for taking the important first step towards unearthing the full underlying genomic architecture of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
7019468 only by doing such a large study could we have uncovered these stunning findings to such a high degree of confidence thus setting the stage for an even more complete understanding of the full genomic contributions to disease
7019469 in this second generation of medical genetics we can use new genomic technologies to look at thousands of patients at a much finer resolution than ever before
7019470 it is encouraging that both research teams identified these same genomic sites
7019471 in light of these new findings there no longer needs to be an argument that this type of variation plays a role in some of the risk
7019472 the task now is to understand how rare structural variation together with other kinds of genetic variation and environmental effects work together to produce schizophrenia
7019473 this wonderful framework has enabled the development of new tools and made them rapidly available
7019474 plink is not only crucial to our studies of psychiatric genetics but because it and other analysis tools are made publicly available they are becoming the international standard for whole genome studies
7019475 just observing one of these events in a patient does not in itself tell you anything about the role of that particular variant in causing that persons disease
7019476 we now have a strong foothold into the genetic architecture of this psychiatric disease
7019477 it was an enormous privilege for me to work with julie during my deanship
7019478 whether i was seeking his advice on issues of childrens health or tobacco control honoring him at the annual julius b richmond award event or running into him in the hsph cafeteria which he visited regularly he was always fully engaged in pursuing his many passionate interests in health with incredible energy his presence will be sorely missed but he will continue to inspire us
7019479 contributions to medicine and public health nothing short of legendary he was a tireless and committed advocate for children and their well being here in the u s and around the globe
7019480 as a result of his remarkable work as a pediatrician as a public servant and as a champion for children and their families millions now lead better lives
7019481 through his many important roles in the academy and in government julius richmond did as much to improve the health of american citizens as anyone in the last century but by far the greatest beneficiaries of his lifes work were impoverished children and their parents in the united states and throughout the world
7019482 those of us who had the privilege of being his students and colleagues will miss him most for his warmth sage advice on matters large and small and most of all his commitment to social justice that served as a moral compass for us all
7019483 this finding by kevin eggan and his colleagues marks an important step in fulfilling the promise of regenerative medicine
7019484 it is yet more confirmation that the substantial risks that were taken in forming the harvard stem cell institute will ultimately pay off for both science and patients
7019485 no one has ever managed to isolate these neurons from a patient and grow them in a dish
7019486 now we can make limitless supplies of the cells that die in this awful disease this will allow us to study these neurons and als in a lab dish and figure out whats happening in the disease process
7019487 following the demonstration of ips by yamanaka and thompson in human cells a next major hurdle has been to generate ips cells from patients with an identified disease and in particular determine if the age of the patient would be a limitation to this approach in one set of experiments eggan dimos and rodolfa have proven that at least for als neither age nor progression of disease should hinder the generation of human ips cells other examples of human ips cells are in progress for other diseases and this publication is an encouragement for the field in general
7019488 over the last two years weve done everything we could within the law in massachusetts to recruit women to donate ova however we were never able to recruit enough donors because we were legally prevented from providing the same sort of compensation that these women would receive for donating their ova for in vitro fertilization
7019489 but its not yet come to fruition so when shinya yamanakas first creation of ips cells came along that opened up a new route for us and we decided to capitalize on that
7019490 its essential to note that we couldnt possibly be where we are now without first doing extensive work with human embryonic stem cells hesc further it will be essential to continue to do work with embryonic stem cells as they remain the stem cell gold standard
7019491 this conference was very well timed people came with new results it clicked together there was a lot of excitement
7019492 what happened this spring was a tipping point in the field
7019493 we can say this is the moment where we started the exploration of planets like earth
7019494 it means planets like earth are abundant and we can study them
7019495 five times larger than earth is actually pretty good from the point of view of geochemistry and biochemistry
7019496 ultimately we want to go down to sister earths as people call it its my personal belief that super earths are as hospitable to life as earths but we need to compare them people want to know if there are planets just like ours out there
7019497 we can look at a planet 60 light years away and tell you whats in the atmosphere this is really a big deal

7019501 tobacco industry control of menthol in cigarettes and targeting of adolescents and young adults
7019502 for decades the tobacco industry has carefully manipulated menthol content not only to lure youth but also to lock in lifelong adult customers
7019503 to protect the public health tobacco products should be federally regulated and additives such as menthol should be included in that regulation
7019504 this is another example of the cynical behavior of the tobacco industry to hook teens and african americans to a deadly addiction this is after the industry told the american public it had changed its marketing practices the fda bill provides the vehicle to end the hypocrisy and save the lives of the young and a targeted minority group
7019505 our innovation is applicable to edge emitting as well as surface emitting semiconductor lasers operating at any wavelength all the way from visible to telecom ones and beyond
7019506 it is an important first step towards beam engineering of lasers with unprecedented flexibility tailored for specific applications in the future we envision being able to achieve total control of the spatial emission pattern of semiconductor lasers such as a fully collimated beam small divergence beams in multiple directions and beams that can be steered over a wide angle
7019507 such an advance could also lead to a wide range of applications at the shorter wavelengths used for optical communications a very narrow angular spread of the laser beam can greatly reduce the complexity and cost of optical systems by eliminating the need for the lenses to couple light into optical fibers and waveguides
7019508 for a small mammal finding food on a daily basis is a critical mission
7019509 even a few days of starvation is a common threat in natural environments and may result in the animals death
7019510 this system works extremely well light signals from the retina help establish the animals circadian rhythms to the standard day night cycle
7019511 this new timepiece enables animals to switch their sleep and wake schedules in order to maximize their opportunity of finding food
7019512 in addition to the oscillator cells in the scn there are other oscillator cells in the brain as well as in peripheral tissues like the stomach and liver that contribute to the development of animals food based circadian rhythms
7019513 we discovered that a single cycle of starvation followed by refeeding turns on the clock so that it effectively overrides the suprachiasmatic nucleus and hijacks all of the circadian rhythms onto a new time zone that corresponds with food availability
7019514 modern day humans may be able to use these findings in an adaptive way if for example you are traveling from the u s to japan you are forced to adjust to an 11 hour time difference
7019515 because the bodys biological clock can only shift a small amount each day it takes the average person about a week to adjust to the new time zone and by then its often time to turn around and come home
7019516 a period of fasting with no food at all for about 16 hours is enough to engage this new clock
7019517 so in this case simply avoiding any food on the plane and then eating as soon as you land should help you to adjust and avoid some of the uncomfortable feelings of jet lag
7019518 life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs
7019519 if you like itunes and you are one of the billion people residing in china you may have noticed that you songs for tibet was downloaded more than 40 times by olympic athletes as a sign of solidarity for tibets cause ironically this compilation had songs criticizing the great firewall of china and that is the very thing that prohibited these songs from reaching the chinese public artists on the compilation include alanis morissette garbage imogen heap moby sting suzanne vega underworld and others
7019520 its not just youtube thats blocked in china after the unrest in tibet at least

7019524 the groundbreaking work is particularly significant because it supports a model of autism as a condition that disrupts the brains ability to form new connections in response to experience this has been an area of intense research and these new findings begin to bring the pieces together
7019525 this work provides an important example of what can be achieved when basic researchers work closely with clinicians and with families
7019526 to map a gene for autism in american families averaging two to three kids per family you would need to pool many families
7019527 in larger families one family alone may be enough to definitively localize a gene
7019528 we check each set of chromosomes from beginning to end looking for one place where the child has two identical pieces of dna on both chromosomes
7019529 eventually we find a spot where all affected children have two identical chunks of dna and where unaffected children have something different
7019530 this network can be disrupted in a myriad of ways and may be one mechanism that people with a variety of autism linked mutations share
7019531 taken together our findings suggest that experience dependent learning could be relevant to autism and that autism might result from the deregulation of any one of a number of genes that are part of the same signaling pathway
7019532 this means that we would not need to replace the gene if we could only figure out how to reactivate it perhaps with medications
7019533 this publication a big event in the world of autism research
7019534 venkys leadership has had a genuinely transformative impact on engineering and applied sciences at harvard
7019535 he has in many ways been both the architect and the chief engineer of harvards newest school and his vision energy and instinct for collaboration have strengthened our capacity and elevated our sights in a vital academic domain its been a pleasure to work with him and i join his many admirers in saluting his service to the university
7019536 its been a tremendous privilege to serve at harvard and in engineering and applied sciences
7019537 i am particularly grateful for the wonderful support i have received at all levels and i believe seas is exceptionally well positioned for the future i will watch from the sidelines with great interest as it continues to develop and take its place among the great schools of harvard
7019538 i am of course saddened that the day has arrived when venky has decided to step down as dean of the seas he is a visionary leader who gets the job done it was his leadership that moved engineering and applied sciences from a division to a school
7019539 i will always cherish the memories of my work with venky during my time as a member of the engineering faculty and as the dean of fas he has been a mentor and valued colleague to so many of us at harvard while he is stepping down as dean i am pleased that we will have the opportunity to continue to work with him as he resumes his full time teaching and research activities i will continue to seek his counsel and his wisdom as long as he is willing to give it
7019540 i am very grateful to dean venky for his extraordinary leadership in strengthening engineering and applied sciences at harvard over the last decade
7019541 through his efforts recruiting vital new faculty expanding interdisciplinary collaboration and bringing seas to its well deserved place as a school at harvard university dean venky leaves a legacy of inspired leadership which will not be forgotten
7019542 in just a decade dean venky has brought this center for the applied sciences to a new level of educational relevance and scholarly distinction and his successor will inherit a vibrant and collaborative group of colleagues who are interacting productively with many other faculties at harvard and beyond
7019543 when in the mid 1990s we solicited venkys advice about the leadership of what was then the division of engineering and applied sciences it was quickly clear that we wanted more than just his advice we wanted him thus it came to pass that the fas has benefited enormously from venkys insight his high standards and his spirit and we are mightily grateful for all of that
7019544 marks an important first step in finding ways to create pluripotent stem cells from adult cells without the need for viruses or oncogenes
7019545 have engineered new viral systems to introduce this into skin cells with this new viral system we were able to control the behavior of these four genes
7019546 skin cell markers are turned off very early in the first two or three days and after eight or nine days
7019547 other pluripotency genes are activated this is the first framework for zooming in on this process and will allow us to ask whats happening at day five day six and so on
7019548 the importance of this finding is that it will tell us how long we need to throw chemicals or proteins on the cells for the programming to be effective
7019549 it could have been that these viruses are only necessary for two days or three weeks
7019550 if you know a certain chemical or protein becomes dangerous after 10 days but youll only need to use it for eight days you have learned something important
7019551 is that we found molecular cornerstones of the reprogramming process using a series of surface markers weve defined the sequence of events that occurs during the reprogramming up to this point it was unknown what the sequence of events occurring was but using these markers we have been able to define what happens during reprogramming
7019552 our papers refutes the argument currently gaining ground that as overall population health improves it is inevitable that socioeconomic disparities in health will increase allegedly because the better off more quickly take advantage of health promoting resources
7019553 instead we clearly show that this argument is flawed because in the period from 1966 to 1980 socioeconomic disparities declined in tandem with a decline in mortality rates
7019554 why people misimagine the future the problem of attentional collapse
7019555 our predicted enjoyment is strongly influenced by the mental comparisons we make
7019556 we expect a family reunion to be dull if we compare it with a trip to bermuda and delightful if we compare it with working an extra shift but these comparisons end up having relatively little influence on our actual experience of the family reunion because the acts of greeting relatives and grilling hamburgers demand our attention leaving us little time to think about all the other things we might have done instead
7019557 leaving us little time to think about the alternatives to it
7019558 a very slow family reunion may well be worse if the alternative was bermuda than if the alternative was working an extra shift
7019559 when experiences dont demand our attention our minds are free to wander to all the other things we might have been doing instead if those things are better we feel worse and if they are worse we feel better
7019560 we think we will be thinking about the roads not taken
7019561 but the fact is that whatever road we choose in life requires that we navigate it and doing so limits our ability to compare that road to its alternatives lifes untaken roads come to mind much less often than we expect them to

7019566 trust is the baseline says susan fiske a social psychologist at princeton university
7019567 i was here first why dont people in some countries form neat orderly lines
7019568 in cuba they have a kind of virtual line you just ask el ultimo the last and the last person in the line raises his hand it is an excellent system for long lines you know exactly your place when the line moves and you do not have to wait standing up
7019569 this is an exciting extremely significant moment in the history of hsci
7019570 this kind of collaborative alliance with glaxosmithkline one of the worlds leading research based pharmaceutical and healthcare companies will allow the harvard stem cell institute to ultimately fulfill its promise of advancing stem cell science to benefit patients this infusion of research support builds upon the generosity of our donors which continues to be vitally important for our ongoing success
7019571 gsk believes stem cell science has great potential to aid the discovery of new medicines by improving the screening identification and development of new compounds we have carefully chosen the boston biomedical community to collaborate with on this important venture it has the highest concentration of leading stem cell scientists and the harvard stem cell institute is the epicenter of that community
7019572 a significant milestone for hsci that furthers our mission of actualizing science to develop therapeutics for patients this agreement demonstrates hscis novel approach to collaboration and is the first of additional ventures to come in the future
7019573 this study indicates the presence of renewing muscle stem cells in adult skeletal muscle and demonstrates the potential benefit of stem cell therapy for the treatment of muscle degenerative diseases such as muscular dystrophy
7019574 extremely significant this provides proof of concept for treating a degenerative condition by implanting stem cells
7019575 once the healthy stem cells were transplanted into the muscles of the mice with muscular dystrophy they generated cells that incorporated into the diseased muscle and substantially improved the ability of the treated muscles to contract
7019576 at the same time the transplantation of the healthy stem cells replenished the formerly diseased stem cell pool providing a reservoir of healthy stem cells that could be re activated to repair the muscle again during a second injury
7019577 this work demonstrates in concept that stem cell therapy could be beneficial for degenerative muscle diseases
7019578 this is still very basic science but i think were going to be able to move forward in a lot of directions it opens up many exciting avenues
7019579 the 13 percent loss in real dollars over the last five years is having a cascading impact that is slowing progress and threatening future research that could lead to cures and even ways to prevent disease
7019580 leading scientists with quality grant proposals are caught in a protracted grant review process that plays out often over years not months
7019581 as a result investigators are downsizing labs slowing research and producing more conservative less ambitious proposals more likely to secure funding
7019582 junior faculty who witness the struggles of their advisers are asking themselves how they can possibly compete with their mentors for a piece of the reduced research pie
7019583 at the same time they are mentoring their own students and working to encourage the next generation of students who could and should be tomorrows pioneers in science the result too often is a ladder of discouragement that we hope our country recognizes and begins to address today
7019584 you cant throw a rock around harvard without hitting a scientist who is having trouble getting funding
7019585 a broken pipeline flat funding of the nih puts a generation of science at risk
7019586 this is a real problem discussed at almost every meeting one attends on campus that cant be simply dismissed
7019587 this is about the investment that america is or is not making in the health of its citizens and its economy right now the nations brightest young researchers upon whom the future of american medicine rests are getting the message that biomedical research may be a dead end and that they should explore other career options and in too many cases theyre taking that message to heart the presidents latest budget proposal that calls for another year without an increase will only make the problem worse
7019588 theres been a lot of discussion in the last year about the negative impact of the tight nih budget on senior researchers and their labs but it appears that junior investigators may be having the toughest time in this fiscal climate theyre competing for funding with established researchers who are their mentors and finding that the financial support just isnt there or that they cant afford to support themselves while writing and rewriting grant proposals
7019589 my first and second nih funding applications were scored low and werent funded i submitted a similar proposal to the national science foundation which scored the proposal very high but declined to fund it because they were certain it would win nih funding
7019590 the situation would be dire enough if as it was described in an earlier report we only were having to cope with a slow down in realizing the promises of discoveries but as this new report points out we are in danger of losing the members of the next generation of biomedical leaders and if we allow that to happen the results will truly be catastrophic for our scientific knowledge base for those suffering from disease and for our national economy
7019591 reviewers told us we have good data a strong team and well thought out experiments we didnt get funded just because there were others going for their second and third round who were waiting in line
7019592 jesus died for us that means jesus died for me god died for me

7019594 if jesus died for me he is always thinking of me always loving me and i i should always be thinking of him always loving him
7019595 fay will be near or over the gulf coast of the western florida panhandle today and tonight and near or over the gulf coast of mississippi and alabama on sunday
7019596 fay is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches across the western portion of the northern florida peninsula the florida panhandle southwestern georgia and the southern half of both mississippi and alabama with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches possible
7019597 regardless of its exact track fay will be moving rather slowly during the next several days posing a significant heavy rainfall and flood hazard to a very large area
7019598 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage

7019638 weaving a product into the entertainment as opposed to breaking up the entertainment which is what ads tend to do is a smart strategy
7019639 it is getting easier to avoid watching traditional tv advertising
7019640 the consumer increasingly has the power to change the way they consume content and that has really driven the whole trend towards product placement
7019641 those placements are not designed to jump out at you as an ad would but its still very very powerful its not explicit advertising but we do know that while youre watching a program all of the content that you see as a whole goes in
7019642 i believe people will tolerate you talking about yourself in a 30 second commercial or even a 60 second commercial but when it gets to 30 minutes youre pushing the limit when youre conscious it is a product placement it becomes distracting
7019643 i think they stopped it at 60 to 70 brands represented in that movie if you have too much product placement it just becomes an ad and people are not that interested in watching a two hour ad

7019670 if a guy has a setback and it keeps him out of it for a week or two i dont know that anyone will remember that any player missed a week of practice or was dealing with an issue

7019884 i realised i should be thankful for my gorgeous sons and decided i was going to take this horrible disease on and win
7019885 it is unbelievable how life is so unpredictable and finds a way to distract and derail you from your plans

7019949 now that youve worked really hard to get yourself to this point it is time to deliver
7019950 so that youre on the right track in the style of that new organization
7019951 in most circumstances your boss will agree to meet with you weekly and give you feedback
7019952 for a new staff member the company orientation documentation provides a little bit of structure to very quickly get assimilated into the corporate culture
7019953 checklists background information and videos help set the benchmark and the job rhythm
7019954 usually theres somebody more senior more experienced and willing to help you and coach you to success
7019955 introduce yourself to people you dont know in the hallways near your work space in meetings in the break room and always with a smile

7019958 we have daily crosscurrents from the financial sector where one day there is widespread concern that the credit crisis is getting worse and the next day its getting better
7019959 falling oil prices is the best thing that can happen to the stock market
7019960 good for all kinds of stocks because people have a little more money for spending on apparel or television sets or at the supermarket
7019961 i think that the growing likelihood that the treasury and perhaps federal reserve will have to move vigorously to prop up fannie and freddie has the market and investors on edge

7019963 one more reason for congress to step up to the plate on comprehensive modernization of our regulatory structure

7019966 i expected the share price to shoot to say sh20 the current price means that i have to repay part of the loan i had taken to buy the shares from my income
7019967 i got excited about the ipo having missed out on the kengen kenya power generating company one out of which my friends made a lot of money i went for a loan from equity bank to finance the shares
7019968 in future i will only finance any ipo shares from my own savings i am now struggling to repay the loan
7019969 this often leads to increased supply similarly the money market has suffered disinterest such a market devoid of players can cool off
7019970 they have to forget about speculation of where the price is headed i know most people expected the price to shoot to about sh10 but their expectations were misguided
7019971 for instance if somebody was allocated 800 million shares and the price appreciates by a shilling the sale of such shares yields sh800 million as returns that is good money

7019991 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
7019992 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
7019993 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
7019994 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
