5010001 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it

5010003 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states

5010006 the diary itself is hugely significant as the personal diary of major lee who led the regiment fighting in the boer war
5010007 but at the back of the diary there are a series of hand written poems signed banjo paterson
5010008 one of the poems is all about the horses on board they were forever falling down which caused chaos and it stands to reason paterson was inspired to write that poem while he was on the ss kent
5010009 most are known banjo paterson poems that predate the publication dates but in some cases they have verses significantly different from those in the published editions
5010010 we need to have the handwriting authenticity verified but it will be costly
5010011 mum can purchase and prepare the food but dads will often have less greens or just meat and potato the kids think mum makes me eat this and she is painted as the bad guy
5010012 fathers influence the food and physical activity habits in the home through their behaviours attitudes and approach to food and eating and act as a role model to their children
5010013 these dads are still allowed to have a beer and enjoy things in moderation it was subtle changes to their nutritional habits that made the difference they see their lives change they sleep better and have much more fun together
5010014 i enjoy fatherhood very much apart from my wife they are my two best friends i hope they still use me as a guide as they grow up

5010035 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
5010036 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5010037 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5010038 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing but eventually she just gave in and at every party wed kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5010039 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship she once said samanthas the father i never had

5010051 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

5010055 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5010056 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5010057 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5010058 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5010059 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5010060 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5010061 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5010062 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5010063 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5010064 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5010065 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5010066 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5010067 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5010068 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5010069 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5010070 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5010071 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5010072 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5010073 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5010074 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5010075 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5010076 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5010077 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5010078 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5010079 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5010080 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5010081 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5010082 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5010083 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5010084 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5010085 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5010086 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5010087 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5010088 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5010089 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5010090 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5010091 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5010092 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5010093 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5010094 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5010095 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5010096 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5010097 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5010098 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5010099 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5010100 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5010101 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5010102 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5010103 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5010104 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5010105 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5010106 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5010107 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5010108 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5010109 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5010110 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5010111 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5010112 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5010113 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5010114 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5010115 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5010116 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5010117 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5010118 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5010119 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile

5010134 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5010135 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5010136 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

5010159 the three key things on the prevention of blindness is to have the right human resources in the primary eye clinics operating theatres and the right programs to deal with each disease the cause blindness
5010160 money must be put more on the prevention of blindness then rehabilitation and education people who are already blind it does not make sense to wait of someone to go blind and then come in to rehabilitate and educate
5010161 generally most of these people are poor farmers who live in these parks and they are isolated in those remote areas
5010162 we are thinking of exploring a way on how we can set up a distribution center in the united states because thats where most requests come from with that i think we can set a high price there for this product and the profits will be returned to the community conservation programs
5010163 i have been in this business two years now it is sustainable and profitable and now most of the zambian women are also getting interested in buying our products rather than buying cheap things made in asia

5010179 we will follow the normal procedures the disciplinary commission will meet in the coming days
5010180 id be surprised if it is as simple as a firmware upgrade of the chip so it is more likely that existing devices will have this defect forever
5010181 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5010182 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5010183 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5010184 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5010185 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5010186 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5010187 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5010188 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5010189 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5010190 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5010191 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5010192 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5010193 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5010194 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5010195 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5010196 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5010197 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5010198 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5010199 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5010200 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5010201 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5010202 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5010203 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5010204 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5010205 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5010206 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5010207 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5010208 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5010209 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5010210 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5010211 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5010212 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5010213 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5010214 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5010215 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5010216 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5010217 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5010218 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5010219 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5010220 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5010221 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5010222 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5010223 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5010224 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5010225 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5010226 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5010227 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5010228 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5010229 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5010230 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5010231 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5010232 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5010233 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5010234 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5010235 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5010236 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5010237 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5010238 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5010239 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

5010250 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5010251 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5010252 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5010253 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5010254 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

5010261 a recent analysis by morris davis of the university of wisconsin madison and andreas lehnert and robert martin of the fed shows that the rent price yield in america ranged between 5 and 5 5 from 1960 to 1995 but fell rapidly thereafter to reach a historic low of 3 5 at the height of the boom given the typical pace of rental growth mr feroli reckons house prices as measured by the case shiller index need to fall by 10 15 over the next year and a half for the rent price yield to return to its historical average again that suggests the national housing bust is only halfway through
5010262 but apart from that first 2004 investment in weblogs inc there havent been any sales or liquidity events to suggest these investments will be a success and back then blogging was a cake walk most bloggers linked to each other constantly in a state of brotherly or sisterly love no one was making any money or getting much attention so for the most part people got along with notable exceptions like engadget gizmodo who play to win those salad days are long gone writers suddenly want to be paid market wages far above the 5 per post that they received two years ago no were talking a big salary with benefits and stock options there went half your margins at least and writing good content is only half the battle you have to figure out the complex dynamic web of politics between bloggers and mainstream media before you post to know where to get support and youll need support in the form of links from other prominent bloggers an early push can take a post and make it a headline on techmeme which leads to page views and notice by sponsors but since blogging is almost by definition a conversation between bloggers fights tend to break out over emotional issues cliques develop can you count on them to support you down the road

5010267 i am really happy about the arrival of more argentinian players in the premier league it demonstrates the status of argentinian football in the world
5010268 newcastle are difficult opponents to begin the season against although our challenge is to win all our matches at old trafford
5010269 i think they newcastle can fight for a high position in the table kevin keegan is a coach with much experience and the work hes done this summer has been positive
5010270 last season we beat newcastle and scored a lot of goals but the situation now is different

5010273 i thank nico because he is making a great contribution
5010274 everyone can see what he does on the field but he is also valuable because he is helping me in a role that is not mine
5010275 it will be a difficult match but i think well play much better than them
5010276 we will not make any mistake against them or we may pay for that

5010279 when the same offence would have been committed by a player in possession of an english passport then this player wouldnt have had to pay any damages at this dismissal since the fa premier league rules do not provide this
5010280 for this reason this can be considered as discrimination based on nationality
5010281 it is extremely strange that a player who is dismissed by a club must pay damages based on the transfer amount previously paid for him whilst he has had no control whatsoever on the amount of this fee
5010282 we have finally got understanding of our point of view that poland being a crucial partner of nato and an important friend and ally of the united states must also be safe
5010283 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
5010284 as soon as we are sure that polands security has been reinforced to the degree we want we are not going to wait for hours to sign a deal
5010285 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed

5010352 somos un grupo de amigos que cada vez que nos subimos a un escenario lo hacemos con ganas de pasarlo bien y eso se transmite al p blico evidentemente las formaciones cambian por distintas circustancias y no todo el mundo tiene disponibilidad absoluta para dedicar su vida al rock and roll la gente que ahora me acompa a en directo son amigos y son los que tocan en los discos normalmente solemos estar de acuerdo en las decisiones aunque lleve yo la voz cantante por componer las canciones y tener m s antiguedad
5010353 es muy importante haber tenido a espa a pendiente de esto

5010396 who are these guys and why cant they play baseball
5010397 adam is getting stretched out and is out to 120 feet he is going to start throwing bullpens and sim games here soon and should be ready to go towards the end of the month most likely he will not be game ready pitching towards the end of the minor league season so we are just going to get him ready for instructional league and in winter ball he most likely will go pitch in the dominican republic or venezuela you get to the end of the season and now cranking him up to then shut him down we are just going to focus on getting him as many innings as possible well have him pitch as a starter and that is really to get him the most innings and has no bearing on whether he starts or relieves next year we are hopeful to get 60 innings out of this offseason to make him a cant miss for eric wedge and mark shapiro next year
5010398 tony has been incredible he really has he came back stronger is pitching well and doing more than we expected he has had a couple of hiccups with strike throwing in akron recently but he has really been great this year he is strong and his velocity is up his last few outings have been great and he just had a couple outings where it spiked his era a little bit it is a testament to his athleticism really to see how well he has returned from tommy john surgery i certainly think he will be a candidate at some point next year in the bullpen he has a lot of swing and miss and he has a lot of deception to his delivery where right handers do not pick him up either he does not have a traditional left handed delivery he is a little bit open so therefore he really attacks lefties and righties the same
5010399 no one is excited about going back to triple a and we have seen a lot of it this year with an asdrubal cabrera aaron laffey and all of these guys who have transitioned back and forth between triple a and the major leagues you think about cliff lee and what he accomplished and where he was at this time last year and where he is right now i think he set the bar pretty high for some guys and they are following suit aaron laffey has been nothing but professional down there and he is ready to make some subtle adjustments to get back to the major leagues it is a lot of things what comes first is hard to say the confidence or the success as one usually starts to feed off the other i think some people thought he was a little fatigued and his arm speed was certainly down but i think there are some subtle adjustments that he will be able to more readily make in triple a we had him watch video take some time for him to work on his delivery without having to go back out and strike someone out with a runner on second and third just to take some time to more readily focus on those delivery adjustments in a controlled setting
5010400 we know he can hit but we are talking about the elite is he going to hit at a clip like a victor martinez or a pudge rodriguez we know he has the ability to hit and has the ability to compete at the major leagues for him we think the key is just being a plus defender because he has the ability to do it last year he threw out more than anybody in baseball as he was near 50 in throwing out runners he just has a natural knack for calling a game is a natural leader loves to take charge of the pitching staff and has a lot of pride as a catcher so we just want to make sure that is his focus and if the bat comes even more than what it is already projected to be that is an added bonus what he is doing right now is a complete testament to him he has spread out and is a little bit wider he has shortened up his bat path and it hasnt sacrificed his power where on the contrary he has a little bit more of it really a great year having started the year in buffalo and not really a demotion by any means but coming into akron and having the success he is having he knows how to handle adversity
5010401 really a tough year for him in some ways he was injured in his last spring training outing and we were expecting a lot out of scott this year so he missed over half the season and is back into the fold now and is pretty much dominating double a and is letting us know he belongs at another level so we will sort through when is the best time for him to start to transition to more greater challenges but at this point what we are focused on with scott is helping get to a threshold where he is starting depth for us next year which means he needs another 40 innings
5010402 he probably has a pretty good feel of coming through in the clutch having experienced what he has experienced in being such a high profile guy he shortens up his swing and has a very professional approach to hitting as a 19 year old i think that may be the most influential number to talk about when you look at his numbers and that is his age he is only 19 years old competing with a lot of 21 and 22 year olds
5010403 he is the most complete player we got in the draft with the ability to impact the game in different areas he is a good base runner a great defender and has a very polished approach coming out of an incredible program in stanford he is a very mature professional baseball player
5010404 he plays hard and plays everyday he is a center of the diamond player with some power he is athletic and steals a bag too
5010405 strong track record before going through the minor shoulder problem and then the whole throat stomach thing he had late if you needed a big hit in a crucial situation if you needed a quality start against another teams ace this was the guy the ultimate college baseball player you cant really put into words what he meant to michigans program the last three years hard to say hes an overdraft when he was slated to go in the late first or first supplemental round and slid to the fifth extreme value in that round probably profiles as more as a late inning reliever but hes got enough stuff five pitches to start power fb with arm side run and sink to it split is second best pitch sl got better as the year progressed and was his go to pitch when he didnt have the power to the fb after losing 19 pounds with the viral infection cb is kind of an afterthought gave hitters a different look in college but is a well below average ml pitch

5010558 when we decide to take individual action we have to be prepared whatever that comes we will face it
5010559 these movements must strengthen the voices of moderation against racism for political freedom a more just and equal society anwar has articulated all this
5010560 we are pleased with this visit and hope it will inspire the rest in bn to look at the current political development that has to be based on the rakyat supremacy and not racial politics

5010577 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
5010578 in the summer of 2007 as arctic sea ice reached a record low the northwest passage opened between baffin bay and mcclure strait also known as mclure strait passing through parry channel this opening would be the route through the arctic most conducive to large scale shipping as of early august 2008 arctic sea ice was not expected to set a new melt record although its extent was well below the long term average whether the northwest passage would open as far north as it did the previous year remained in question but the sea ice in a more southerly route one taken by norwegian explorer roald amundsen in the early twentieth century had begun to melt

5010586 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5010587 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5010588 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5010589 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5010590 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5010591 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5010592 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5010593 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
5010594 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
5010595 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
5010596 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime
5010597 science keeps getting stronger and the mathematical models keep getting better
5010598 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
5010599 liberals are more self centered than conservatives conservatives are more generous and charitable than liberals liberals are more envious and less hardworking than conservatives conservatives value truth more than liberals and are less prone to cheating and lying liberals are more angry than conservatives conservatives are actually more knowledgeable than liberals liberals are more dissatisfied and unhappy than conservatives

5010601 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5010602 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5010603 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5010604 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
5010605 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
5010606 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
5010607 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
5010608 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
5010609 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
5010610 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
5010611 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
5010612 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
5010613 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
5010614 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
5010615 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
5010616 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5010617 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5010618 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5010619 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5010620 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5010621 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5010622 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5010623 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5010624 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5010625 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5010626 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5010627 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5010628 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature

5010634 i like this writers way with words valentine is an amazing book that everyone shoul read he builds a good plot and develops his characters well i would give it 5 stars out of 5
5010635 jamieson wolf writes with some of the strongest emotion i have found in ages his passion is reminiscent of that seen in the works of shakespeare and others of that time period his characters love deeply and without restraint overcoming every obstacle placed before them this is truly a tale for all those who believe love has no boundaries
5010636 jamieson wolf is what i would call a fabulous storyteller he dreams up or gets visited by great characters and he paints them vividly when he writes he gets fantastic story ideas and pounds them out in a way that makes you lean in toward the computer screen or flip through the physical pages faster and faster to see whats happening to these people next

5010640 ho vinto grazie alla determinazione e alla capacit di reagire dopo leliminazione nei 400 ha commentato federica alla fine della gara
5010641 e stata una gara velocissima ha detto lazzurra con la statunitense katie hoff fuori dal podio nonostante il record americano quarta in 1 55 78 sapevo che non potevo mollare neanche un centimetro e sconfitte subite in rimonta dalla rumena potec alle olimpiadi di atene e dalla francese figues ai mondiali di montreal mi hanno insegnato molto
5010642 ne ho messo uno da allenamento sotto a quello da gara onde evitare di strapparlo come successo nelle batterie e mostrare a tutti tutto quanto
5010643 il rapporto con luca mi stato utile perch mi ha dato serenit mi ha fatto i complimenti ma ci che mi ha emozionata stata la telefonata dallitalia con i miei
5010644 finalmente dopo largento di atene finalmente loro ho avuto un anno tra alti e bassi e dopo i giochi non vedo lora di una vacanza al mare
5010645 beh finora la cosa mi riuscita mettiamola cos questanno dar un po pi spazio alla tiv ma senza togliere tempo agli allenamenti
5010646 money may come or may not come but this number 1 wont come again if i missed it in this auction
5010647 ellen degeneres and portia de rossi were married tonight in an intimate ceremony at their home in los angeles
5010648 parties have no constitutional right to be part of the primary system
5010649 its basically taking a choice away from the voters by pushing out any of the smaller parties
5010650 we dont allow ppl to bring outside food and eat it in our restaurant but since theres a birthday we will let it go but not next time
5010651 you guys missed your race the boats are in the water already
5010652 i have a feeling thats going to be me next year
5010653 i truly believe that the florida division of elections every decision that came from their office favored bush
5010654 hannah montana and miley cyrus best of both worlds concert
5010655 a lottery and you know that with lotteries you lose most of the time
5010656 theres nothing like taking a nice quiet bomb apart to steady the nerves
5010657 the worlds youth have a huge personal stake in global warming
5010658 after all it is our future that hangs in the balance the inconvenient youth network will give a voice to the many youth around the world who want to make difference now
5010659 we believe the climate change problem can be solved and youth will make a difference this group of 80 trainees will tap into their local communities and quickly grow to a network of over a thousand youth were already working to schedule sessions at campuses across the nation
5010660 were going beyond facebook to get this issue in the face of adults and other teens together we can solve it
5010661 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5010662 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5010663 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5010664 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5010665 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5010666 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5010667 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5010668 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5010669 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5010670 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5010671 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5010672 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5010673 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5010674 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5010675 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5010676 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5010677 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5010678 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5010679 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5010680 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5010681 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
5010682 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5010683 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5010684 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
5010685 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5010686 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5010687 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5010688 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5010689 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5010690 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
5010691 my breast is about as 1 4 as big as my cat butterscotch
5010692 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5010693 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
5010694 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
5010695 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
5010696 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
5010697 chiffres auxquels on sattendait et qui ne sont pas bons
5010698 les augmentations du cours des mati res premi res laffaiblissement du dollar
5010699 ce qui est important cest de se demander ce quil va se passer dans les mois qui viennent
5010700 toute personne qui crierait au loup la r cession aurait un trimestre davance
5010701 mais je pense que nous avons un nombre de r formes qui vont entrer en vigueur maintenant qui vont nous mettre dans le bon sens
5010702 ik heb rtl8 op 29 gezet ik kijk er toch nooit naar
5010703 abandon las instalaciones sin entregar al nuevo administrador las llaves de la misma
5010704 hab a un hueco donde antes hab a sido instalada una caja fuerte
5010705 por lo que no se puede asegurar con certeza que el 2 de octubre estuviese la caja de seguridad y en caso de que estuviese el dinero que hab a en su interior
5010706 respald la acci n violenta esgrimiendo tambi n un arma de fuego y sin que se haya podido acreditar si lleg a utilizarla
5010707 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5010708 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5010709 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5010710 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5010711 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5010712 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5010713 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5010714 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5010715 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5010716 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5010717 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
5010718 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5010719 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5010720 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5010721 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5010722 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5010723 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5010724 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5010725 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5010726 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5010727 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5010728 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5010729 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5010730 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5010731 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5010732 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5010733 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5010734 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5010735 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5010736 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5010737 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5010738 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5010739 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5010740 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5010741 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5010742 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5010743 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5010744 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5010745 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5010746 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5010747 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5010748 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5010749 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
5010750 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5010751 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5010752 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5010753 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5010754 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5010755 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5010756 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5010757 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5010758 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5010759 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5010760 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
5010761 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5010762 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
5010763 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
5010764 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
5010765 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
5010766 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
5010767 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
5010768 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
5010769 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
5010770 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5010771 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5010772 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5010773 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5010774 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5010775 just so you all know we did set a record
5010776 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5010777 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5010778 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5010779 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5010780 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5010781 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5010782 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5010783 backstory is a quick way to catch up on how a story has developed over time
5010784 now when we want to give history context and background to a developing story we go back through our archives to find milestone events and then link those together in an interactive window
5010785 kalau mengenai apakah sampai pada fatwa haram atau bagaimana itu silakan saja dikaji sesuai hukum islam tapi bahwa semangat antirokok khususnya bagi anak anak dan remaja harus didukung
5010786 karena akan sangat susah memberitahu anak sekolah untuk tidak merokok bila para gurunya memberikan contoh yang tidak baik
5010787 theres huge fascination in examining the human personality under the trauma of a murder investigation all of us present a carapace to the world that conceals things we wish to keep to ourselves in a murder investigation these defences are often torn down
5010788 i move in with them i sympathise with the view trollope expressed that you have to get up with your characters and live with them all day
5010789 a popular novelist of the 1930s and 1940s whose prose and content absolutely defeated us
5010790 i think dorothy whipple is compulsively readable and perceptive and the 20th century mrs gaskell
5010791 there is one question this volume answers conclusively why readers nap
5010792 ich bin nat rlich sehr ungl cklich ber diesen unfall muss mich allerdings bei den organisatoren und dem medizinischen team f r ihre tolle arbeit bedanken
5010793 die st rke meines ford focus mein helm und die hilfe von giovanni giovanni bernacchini anm d red haben dazu beigetragen meine verletzungen in einem kleinen bereich zu halten
5010794 das h tte meiner meinung nach viel schlimmer ausgehen k nnen ich f hle mich etwas m de aber nach der operation geht es mir so schlecht nicht ungl cklicherweise werden mich meine fans einige monate lang nicht sehen k nnen ich freue mich allerdings schon auf eine schnelle erholung und eine baldige r ckkehr auf die strecke
5010795 es ist nat rlich gro artig hier nach wenigen tests und auf neuen reifen gleich auf das podium zu fahren f r uns war es schon immer eine gro e herausforderung um den sieg zu k mpfen denn die anderen fahrer treten das ganze jahr ber an und haben reichlich getestet
5010796 das ergebnis f hlt sich sehr gut an wir haben einige verbesserungen beim setup erzielt und mehr ber die reifen gelernt da steckt also viel positives drin diese erfahrungen werden uns bei den anstehenden asphalt rallyes entgegen kommen
5010797 f r mich war das ein ganz besonderes resultat beinahe wie ein sieg die ersten punkte auf asphalt zu holen ist eine tolle leistung und wir sind hier einige schritte voran gekommen
5010798 es war eine schwierige rallye f r mich denn ich habe nun einmal nicht viel erfahrung auf asphalt
5010799 ich bin hierher gekommen um zu lernen und mich zu verbessern ich wusste schon im vorfeld dass ich nicht mit den siegern w rde mithalten k nnen dennoch haben wir gute fortschritte gemacht und ich habe viel f r spanien und korsika gelernt daher war das f r uns eine durchaus positive geschichte
5010800 wir haben unseren nutzen aus diesem event gezogen und durch unsere asphalttechnik gute fortschritte gemacht au erdem haben wir einiges ber das setup und die pirelli reifen gelernt ich bin nicht besonders zufrieden mit der anzahl meiner kleinen fehler wie abw rgen und dreher aber das wird uns k nftig helfen
5010801 wir haben hier wichtige nderungen an der aufh ngung vorgenommen was dem auto beim bremsen entgegenkam und mir mehr vertrauen gegeben hat
5010802 nach der entt uschung durch gigis ausfall ist doch noch ein traumergebnis dabei herausgekommen ein weiteres podium f r stobart
5010803 francois hat hier einen fantastischen job gemacht seine zuversicht und leistung haben im laufe der rallye immer mehr zugenommen das wird den weiteren veranstaltungen in diesem jahr zugute kommen au erdem hat henning sein bestes asphalt ergebnis eingefahren und matts zeiten haben sich gut entwickelt das hat beiden weitere gute erfahrungen f r spanien und korsika beschert
5010804 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5010805 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5010806 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5010807 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5010808 we have principles in journalism that dont allow us to put stuff in the memory hole and pretend it never happened
5010809 the attack was short sharp and deadly enough to send the georgians fleeing in humiliating panic
5010810 the western media especially cnn is feeding you complete horseshit russia did not invade georgia first
5010811 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation

5010816 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5010817 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5010818 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years

5010820 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5010821 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5010822 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5010823 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5010824 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5010825 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5010826 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5010827 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5010828 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5010829 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5010830 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5010831 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5010832 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5010833 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

5010841 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
5010842 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
5010843 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5010844 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5010845 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5010846 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5010847 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5010848 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5010849 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5010850 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

5010858 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5010859 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5010860 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you

5010870 authors just dont send manuscripts to the publisher dear darnell
5010871 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5010872 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5010873 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5010874 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5010875 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5010876 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5010877 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5010878 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5010879 who are open to doing something on the production side
5010880 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5010881 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5010882 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5010883 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5010884 nadie debe hacerse el ingenuo por lo que ocurre en caracas la dignidad de los candidatos debe ser respetada
5010885 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5010886 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5010887 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5010888 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5010889 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5010890 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5010891 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5010892 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5010893 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5010894 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5010895 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5010896 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5010897 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5010898 omg this house rules im nice i pay my rent on time and ill look after it honest my daughter loves it too oh pleasepleaseplease let us live there please
5010899 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5010900 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5010901 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5010902 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5010903 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5010904 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

5010908 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5010909 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5010910 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5010911 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5010912 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5010913 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5010914 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5010915 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5010916 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5010917 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5010918 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5010919 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5010920 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5010921 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5010922 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5010923 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5010924 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word

5010931 back to school reception and happy hour with the faculty
5010932 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5010933 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5010934 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5010935 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5010936 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5010937 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5010938 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5010939 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5010940 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5010941 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5010942 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5010943 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5010944 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5010945 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5010946 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5010947 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5010948 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5010949 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5010950 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5010951 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5010952 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5010953 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5010954 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5010955 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5010956 i have dreamed of a lot of things and i have written down a lot of goals and this was the biggest one i really ever wrote down and everything was accomplished it has been a fun last four years and it has been one fun week that is for sure
5010957 getting to know everybody on the team is one of the greatest memories just being able to be a part of team usa and be a part of the u s olympic swimming team
5010958 that is one of the greatest memories i will have from this
5010959 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5010960 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5010961 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5010962 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5010963 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5010964 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5010965 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5010966 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5010967 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5010968 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5010969 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5010970 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5010971 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5010972 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5010973 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5010974 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5010975 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5010976 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5010977 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis

5010979 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5011176 it is entirely wrong to suggest simon cawte was not paid in accordance with the rules
5011177 simon cawte was employed to support caroline spelman in her role as part of the official opposition in parliament
5011178 he discharged duties such as speech writing and answering correspondence relating to caroline spelmans role as the shadow local governmet secretary this is entirely within the rules
5011179 one aircraft came down close to coventry road between brinklow and coventry one person was confirmed dead at the scene the second came down in brandon woods four people were confirmed dead at the scene
5011180 the collision occurred near to coombe abbey country park at about 11 30am on sunday august 17
5011181 it involved a cessna 407 and a light aircraft which are believed to have collided mid air
5011182 there are two sites where debris from the aircrafts has landed which stretches across several miles
5011183 it is our intention to show at trial that mr nugent caused the death of baron pikes by tasing him multiple times unnecessarily and in violation of louisiana law and by failing to get him medical attention when it was apparent he needed it
5011184 in a civilized society abuse by those who are given great authority cannot be tolerated
5011185 tasers are marketed as being non lethal the science will show that the taser deployment itself did not cause the death
5011186 if it was a regular civilian he would be charged and locked up by now he shouldnt be treated any different because he is an officer
5011187 i was born and raised in winnfield and nothing they do there surprises me but its time for a change
5011188 im just trying to make it through i am trying to hold up
5011189 they are pleased that the officer is being formally charged
5011190 this means that a grand jury in winn parish that probably was majority white decided there was enough evidence to bring charges
5011191 most of those surveyed in germany spain france britain and australia think china either has already replaced the u s or will do so in the future

5011195 impeachment is the first of two stages in a specific process for a legislative body to forcibly remove a government official the second stage is conviction

5011197 with the political ripples now in mindanao we see the solidarity ring as a good statement on how our once divided leaders set aside differences and helped in creating this wonderful piece of jewel
5011198 transporting the ring out of compostela valley and sharing its beauty with other areas are worth the risks
5011199 its creation as an icon of unity would not be justified if it would not go out of compostela valley and be displayed to other places
5011200 the governor wanted to strengthen the ties between the two local governments so he wrote a letter to the mayor about his desire to bring the ring to the city
5011201 visitors clamored for the real stuff thus the provincial government decided to bring the real ring
5011202 i am saddened that instead of moving forward after 25 years it seems that the country has moved backward
5011203 are offering themselves to the altar of money and power
5011204 had hoped that choosing the difficult right over the convenient wrong would be easier almost instinctive or even unnecessary however it saddens me to find that this has not been the case so far
5011205 well i am not really as strong as i was
5011206 it is heartwarming to know that the people still continue to remember ninoy
5011207 somebody who really loved the filipino people and proved it by giving up his life for our freedom and for our democracy
5011208 we have seen the proliferation of nongovernmental organizations there are many groups helping our people through microfinance
5011209 i hope that all of us filipinos will think how we can help our fellow filipinos
5011210 the sacrifice of ninoy aquino redeemed us ninoys death was our redemption
5011211 my position is always to have a constitutional convention in 2010 so that the issues can be extensively discussed
5011212 my advice was to postpone very divisive and to have con con by electing delegates during the elections let it go until 2010
5011213 i want a charter that is really reflective of the people and suited for what we are today
5011214 what would stop other groups from calling for the same its a bad precedent
5011215 she was exploring the possibility of federalism under the proposal of senator pimentel
5011216 i am confident and i have no doubts that she will end her term in 2010
5011217 they were deployed there for some post elections duties and nothing else
5011218 this way we can gain the trust and confidence of our people especially those in remote villages
5011219 it appears that there are now guns for hire operating in dumaguete
5011220 its immaterial whether you are in bacong dumaguete or wherever we have to find out why they were killed
5011221 i dont want to say the situation is beyond control or alarming but we have to take a closer look at why this is happening in dumaguete
5011222 on my own i have given about 80 handheld radios to the police to improve their communications police visibility has been increased and the city is buying two motorcycles for the police
5011223 this project is meant to ensure the power supply reliability on the island and to minimize brownouts and fluctuations
5011224 the price of fuel is very high and this would mean additional expenses for business operators
5011225 the longer the project takes the bigger the costs to business operators
5011226 we have to live with it because its also for the good of the island once the project is completed hopefully it will be completed as scheduled before the peak season starts in october

5011234 im just praying for the gwatney family its just beyond belief a horribly sad sad state of affairs
5011235 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time
5011236 he was a long time friend of mine a caring compassionate individual with strong convictions who worked hard every day
5011237 its just senseless senseless he meant a lot to me and i talked to him and visited with him as late as thursday he was a visionary always looking forward a great guy i cant say enough about him he was a dear friend
5011238 we had two different service projects that included building a porch for a lady that lived there we tore down an old barn that was there for 60 years and we didnt use bulldozers or anything that was all the bare hands of a handful of youth
5011239 overall it was just to go to cincinnati and let the presence of the lord be felt by using the youth in whatever service project or vacation bible school whatever we could do to reach out and share the love of christ
5011240 you can quote me on this the most positive group of students and adults i have ever taken on a mission trip
5011241 the spirit of that team was just amazing i never heard anyone complain
5011242 taken into account where we slept we didnt have a motel just air mattresses and cots we were all there together
5011243 ive been doing this ministry for 14 years and i dont think ive ever had a trip where there wasnt just some complaining going on
5011244 the places where we had the backyard bible clubs were government housing they didnt look as needy as some of the other projects they had done but nonetheless it was definitely government housing
5011245 it was our first time in cincinnati but we do take a mission trip every year
5011246 usually its to a different spot but we do the same thing vacation bible school backyard bible clubs weve been to arizona before weve been to pennsylvania its just wherever god leads us where work needs to be done thats where we go
5011247 normally people drop kids off at vacation bible school but these parents would stay there and watch
5011248 at first it was kind of unnerving but after we got back on the bus the last day a lot of the adult leaders told us the parents didnt know a lot about vacation bible school and they wanted to see how we were being effective with their kids it was just really cool to see they wanted to be there to learn how to go about witnessing to little kids
5011249 my favorite part of that was when we were almost done
5011250 the lady that we were doing it for told us how thankful she was that we had come all the way from arkansas to tear down her barn it was just a blessing to me to see how god used us to bring joy to her life
5011251 them being able to use that passion for basketball to help to shape the life of a child especially for christ to me that scenario played out over and over throughout the week
5011252 its not just about going a week to cincinnati its about living for jesus everyday i hope thats what people came away with
5011253 its a big investment of their time when you think about it its kind of heroic

5011256 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration
5011257 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered
5011258 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5011259 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5011260 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
5011261 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5011262 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5011263 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5011264 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5011265 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5011266 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5011267 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5011268 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5011269 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5011270 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5011271 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5011272 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5011273 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5011274 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5011275 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5011276 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5011277 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5011278 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile

5011377 after reading your article this morning i wished i felt more compassionate but was instead frustrated and dumbfounded by the debt that family took on which was well beyond their means
5011378 the size of the mortgage 190 000 was astronomical relative to their income cunniff added
5011379 borrowers need to be realistic about their earning ability and be conservative in their estimation of what they can afford a skill which seems to be sorely missing in this mortgage debacle
5011380 they bought into the american dream whether they could afford it or not
5011381 with the cost of just about everything in this country on the rise more and more middle class americans become poor vicek wrote
5011382 americans care more about what a celebrity is wearing than they do about the marines that have died in combat politician s no longer represent the american people they represent corporate america i pray that this country can be helped and get back to the way it was meant to be for the people by the people not for the rich by the rich
5011383 i can relate all too well to their situation as can countless other americans too many times i have felt the same shame and guilt as my family struggles to survive in our trying times
5011384 is anyone really prepared or willing to do anything to fix this broken nation
5011385 not likely too busy mudslinging or stroking egos i know it sounds apathetic but that is what has become of the american dream for many
5011386 we have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence
5011387 people who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made

5011391 its extremely important to have the same common toyota way infiltrated to employees in all corners of the world
5011392 but on the other hand in each corner of the world in each region there are inherent characteristics that need to be respected
5011393 as a global company there are many many things i believe toyota has to do
5011394 we cannot go back to what we were in the past
5011395 what took us 20 years is now concentrated down to 5 years
5011396 this is about a greater maturity about globalizing and transferring knowledge that toyota certainly has at this point
5011397 really is a natural progression as the world has become smaller and products are being sold in a lot more places than they used to be

5011404 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5011405 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5011406 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5011407 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5011408 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5011409 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5011410 this looks frankly to me more like decisions made by the prime minister than by the president
5011411 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5011412 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5011413 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5011414 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5011415 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5011416 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric and probably fairly empty rhetoric
5011417 the truth of the matter is russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody the poles know that we know it
5011418 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since aug 7
5011419 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable
5011420 but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual the company is cooperating fully with ongoing investigations and believes that accountability is important

5011457 if you have a new idea how much bureaucracy do you have to go through to get a small increment of experimental capital how long is it going to take you to get 20 percent of your time and 5 000 to test your idea is that a matter of months or is it very easy for that to happen
5011458 are you actually being measured on your innovation performance or your teams innovation does it influence your compensation
5011459 as you look at the management processes in your company do they tend to help you work as an innovator or get in the way

5011486 i think its very much worthwhile to have given russia that chance
5011487 now i think the behavior recently suggests that perhaps russia has not taken that route or that they would like to have it both ways that is that you behave in a 1968 way toward your neighbors by invading them and at the same time you continue to integrate into the political and diplomatic and economic and security structures of the international community and i think the fact is you cant have it both ways

5011556 the us has for several years now mishandled the situation in georgia
5011557 the way that mikheil saakashvili has approached this has been by thinking that he could be an extension of the west a partner of the united states
5011558 in many ways we have given him cause for thinking that with the many visits to the united states the talk of georgia as a beacon for democracy
5011559 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
5011560 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
5011561 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
5011562 underlying all this is a larger more significant contest a geopolitical struggle between russia and the west over the export of caspian sea oil and natural gas
5011563 the united states seeks to use georgia as an energy corridor to transport caspian energy to the west without going through iran or russia to this end it helped build the btc pipeline across georgia and helped beef up the georgian military to protect it
5011564 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder

5011598 it is impossible to attain any happiness without conquering ones nature
5011599 as for nation building feminism has disrupted the sole unit the family unit by which a country depends on for population increase feminism has introduced confusion into the family unit by confusing gender roles it compels women to take on the role of the man and forces men to increasingly take on the role of the woman because of this women feel that they are less of a woman if they are dispossessed of a career or meaningful work leaving them with less time and sometimes even less care for child bearing and rearing to be blunt feminism has debased motherhood to notions of slavery and sub human status

5011602 afghanistan has to try to have good relations with you but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
5011603 therefore you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5011604 the canadian people have to realize if their sisters their brothers and their children are being killed in afghanistan it is because of the wrong policy of the government of canada and their falling under the influence of others when they sent occupation soldiers to afghanistan
5011605 the canadian people when they express condolences for the death of two canadian women in logar in afghanistan and consider themselves grieved they have to know that the canadian forces under american command handicap tens among the afghan people every day to this kind of condolence and they kill in addition to men numbers of women and children as well

5011615 i was so cross i didnt sign anything saying they could be examined or interrogated they even asked them if they had been raped

5011631 t ake into consideration all earnings and income of the non custodial parent
5011632 i t is settled that section 659 a does not directly expose ssi benefits whether paid or unpaid to legal process as the entitlement to ssi benefits is not based on remuneration for employment
5011633 the entitlement to which is based upon remuneration for employment
5011634 provide reasonable and adequate compensation for disabled veterans and their families
5011635 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest that beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mount isa
5011636 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5011637 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are unhappy with their lot some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
5011638 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women
5011639 im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5011640 its not councils view and its not mine its hard when youve got to defend something someone else has said were definitely appalled
5011641 its a public attack on women and a form of verbal and emotional abuse
5011642 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting if he wants to come and visit our service im more than happy to have a yarn to him about what hes saying
5011643 theyre very archaic comments i dont think he realises the repercussions of labelling women based solely on their looks
5011644 the article didnt paint a very good picture of the men here either but ive never been treated with anything but the utmost respect ive never walked into a club and been preyed upon theyve been lovely
5011645 my views on what a woman should be like are irrelevant to you so your views on what a man should be like are irrelevant to me
5011646 it is a memorable day in my life after spending 30 years in cine field i have decided to enter politics in response to the call from all sections of people from here onwards i am dedicating my life to serve people
5011647 i am donning a new role i cant act in this role in this new role i have to live for others and this gives a satisfaction to me
5011648 i consider it as a blessing from god i am fortunate to get this opportunity few have got this opportunity i take it as my responsibility
5011649 he never had any criminal record he never smoked he drank occasionally weve done our best to raise him and it paid off he was a very good son
5011650 hes obviously walked into something person or persons and a savage and brutal and cowardly attack occurred just at the intersection of kidman street near brook street
5011651 he was basically left in a grave condition on the footpath
5011652 he was a great son and hopefully he will remain one
5011653 i came that they may have life and have it abundantly
5011654 the word is near you in your mouth and in your heart
5011655 everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame
5011656 that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody laugh
5011657 jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think i have ever met
5011658 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5011659 um alem o esteve aqui e me contatou pelo site para procurarmos alguns juntos ele diz que j achou mais de 2 000

5011661 the war was won by republicans as well as by democrats
5011662 there is a possibility of heavy rainfall or thundershowers in the next 24 hours
5011663 all my plans for the evening are shattered with this rain maybe now we will sit at home and settle for tea and snacks
5011664 thank god its sunday otherwise this rain would have again led to very heavy traffic snarls like i faced last week when i reached home after three hours instead of one
5011665 the situation is better as it is raining in only some parts of the city whereas last week rain had made the traffic crawl on the delhi gurgaon expressway it took me three hours to reach the india gate from gurgaon
5011666 if the situation continues the way it is and if unbridled use of force by police is done against agitators like in kashmir i will have no option but to resign from the parliament and i will do it
5011667 we have focused our efforts on responding to the great feedback weve received from our users
5011668 over the next several weeks we will be preparing a release candidate of the new version and creating good documentation for users and developers
5011669 when you have one price for men and one price for women thats clearly discrimination clearly sex discrimination
5011670 if you have a place of public accommodations whether it is a casino nightclub strip club health club all those places have to obey the law
5011671 its just simply not illegal but merely against state public policy to discriminate in public accommodations based on sex or sexual orientation
5011672 public policy is the law the policy under which i am suing is nrs 233 a statute is a law is a law is a law
5011673 the states public accommodation statute does not prohibit different cover charges on the basis of gender and never intended to prohibit such practices as ladies nights
5011674 men have to respect women but women have no reason to respect men
5011675 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good
5011676 fred loved his family he loved his son and he loved his fiancee
5011677 we have a number of witnesses and a number of persons assisting us with our inquiries
5011678 by releasing this reward we aim to encourage in particular a specific caller who rang crime stoppers in 1994 and provided specific and detailed information regarding the identity of freds killer how he was killed and the location of where fred was killed
5011679 i urge that caller to call back knowing what we do now this has increased the significance of this callers information from 1994
5011680 in all of these matters there is always somebody that has not told the whole story of what they know
5011681 this caller could hold the key to finally solving this case and providing an answer for the family
5011682 theres a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back to its past rather than its future
5011683 the fact is we have worked hard to bring them the russians into the community of nations we thought they were headed in that direction
5011684 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5011685 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5011686 will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards
5011687 we hope our republican colleagues will join in a bipartisan effort not only to increase domestic supply but also to help consumers and to protect the environment
5011688 if speaker pelosi and her democratic colleagues were truly serious about increasing production of american energy and lowering the price of gasoline they would call congress back into session immediately to vote on our all of the above energy plan rather than taking a five week break away from washington
5011689 another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
5011690 we are going to put them to the test on this issue
5011691 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them
5011692 i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
5011693 they are doing well but they still need a lot of care
5011694 what they need most is a dwelling to live in i hope the government will give them an apartment
5011695 with the help of allah they will make it but i think it will be difficult
5011696 what he did was and still is an amazing feat and will always be an amazing accomplishment for the swimming world and also the olympics
5011697 ive said it all along i want to be the first michael phelps not a second mark spitz
5011698 every moment that ive had so far in and out of the pool will be with me forever
5011699 this has been one of the greatest weeks of my life if not the greatest
5011700 laura and i are proud of you our family is proud of you but most importantly america is proud of you were excited for you you handled yourself with humility give your mom a big hug for me 41 and i were honored to get a picture with her
5011701 records are always made to be broken no matter what they are
5011702 anybody can do anything that they set their mind to
5011703 there are some things that i still want to do
5011704 i want to raise the bar in the sport of swimming more its come a long way and i think it can go even farther
5011705 lets hype things up win a few things leading up to it win in the beginning and just when everyone is behind us lose
5011706 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5011707 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
5011708 its unbelievable for me this is the best moment in my career ill never forget it
5011709 it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister
5011710 to serve you have to push yourself up to jump up and when the legs are a little bit slow it just doesnt go
5011711 who would dare follow that possibly the best show theres been on cab
5011712 yes neil can hold his own against such a challenge
5011713 its great to look around and see the other dramas from various networks
5011714 theyre competition but in the broader sense its great to see a lively drama industry out there rather than doom and gloom
5011715 every time degeneres and de rossi visit de rossis family in australia their rights protections and status as a married couple will cease to exist
5011716 i am shocked i have undergone more testing than anyone else
5011717 i cant believe it the first thing i thought of doing was to give all the nutritional supplements i have consumed my vitamins for testing
5011718 our contact with matter is just like a dream actually we are not fallen therefore because we are not fallen at any moment we can revive our krishna consciousness and we break the dream
5011719 hallo ja ik heb een uurtje over dus kan ik mooi even een paar tegels leggen toch
5011720 morgen komen we de rest doen en gaan we ook de wandtegels doen
5011721 i think after 9 11 my friends we should have told americans to join the peace corps expand the military serve a cause greater than your self interest
5011722 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5011723 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class
5011724 i have to tell you up front both of these guys are my friends they both care deeply about america they are both patriots
5011725 they have very different ideas on how america can be strengthened
5011726 i was so obsessed with me and the reasons i might be dissatisfied i couldnt focus on other people
5011727 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5011728 means im saved and forgiven our faith encompasses not just america but the world
5011729 for a minute there we were just two christians worshipping together
5011730 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation
5011731 this nomination should be based on the criteria on a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution and not legislating from the bench
5011732 they achieved a revolution now the russians are coming in there in an act of aggression we have to not only bring about cease fire we have to have honor
5011733 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
5011734 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5011735 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
5011736 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
5011737 solving big problems are not going to be easy we are all going to think about how we using things energy wise if we pretend like everything is free we are betraying the tradition of america
5011738 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
5011739 a lot of patients wont go out because they are embarrassed by those movements suppressing the movement means a lot to people with huntingtons disease

5011763 wir k nnen nicht zufrieden sein unser ziel war das viertelfinale wir haben die beste leistung leider zu sp t gebracht
5011764 wir hatten uns mehr vorgenommen als nur dabei zu sein im endeffekt war der selbst auferlegte druck zu gro wir sind lediglich an nuancen gescheitert

5011773 it depends on form at this moment i have to check the form of the players but experimentation is finished now
5011774 my objective is to win the qualification games i am focused only on that
5011775 i think if you can play and train everyday it is easy to change the mentality in every moment during training and different work
5011776 i have to transfer the mentality of the clubs into the national team because i think you have to play with the same spirit that they play with for their clubs
5011777 but i saw some games during the qualification and they played very well with spirit and in two or three games they won the games with israel and russia at wembley
5011778 a good third of the regional banks wont make it

5011785 it is amazing to go to three olympics and get three medals

5011790 its better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal
5011791 they really had us under the pump in the first half
5011792 we came out after half time and locked them down a bit defensively and that allowed us to get our running game going
5011793 i dont know what to say im a bit emotional
5011794 we needed to win that game so badly when you look up there and you are 20 points down and all of a sudden your dream is just slipping away something just clicks in
5011795 we have to start playing well for the whole 40 minutes
5011796 good luck and i hope you get your 100 next week

5011826 hes not a giant i think hes about 6ft 3in 6ft 4in but what he did have was tremendous physical strength which you obviously need for the sport
5011827 but he also had tremendous stamina he was a very good cross country runner as a youngster and then when he got a bit older he started weight training
5011828 canada were always going to be a tough act to bear but our guys got the silver and i think theres been many years in the olympics when medals have been less frequently won

5011838 council failed to provide adequate reasons to justify its decision
5011839 such failure constitutes unreasonable administrative action within the meaning of the ombudsman act
5011840 we need to determine whether councils complaints process provides a fair system for managing complaints about large projects
5011841 ive certainly asked for some work to be done on what the possible costs might be and what sort of assistance we might be able to provide
5011842 we would support any effort that was made to find the wreck but we would want to make sure it was protected and left alone as a war grave
5011843 we are just a small organisation we need some government leadership on this issue
5011844 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest that beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mount isa
5011845 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5011846 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are unhappy with their lot some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
5011847 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women
5011848 im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5011849 its not councils view and its not mine its hard when youve got to defend something someone else has said were definitely appalled
5011850 its a public attack on women and a form of verbal and emotional abuse
5011851 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting if he wants to come and visit our service im more than happy to have a yarn to him about what hes saying
5011852 theyre very archaic comments i dont think he realises the repercussions of labelling women based solely on their looks
5011853 the article didnt paint a very good picture of the men here either but ive never been treated with anything but the utmost respect ive never walked into a club and been preyed upon theyve been lovely

5012122 rick ross orchestrated a brutal attack upon dj vlad carried out at his direction by his accomplices in retribution for media coverage of rick ross prior life as a correctional officer
5012123 he has shown he is an intelligent player he has good technique and can integrate well with the team
5012124 he added something that people wanted from him in france and that was to score goals
5012125 he started to score some goals towards the end of last season and had a scoring start here today
5012126 we made a good start were always in control but could not finish the game off
5012127 you have that old story in the game when you cannot finish the game off you feel you deserved to be punished when theres 10 minutes to go
5012128 i am pleased with the fact that we didnt concede a goal we scored two on wednesday one today so its better than the reverse

5012142 if we continue playing like this we are going to be in a little bit of trouble
5012143 next week collingwood down there we havent played that well against them its like a mini final really
5012144 weve got to really win this game to keep in the finals
5012145 we played periods of good footy weve got some players who arent in great form at the moment which makes it hard
5012146 theyve got 22 guys who are prepared to tackle and chase and do all the hard things
5012147 i thought paul bevans consistency over four quarters hes one that really stands out
5012148 hes hungry hes a young kid who has a lot of desire hes a really good competitor he has a good pedigree in terms of his rugby league background
5012149 hes a really good kid and he wants to compete every week and thats the trick in afl footy
5012150 we threw him on gary ablett jr in the last quarter when he had 28 touches up to three quarter time and finished with 32
5012151 i really dont know we have tried to address a few things and it just hasnt worked
5012152 its hard for the springboks now to win hence their likely response as a result of today
5012153 they are the world champions and there is no way they will be excited about contemplating another loss
5012154 without a doubt the springboks wont want to suffer again at home and they are playing at one of their favourite destinations at kings park
5012155 the boks did bring a lot of pressure to bear and it looked like on occasions that scoring was inevitable
5012156 being an observer and being in the arena it was very evident that any side that enters a tri nations fixture that is not at full noise is just going to get belted
5012157 it amp squo s hard for the springboks now to win hence their likely response as a result of today
5012158 i dont know i might be a bit off the mark but i dont see in them the same star quality as a makybe diva or a sunline
5012159 i know i might be a bit out of step in saying that and they might look better on top of the ground but thats my feeling
5012160 it certainly was a good result for me on saturday
5012161 i havent sat down and analysed the race fully yet but the better horse on the day won
5012162 it was a great clash i didnt think there was much between them and the result didnt particularly surprise me i made quite a lot of that 400 000 by taking them in the trifecta
5012163 there is a lot of media hype about this horse but im not convinced he is as good as everyone believes
5012164 everyone seems to have gone a bit hussler mad hes a very good horse but i dont believe he should be compared with the greats like kingston town
5012165 weekend hussler fans wont take too much notice of that run and will continue to support him through the spring
5012166 he pulled up in a very grumpy mood this morning and felt hed had a hard run
5012167 hes not very happy with life but he ate up well and is very sound he got a bit of mud in his throat we scoped him yesterday and hell be fine
5012168 it gives me an extra week to get over that run
5012169 i don amp squo t know i might be a bit off the mark but i don amp squo t see in them the same star quality as a makybe diva or a sunline
5012170 we dont like what happened on saturday and its unacceptable
5012171 we will be looking into the matter and waiting on the police report from what weve been told there was an altercation between two small groups but police were quick to move and ejected 16 people
5012172 this was only a minority and we do have a policy in place where if you disrupt the enjoyment of others you will be ejected from the venue and possibly banned from attending future a league matches
5012173 we believe we should focus on what happens on the field rather than off it
5012174 we had several phone conversations with all parties and took every practical step to avoid any problems between the supporters
5012175 well review the matter but we usually review most things as its part of the normal process
5012176 without stoner amp squo s fall i probably wouldn amp squo t have won
5012177 the speed and weight of money behind this move has been quite breathtaking
5012178 commodity booms end ugly they always do and there has never been an exception
5012179 its like starting all over again i had some feelings i havent felt in 17 years i had a lot of fun
5012180 i just stayed calm and had a great time out there
5012181 after the all around i was excited to have made the floor finals and a bronze medal feels great
5012182 today i concentrated only on my moves not the medals
5012183 i felt that i had a very normal performance without surprises and that is why i got a silver medal
5012184 im disappointed especially since third place had a fall and i made both of mine

5012190 brisbane is unique weve got the largest amount of clubs in one area we cater for everyone
5012191 brisbane has such a wealth of venues in such a small area
5012192 locally we are very diverse but you look nationally and we are still behind the eight ball especially with our dance music education
5012193 we are doing fine in brisbane we are moving as fast as our crowds want us to
5012194 contrary to peoples perceptions we are actually very forward thinking with the music offerings in brisbane even compared to the much larger and established markets down south
5012195 there is a mainstream commercial element that comes in to play and the majority of people that head out to dance still want to hear those songs that they know
5012196 but if you like a certain type of music no matter what it is i guarantee youll find a club or bar that will play that music in brisbane sometimes you just have to look a bit harder
5012197 the dance scene has changed dramatically thanks to the internet and online record stores theres no longer a delay so brisbane is right there receiving things the same time as london and new york and clubbers are expecting the best music all of the time
5012198 this generation is embracing dance music a lot younger we are finding 18 year olds are much more knowledgeable and they are wanting more than the top 40
5012199 people are attracted by the whole party atmosphere as well as the music
5012200 its not just about the music any more they are looking for an experience
5012201 i was petrified i started sweating heavily and shaking my mind was racing and i could hear a loud thumping noise like someone banging a big drum i couldnt work it out then i realised it was my heart
5012202 exhausted emotionally vulnerable isolated and far from home i was ready for the taking
5012203 for a moment i was convinced i was dying i knew i was in serious trouble i had to get help
5012204 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave it sucked the breath clean out of my lungs the next 48 hours were hell
5012205 i started thinking seriously about doing myself harm i knew i didnt want to carry on living like this
5012206 it was as though someone flicked a switch i knew it was over the tears welled up as i started to walk back to the pavilion
5012207 i knew i no longer had any say in the matter the illness had come back the thought of what i was doing hit me like a kick in the guts i would probably never again experience the great highs hard work and joy of playing for england

5012211 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it
5012212 it takes huge sums of money to make a star
5012213 i think theres still a certain amount of prestige with being on a label
5012214 bands arent as gung ho about majors as they used to be indie labels are a lot more attractive and can do a lot of the same things majors can do
5012215 we all dream of being signed to a major label and having major distribution and all the corporate money behind you
5012216 it doesnt seem so glorious when you hear these things
5012217 theres something to be said about building your own career on your own its nice to know its possible
5012218 this is how i wrote the record this is what it is
5012219 but you just have to decide to move forward even though its hard without getting more attention
5012220 in one way its not so much the transition from physical to digital as the transition from pay for to free
5012221 the question is for a great swathe of the population mainly youngsters is it too late the notion of paying for music
5012222 i think some of the indie labels will figure this out first and will become as big as some of the majors
5012223 but i dont know if anyone noticed it then the music content i was creating was ahead of the curve no one knew how to categorize it out of self defense i had to start my own label i knew once people heard the music they would like it
5012224 i had this music and had a label but how do you get anybody to pay attention to it we lucked out in the end by hooking up with the hi fi business but thats when there were big hi fi stores
5012225 youve gotta have product youve gotta be ready to go

5012227 we can own them and license them for use in tv film commercials without having to share 50 percent of the master licensing with the a label
5012228 no one ever talks to use about moving release dates or making songs radio friendly
5012229 no one pressures joe into touring which he really doesnt much like to do these days we have only ourselves to blame for any mistakes made or opportunities missed
5012230 we both walk away with a sum equal to what wed earn at a nice part time job in retail
5012231 neither of us is doing this full time were middle aged and dont want to live hand to mouth anymore which being a full time rock musician would require
5012232 i dont really care about being on a major label
5012233 they just sign cookie cutter bands that use the same formulas theyre just copying from each other and its so boring
5012234 we saw the tumbleweeds rolling through and decided it was time
5012235 everyone is necessarily the hero of his own life story

5012245 all we could find was pictures from back in the 1950s i couldnt get anything current
5012246 its my opportunity to go and do something for my country its a golden opportunity to put wrenches in their hands instead of machine guns
5012247 a lot of their tools are broken or way outdated
5012248 a lot of what well be doing is showing them a safe way to build so theres less fatalities and less injuries
5012249 it allows us to have the opportunity to bring them into the new age
5012250 i have two daughters and have raised them on my own
5012251 armstrong is the kind of role model i want them to have
5012252 that will mean riding my bike in the park a lot

5012257 i appreciate the organization for moving me if they werent going to have a significant role for me in the last year of my contract at the same time im upset they werent able to find a role for me
5012258 i think john mccains reaction to what happened in russia did not reflect well on the position he should have taken
5012259 and that is one of understanding we have one president in this country and that secretary of state rice and president bush need the support of both presidential candidates in a very tricky time as it relates to russia and the neighboring states that are trying to establish democracies
5012260 hillary clinton is not the enemy hillary clinton and barack obama are working together on making this a great convention where we can talk about changing this country
5012261 people have been trying to upset what we are trying to achieve at blackburn even before my first season as a manager in the top flight had even started but that has been dispelled by this result
5012262 it hasnt upset me nothing upsets me things annoy me but dont upset me
5012263 it wasnt only because of what was being said about myself because i have dealt with a load of crap throughout my career just the way it tried to unsettle what i was trying to achieve
5012264 and for someone facing his first job in the premier league it was wrong attempts were made to upset things before things had even started
5012265 the season had not even started and things were being said that were bang out of order
5012266 there seemed to be an attempt to unsettle myself the players and the staff we have a good bunch of lads and we have stayed strong people could see that against everton
5012267 do i know the source of what was said no i dont but it was wrong and it was out of order
5012268 i was a bit unsure what to expect i have played in the premier league for a long time and know what is about but as a manager i was unsure
5012269 it was an eye opener for me i was happy with three points and the experience of being a manager in the top flight was tremendous
5012270 it was a deserved victory no doubt we were a bit sloppy and disappointed after the break having been hit by a very late sucker punch with their equaliser
5012271 but we needed to salvage something and did that very well we were 2 1 down to a team that finished fifth last season and nobody outside the top four won at everton last term
5012272 it showed what spirit and togetherness we have at this club i was very pleased with what i saw and the win
5012273 it was nice but we always had confidence there has been a lot of crap spouted about things that are supposedly going on at blackburn there has been attempts to unsettle my players
5012274 we worked hard to get back into the game and then go ahead then expected the experienced defenders we had to make sure that was how it remained but they did not do that
5012275 it is a lot to ask a 16 year old to come on and change a game but we have a history of that at everton with wayne rooney and james vaughan
5012276 the two lads we did put on rodwell and baxter did really well and we are very pleased with them
5012277 but it is not the right time to be playing either of them we would rather use them coming into a side that is playing well and winning
5012278 these boys need time to develop sometimes though the first team is where that happens
5012279 there was a lot of pressure on jose when he came on and he did get a big build up but maybe everton fans need something to cheer and support
5012280 everton fans needed some good news and at the moment that is rodwell and baxter we hope they have the mentality to cope we will do our best to protect them and use them at the right moments
5012281 it probably wasnt the right moment this time but we had little choice nevertheless they got on and showed what they can do and this can help their future development

5012287 expect to find 20 big screen tvs a draft beer system featuring at least 15 to 20 specialty drafts and local brews as well as a radio transmission area where golic can do live broadcasts
5012288 ive seen him up in the zone a lot more with everything and because of that his secondary stuff is not playing
5012289 well have to re evaluate him and see how we can get him going again
5012290 ya know jhonny i liked you so much better when you were just a ballplayer if you wanna be an interior decorator now thats none of my business but some of us still need this team now you listen to me this is my last shot at a winner and for some of the younger guys it could be their only shot i dont know what happened to you but if you ever ever tank another play like you did today im gonna cut your off and stuff em down your throat
5012291 no one will talk on the record about any potential move of tribe prospects from buffalo to columbus
5012292 the process has been outlined well go through september and then people will talk
5012293 but i would have my head in the sand to think there arent some back channel things going on
5012294 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5012295 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5012296 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5012297 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5012298 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5012299 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission

5012318 and yes i think that pretty much qualifies for a religious test sorry mitt no vp for you mccain is at warrens church because he needs to be there having a radically deformed view of what our founding fathers had in mind for religion is a pretty dominant characteristic of the group of people he needs the most i get this and i dont fault him for showing up where his base is important pronouncement by a democrat on faith and politics since john f kennedys houston speech in 1960 declaring his independence from the vatican

5012330 ay or more than we should seek after for we know enough if we know we are the kings subjects if his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us
5012331 but if the cause be not good the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in a battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all we died at such a place some swearing some crying for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left i am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle for how can they charitably dispose of anything when blood is their argument now if these men do not die well it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection

5012337 its everywhere its europe its australia its asia japan contracted and china is slowing their growth rate may still be over eight per cent next year too but they are such a highly leveraged economy in terms of the need to pump out tons of stuff to feed people and a slowdown from 10 to eight or nine for them is catastrophic
5012338 all i was trying to say to people before was its not true that demand is driving commodity prices and the dollar right now
5012339 people didnt want to believe that because it meant that parabolic spikes could continue indefinitely prices could go to the sky and all that
5012340 the fact of the matter was that its a typical scenario just like in the tech run when you had big gains attracting big dollars people chasing and then you have the self fulfilling momentum of things going up because people are getting long just because

5012354 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5012355 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5012356 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5012357 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5012358 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5012359 i made the best decision regardless of what hardships i go through i could have put iraqi families through more hardships i have no regrets
5012360 i support robin long because he is a soldier of conscience there is a huge propaganda campaign in this country to get young men to join the military he bought the hype he signed up for a promised non combat job but it turned out not to be so he decided to go to canada and follow his conscience instead

5012387 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it

5012391 he never imagined that a place like candaba existed in the philippines
5012392 in manila zoo youd see these birds in cages but not in candaba where over 90 species of migratory endemic and resident birds congregate
5012393 more than 11 000 birds and more than 80 species in candaba in only three hours of counting
5012394 the time of our visit was the peak of migration there were 11 000 birds in candaba he was surprised but also frustrated because we didnt bring a zoom lens for close up shots of the birds
5012395 he was brought in by his good friend and fellow cameraman rene de los santos when we decided to make a documentary on the birds of candaba
5012396 he wasted no time and put all his knowledge skills and even resources into our project
5012397 at first we were embarrassed because our organization lacked funds and we didnt have the money to pay a professional cameraman like him
5012398 he used his own video camcorder a canon xl1 when we shot for four days in candaba he had his personal computer upgraded so he could edit the documentary at home
5012399 we edited the docu for five days nonstop and without sleep it was during that time that we got to know ralph better
5012400 photo finish kami we finished editing and submitted the docu only three hours before the moonrise festivals deadline on june 30
5012401 because we were all first time filmmakers and we pulled it off

5012405 he took a break from editing to withdraw p35 000 from a metrobank branch in lagro quezon city he was going to lend the money to a friend
5012406 he was declared dead on arrival at the tala hospital

5012503 we fully support the mmr catch up campaign which initially focuses on children and young people aged 13 months to 18 years who have not had an mmr vaccine
5012504 vaccination rates are good in medway compared to other parts of the country with 76 per cent of children having had two mmr vaccinations by the age of four but not high enough to prevent a potential outbreak of measles
5012505 measles can be a very serious infection causing pneumonia and encephalitis and is sometimes fatal
5012506 we encourage parents to ensure their children are fully immunised against measles mumps and rubella
5012507 we fully support the department of health drive to ensure every child up to the age of 18 is vaccinated against measles
5012508 the health protection agency has highlighted a risk of a large measles outbreak of between 30 000 and 100 000 cases the majority in london
5012509 nhs west kents proximity to south east london makes this drive even more important and we will be working closely with gps across our area to ensure all parents with children who have not already been vaccinated have the opportunity now
5012510 the department of health is very clear that its own experts say parents who have not had their children vaccinated with the mmr vaccine should do so as soon as possible
5012511 the department also says the evidence on mmr is very clear there is no link between the vaccine and autism
5012512 the mmr vaccine take up rate is not high enough to cancel out the threat of a measles outbreak
5012513 measles is a serious illness and in some cases it can be fatal delaying immunisation puts children at risk

5012520 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight

5012526 in 2003 zijn we begonnen met de band smash the statues destijds nog in een iets andere bezetting dan nu datzelfde jaar hebben wij tevens onze demo opgenomen daarna hebben we veel shows gespeeld in 2005 hebben we ons album opgenomen vlak voor ons album uitkwam is onze toenmalige drummer gijs ermee opgehouden hij is vervangen door bert na het verschijnen van onze cd hebben we opnieuw veel opgetreden in 2006 is bassiste marloes wegens tijdgebrek gestopt vervolgens hebben we nico gevraagd om bij ons te komen bassen hij leek ons wel een aardige kerel en hij had ook al onze cd opgenomen dus hij was bekend met de muziek sinds nico bij de band zit is het allemaal beter gaan lopen met smash the statues we zijn meer shows gaan spelen ook in het buitenland zoals duitsland engeland noorwegen en slovenie
5012527 we hebben toen in duitsland zweden en noorwegen gespeeld een jaar of twee geleden ben ik in contact gekomen met micke hij speelde vroeger in adhesive een zweedse punkband dat is toch altijd een van mijn favouriete bands geweest pas toen die band uit elkaar was hebben we via myspace contact gelegd enige tijd later begon hij een nieuwe band the indecision alarm zij hebben in mei 2007 vier dagen in nederland gespeeld een week later zijn wij een paar dagen naar zweden geweest dit jaar zijn we opnieuw voor tien dagen die kant op gegaan ditmaal samen met antillectual een bevriende band
5012528 nee alles ging de eerste keer goed bij eerdere tours hebben we de bus van de moeder van nico geleend en deze hebben we elke keer kapot teruggebracht er was altijd wel wat we zijn zelfs een keer in de vangrail gereden zelf ben ik ook altijd goed in het doodrijden van konijnen en duiven dat compenseer ik weer door thuis geen vlees te eten
5012529 de tweede avond van de tour speelden we in neum nster in duitsland dat was op de vooravond van hitlers geboortedag die plaats staat bekend vanwege laten we zeggen de kaalkoppige inwoners
5012530 de week ervoor hadden locale antifascisten het honk van de aangevallen vandaar dat er wel wat spanning werd verwacht te meer omdat het jongerencentrum honderd meter van het nazihonk af lag tijdens ons concert zaten de nazis in een kroeg een blok verder om hitlers verjaardag te vieren
5012531 die kroeg heette de titanic over zinkende schepen gesproken bij onze slaapplekken was het wel wat onrustig daar waren wat rellen in de straat verder verliep de tour redeleijk relaxed wat wel matig is aan zweden is dat je bijna nergens wat te drinken krijgt bij shows je krijgt soms een glaasje fris en dat was het dan maar goed bier is ook behoorlijk duur daar dus we hebben thuis flink wat halve liters ingeslagen zodoende is het toch nog goed gekomen
5012532 ik was altijd degene die twee of drie bands ernaast had en nu heb ik voor het eerst helemaal niks alleen smash the statues
5012533 op dit moment heb ik een side project met onze nico killed for less we spelen een kruising tussen hardcore en rocknroll in killed for less zijn nico en ik van rol gewisseld hij speelt gitaar en ik bas
5012534 bert onze drummer speelt ook in de tenement kids zij spelen erg veel momenteel hij speelt ook in pkg een punkrockbandje wat al tien jaar bestaat maar eigenlijk bijna nooit optreedt
5012535 in augutus gaan we een weekje de studio in dan gaan we onze nieuwe cd opnemen we hopen de cd dan in november dit jaar uit te brengen
5012536 we zijn al een tijdje met ze in gesprek gert jan en fieke van het label zijn allebei erg betrokken bij de hardcore en punkscene dus het leek ons een goede keuze om met hen in zee te gaan
5012537 ik denk dat het lastiger is voor het publiek dan voor ons ik vind het gewoon leuk om een keer tijdens de vierdaagsefeesten te spelen ik hang er zelf ieder jaar rond dus het is gewoon te gek om daar dan zelf een keer te staan
5012538 er spelen ieder jaar wel punkbands vorig jaar speelde brat pack het jaar daarvoor antillectual en daarvoor the bips en bambix
5012539 voor ons is het gewoon erg leuk dat we voor een totaal ander publiek kunnen spelen als je in de onderbroek of merleyn speelt sta je toch iedere keer voor dezelfde gezichten nu we op het valkhof staan is de kans groot dat we voor veel mensen spelen die ons nog nooit hebben gezien
5012540 we waren eigenlijk bang dat we tussen wal en schip zouden vallen
5012541 we zaten in de kroeg en besloten weer een bandje te gaan beginnen we hebben een paar keer geoefend wat nummertjes geschreven en hebben toen onze demo opgenomen deze sloeg erg goed aan waarna we meer zijn gaan optreden
5012542 we zijn wel erg verbaasd dat we zoveel in nederland spelen toen we begonnen waren we een beetje bang dat we tussen wal en schip in zouden vallen je hebt in nederland hardcorepubliek en punkpubliek omdat wij toch een kruising hiertussen zijn waren we vooraf bang dat beide groepen onze muziek niet zouden oppikken
5012543 uiteindelijk pikken ze het juist allebei wel op hierdoor hebben we een twee keer zo groot publiek ik sta eigenlijk ook wel te kijken hoe goed onze demo is aangeslagen eigenlijk hebben we vanaf het begin veel optredens gehad
5012544 we hebben zelf ook tours geregeld en als band hebben wij er hard achteraan gezeten het is niet zo dat we helemaal niks hebben hoeven doen en ons alles is aangedragen
5012545 onze eerste gitarist willem speelt ook in antillectual omdat antillectueel erg goed bezig is kon hij beide bands eigenlijk niet meer combineren als hij met beide bands was doorgegaan wat hij waarschijnlijk graag zou hebben gedaan dan zouden beide bands daar waarschijnlijk onder lijden om die reden is hij er een half jaar geleden mee gestopt
5012546 jeroen is onze nieuwe gitarist hij speelt ook in frightening fiction hardcore en heeft ook lange tijd in all under age skatepunk gespeeld
5012547 we wilden zelf graag dat onze cd door verschillende labels uitgebracht zou worden zeg maar per gebied in europa een ander label we denken dat dit een betere distributie en promotie oplevert het nederlandse label crucial attack lag heel erg voor de hand we kennen labelbaas franke al langer en hij brengt hele leuke dingen uit met zijn label en hij werkt gewoon erg hard voor zijn bands
5012548 in duitsland zitten we op dirty faces toen ze onze opnames hoorden hebben ze deze drie dagen achter geluisterd in het voormalig joegoslavi zitten we op ha ko bastards op deze manier hopen wij toch in heel europa mensen te bereiken je hebt tegewoordig behalve reflections records weinig labels meer die heel europa nog dekken
5012549 we hebben nog bijna geen recensies gelezen van onze cd maar de paar die ik heb gelezen waren erg positief zelf zijn we er ook erg tevreden over het resultaat
5012550 de cd is wat minder rauw dan onze demo ook staan er wat meer langere nummers op
5012551 vorig jaar was de eerste editie van de local edition van stichting pan op de affaire daar zijn we toen voor gevraagd met in het achterhoofd het idee dat bands die daar zouden staan eventueel de jaren er op kunnen doorgroeien naar het avondprogramma dat is ook gebeurd dit jaar spelen er op de affaire sowieso een stuk meer locale bands
5012552 vorig jaar speelden we op de zondagmiddag en toen hebben we het goed naar ons zin gehad dus we gaan er van uit dat het dit jaar ook wel weer leuk zal worden

5012567 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
5012568 by design those attacks put the american population into a state of intense fear of islamic terrorism far more than the 9 11 attacks alone could have accomplished
5012569 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
5012570 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
5012571 this is not intended to be a mere discussion of violations of law that have occurred
5012572 it is rather intended to be a planning conference at which plans will be laid and necessary organizational structures set up
5012573 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime

5012575 our friend kate is beginning to recover in nairobi after a dramatic airlift from uganda shes not home yet but shes getting better
5012576 keonis been real steady for us hes one of the most experienced of the bunch as far as playing in games and being in the system for five years
5012577 today was a good reminder that we lost everybody quarterback receivers and were still searching we didnt make the plays we needed to that was a little bit about inexperience we need to work on that
5012578 coach lee knows what hes talking about were going to watch a lot of film hes going to look at this probably a million times and help us try to correct every mistake help us have a better offensive day
5012579 as i look at it the days go by so fast the next thing you know its going to be the end of the season already i try to enjoy every day as much as i can get as many reps as i can and try to help our younger guys i cant miss any practices this is my last chance to play if you think about it we play florida two saturdays from now its going to go by extremely fast
5012580 over time steinhoff developed from a promising walk on following his graduation from damien into a 6 foot 3 280 pound starter who enters 2008 among the most seasoned of the linemen he stepped into the position vacated by dane uperesa after the 2006 campaign and started all 13 games at right tackle last season
5012581 he was a walk on and undersized but we saw a lot of potentia hes just a kid whos always bought into the fundamentals of the program he paid attention to the linemen who played before him and took coaching from them as well as the coaches
5012582 hes shown me a lot of mistakes ive made in the past and i try to do my best to improve on it i think i just have to work on my hands my punch getting guys off of me
5012583 its still in my mind every day somebody mentions it it puts a chip on my shoulder and keeps me driving every day makes me work harder and prepare for our bigger opponents it does help me but its in the past
5012584 our defense is giving us a good fast look every day and were playing at a fast tempo trying to make it as stressful for them as possible
5012585 once footballs over im going to be at every one of this games im one of his biggest fans

5012591 most of haiti is under heavy rains especially in the south with winds clocked at about 70 kilometers per hour 43 mph
5012592 there will be no problem about a new contract for gary
5012593 he will be up for a new deal you can be sure about that because hes a remarkable person
5012594 the way he has come back after 18 months is remarkable and to then play to the level he played against portsmouth last sunday was perfect
5012595 most of the chinese competitors fully displayed their abilities to realize the goal of achieving good results on home soil
5012596 we are especially pleased by our athletes in judo shooting and weightlifting but every single medal is meaningful in its own way and won through painstaking efforts by our athletes
5012597 generally speaking chinese athletes are not strong contenders in many events in the second half of the games
5012598 with events like track and field starting chinas pace in winning gold medals will slow down
5012599 i just want to enjoy this moment because im having an unbelievable year
5012600 its more than my best dreams so i want to enjoy the moment i know how difficult it is to win these things especially here winning for me is unbelievable

5012604 the olympics means really a lot to me so thats why im really happy im little bit sad about the match but all things considered im really happy
5012605 the whole thing every race one after the other from winning by one hundredth of a second to finishing if off with a world record its an amazing experience

5012607 grieving is healthy theres no secret trick to coping with loss no checklist to complete everyone deals with death differently but the most important early step is to banish feelings of helplessness its ok to grieve and important to do so its good to stay busy but not too busy keeping painful memories emotions or thoughts hidden in the long run only prolongs grief seeking help is crucial friends and family or your church may offer comfort and support but a third party like a professional counselor or religious guide will bring a fresh perspective to your situation and provide a good ear for your feelings and concerns dont beat yourself up for needing help and asking for it doing so is healthy coping with loss is a process as you work through your grief you may find that youre able to regain your balance and reengage in life in a deeper way
5012608 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5012609 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5012610 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5012611 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5012612 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5012613 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5012614 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5012617 no we do not live in a communist country but we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and stability of both fiscal and monetary policy
5012618 when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households and ultimately on businesses and it does put a bit of a handbrake on the economy
5012619 so i think the public have got a right to expect when official rates come down that rates set by the banks come down as well
5012620 its all pretty simple when the official cash rate goes down then borrowing costs should follow
5012621 if those costs were to come down on a sustained basis then there would be no justification for the banks maintaining that margin that they put in there when costs were up
5012622 many estimates are that theres possibly another half trillion dollars of that to come to account so i think while thats hanging over the markets we are not going to see a significant level of confidence build up in markets until we get through probably a couple of quarters of non surprises
5012623 whats interesting is that about 40 per cent of exporters also import so you might be hammered on the price side from a high dollar but you might get some benefit from lower costs of the imported goods and services your business uses
5012624 so its swings and roundabouts some could get windfall gains from an easing dollar
5012625 overall it should be a fabulous result and their cash flow should be something to behold
5012626 it would be nice if shareholders and would be shareholders could see a little bit more of it through an acceleration of bhps progressive dividend policy
5012627 im the guy who raised the idea in august 2005 but if it doesnt happen our business plan isnt contingent on it
5012628 we are interested in doing it under the right circumstances
5012629 we have to earn a competitive return it has to be done in the right sequence and with the right technology

5012642 uh its you know its high its middle of the road but you can tell i mean its not totally if you know the signs and you know it if you go into it knowing then you can start to see the signs
5012643 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
5012644 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective

5012682 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5012683 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5012684 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5012685 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5012686 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5012687 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5012688 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5012689 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5012690 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5012691 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5012692 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5012693 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5012694 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5012695 woods study must be vast with well stocked shelves judging by the inarguable erudition displayed in his compact vade mecum of short chapters and neatly numbered sections devoted to such topics as point of view characterization fictional detail and toward the end nothing less than a brief history of consciousness he drops his quotations and references as copiously easily and freely as a man on a bench in central park scattering cups of birdseed
5012696 expand or alter perception by exalting the vernacular absorbing the anarchic and ennobling the vulgar
5012697 we believe in the separation of church and state but we do not believe in the separation of faith and politics because faith is just a worldview and everybody has some kind of worldview and its important to know what they are
5012698 i think the opposition to the war in iraq was as tough a decision as ive had to make not only because there were political consequences but also because saddam hussein was a real bad person and there was no doubt that he meant america ill but i was firmly convinced at the time that we did not have strong evidence of weapons of mass destruction
5012699 i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis
5012700 whether youre looking at it from a theoretical or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5012701 if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent in that belief then i cant argue with you because that is a core issue of faith for you what i can do is say are there ways that we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5012702 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them
5012703 ganamos porque tuvimos oficio fuimos inteligentes a la hora de ver el partido ellos quiz tuvieron mejor trato de pelota pero nosotros dispusimos de las situaciones m s claras de contragolpe inclusive sobre el final tuvimos dos que si hubieran entrado nos habr an ahorrado sufrimiento
5012704 hay tambi n un sistema para defenderse cuando el rival te domina el f tbol no es s lo jugar la pelotita hacer pases y meter goles tambi n hay momentos en los que te ten s que defender y belgrano defensivamente estuvo muy s lido adem s tuvo contragolpes como para definir el partido
5012705 belgrano no gan por olave gan porque hizo un trabajo sucio debi pelear el partido porque tal vez no est bamos muy finos le qued lucharlo pelearlo
5012706 una sobre el primer palo que saqu con las piernas porque hab a hecho un paso para cortar el centro
5012707 en el primer tiempo dentro de lo que buscamos futbol sticamente el equipo por momentos funcion bien hizo un gol y podr a haber aumentado en el segundo se nos vino instituto encima pero pudimos cerrar bien el partido en resumen me quedo con el funcionamiento del primer tiempo y el orden t ctico y la actitud del segundo
5012708 georgi zal als het wil en dat wil het lid van de navo worden
5012709 er was niet veel nieuws maar de familie wil het eerst zelf verwerken dat is natuurlijk begrijpelijk
5012710 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
5012711 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
5012712 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear
5012713 i dont want to live just to survive i want to love my life
5012714 fred loved his family he loved his son and he loved his fiancee
5012715 we have a number of witnesses and a number of persons assisting us with our inquiries
5012716 by releasing this reward we aim to encourage in particular a specific caller who rang crime stoppers in 1994 and provided specific and detailed information regarding the identity of freds killer how he was killed and the location of where fred was killed
5012717 i urge that caller to call back knowing what we do now this has increased the significance of this callers information from 1994
5012718 in all of these matters there is always somebody that has not told the whole story of what they know
5012719 this caller could hold the key to finally solving this case and providing an answer for the family
5012720 we just need to keep working on that and realize that weve won a preseason game its good in some ways but in others it doesnt mean anything
5012721 i think chad henne did a great job he called a nice game and gave us a chance out there i though the offensive line really helped him a bunch today too
5012722 it could well be it does slow down the loading and unloading of trams
5012723 it is not anticipated that the requirement to scan off will slow down trams
5012724 the scanning process is much faster than the current validation process
5012725 as customers leave a tram they will be required to pass their card across the reader at walking pace
5012726 she makes a career out of learning new things and refining her practice
5012727 all children have a skill in something you just have to find what it is and nurture that skill
5012728 some children at our school might be migrants to australia or from a migrant family or from a lower socio economic area but that doesnt mean they cant achieve
5012729 we would as part of our ongoing crackdown on hoon driving consider this
5012730 anything that protects the community from the scourge of hoon drivers the liberal party would support
5012731 the evidentiary value of it may be negligible unless its integrity can be assured
5012732 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5012733 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5012734 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5012735 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5012736 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5012737 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5012738 i only do it to save some money and for the environment of course but everythings so tight with petrol prices and the mortgage
5012739 ive just got to remember to get them out of the back of the car and put them on the front seat
5012740 itll probably depend on how much of a rush im in but ill probably end up paying the 10c
5012741 supermarkets have already factored plastic shopping bags into the price of products we buy so we shouldnt have to pay for something twice
5012742 while plastic bags are very convenient shoppers love them and take home a billion of them a year in victoria they have a long term environmental downside
5012743 i cant wait to be married i feel like it is long overdue and i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous like we all dont have the same rights
5012744 er was niet veel nieuws maar de familie wil het eerst zelf verwerken dat is natuurlijk begrijpelijk
5012745 the government must be up front with residents and tell us if they have an intention to build this road or not
5012746 and as the idea has been raised in several submissions to the eddington report it has been included in our consultations
5012747 we have a love your neighbour attitude its all about human love
5012748 a lot of people say i must do that one day but i realised 10 years ago that one day never comes
5012749 youve got to set that date and work towards it
5012750 for me the anniversary date of my transplant is the symbol it reminds me of the chance i have
5012751 its a thank you to my donor and its proving to myself the world and my donor family that im utilising everything ive got
5012752 where is premier john brumby going to get the extra money and where will the speed cameras go to make up the difference
5012753 but its being riddled with speed cameras from one end to the other
5012754 this is principally due to an expected increase in traffic camera and on the spot fines arising from the planned opening of eastlink
5012755 it was cold and muddy and mucky and the animals crowded all around me for treats their faces inches away the same height as me the game was over
5012756 alpacas are not only cute but intelligent calm and gentle and you can hang out with them they have this hum that settles you
5012757 i saw beautiful mountains a grocery store and even a movie theater i was in heaven
5012758 the implementation of a share premium cancellation would allow our capital structure to more accurately reflect the substantial leverage we are realizing from the gaming intermediary business model we initiated in mid december 2007 we remain confident in our ability to deliver promising results and translate our market leading vip play into shareholder value through the inherent strength in our business model creating a surplus account of over hk 2 2 billion would provide amax with the flexibility to declare a dividend from the companys future profits which the company would consider among other uses of available capital our recent name change to amax entertainment holdings limited reflects our sole focus on the gaming and entertainment business in macau

5012761 when an electrical field is applied to a metal a potential drop associated with that field must take place outside the metal usually at the metal contacts any change in potential inside the metal is prevented by the mobility and number density of the carriers this can be understood from poisson equation

5012764 interference on the part of the ecuadorian state has been undeniable
5012765 judges fear ruling in any way that could be seen as going against correa
5012766 they know they can lose their position and that they can be called traitor to the country
5012767 the report ecuador strengthening of the judiciary reveals a nation and people whose opportunities for development and the protection of human rights is held back by political interference in the judiciary and the misuse of power the recent forced departure of president gutierrez is the latest in a catalogue of former ecuadorian heads of state in exile their exit often clouded by allegations of corruption and misuse of power clearly demonstrates the volatile political crisis the country is in we urge those currently in power not to make the same mistakes as past administrations says ambassador emilio c rdenas human rights institute co chair ecuador needs to be taken on a new road and the independence of the judiciary is the key issue to be addressed in order to find the political stability and economic development the country and its citizens deserve there must be an end to all interference by the executive in judicial matters support for major reforms to the justice system and a steadfast commitment by all those involved to protect the rule of law the countrys new leaders will be judged by whether they can rise to this challenge although the constitution provides for the separation of powers between government and judiciary

5012774 sanctions against apartheid had brought south africa to the point where the transition to democracy had been enshrined in the law of the country
5012775 without the help of international pressure in particular the divestment movement of the 1980s
5012776 similar moral and financial pressures on israel are being mustered one person at a time if apartheid ended so can this occupation but the moral force and international pressure will have to be just as determined the current divestment effort is the first though certainly not the only necessary move in that direction
5012777 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities
5012778 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use
5012779 up to 2 4 percent of the u s population self identifies as mixed race and most of these individuals describe themselves as biracial
5012780 we cannot underestimate the importance of understanding the social psychological and experiential differences that may increase the likelihood of psychological disorders among this fast growing segment of the population
5012781 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
5012782 how disruption brought order the story of a winning strategy in the world of advertising
5012783 the fragmentation of mass media creates a different sort of cycle an inexorable death spiral in which audience fragmentation and ad avoidance hardware lead to an exodus of advertisers
5012784 this must be a mountain i think ive always wanted to climb a mountain

5012791 we have 1 600 members and counting his friend mayank sen says
5012792 whats the most gut wrenching decision youve ever had to make
5012793 as tough a decision that ive had to make not only because there were political consequences but also because saddam hussein was a bad person and there was no doubt he meant america ill
5012794 we had a code of conduct that said you only leave by order of capture
5012795 in the spirit of full disclosure im very happy i didnt know the war was going to last for another three years or so
5012796 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5012797 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5012798 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5012799 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5012800 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5012801 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5012802 the rick warren show is being positioned as a forum aimed at evangelicals the media and the obama campaign should be so lucky check the ratings millions of american jews pagans lapsed catholics buddhists atheists presbyterians hindus muslims shintos and none of the aboves were tuned in too because it was as close as weve come to a side by side demo so far
5012803 when the day will come that the palestinian nations ship will be harbored at the beach of freedom mahmoud darwish will be there
5012804 at any moment those who conquered you and those who conquered your nation could launch a errant shell burn an entire camp and starve your nation but they cant face the power of your language and your words
5012805 we will all miss him he brought the palestinian message to the whole world
5012806 darwish shortened the distance between exile and the homeland the symbol of freedom that was always a few steps above his enemies was buried in ramallah which is a city of symbols arafat and darwish
5012807 darwish will be buried in an impressive burial ceremony in the cultural center in ramallah and a gravesite will be erected on a hill facing the city
5012808 the country will achieve about 35 40 bn dollar in the current fiscal the first quarter has crossed 10 bn dollar last year it was 24 bn dollar for the entire fiscal
5012809 this was an unprovoked attack which has left a man badly injured in hospital
5012810 there may have been witnesses present and i would appeal to them to come forward
5012811 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
5012812 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees
5012813 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5012814 create an environment of trust and prevent any disruptive actions by the enemy
5012815 unless they bring some comprehensive changes in the security this deployment will not affect peoples confidence
5012816 people are afraid to leave their house after 7 p m
5012817 i am still a student but this was an order from the commander of the academy that we should come out and search the vehicles that is why i am here now
5012818 who is behind these phone calls who benefits by upsetting the families of those on board the free gaza and the liberty who would wish to unsettle journalists aboard as unarmed ships set sail towards the waters around gaza and almost certain interception by israeli forces the answer is clear i will carry on bringing you reports from the waters around greece cyprus and even gaza
5012819 the pa has no use if we fail to reach a peace agreement by the end of this year i believe it would be best to go back to the period when we were living happily under israeli occupation
5012820 unless a breakthrough happens by the end of this year in my opinion we should start trying to strive for equality
5012821 god is a hypothesis for which i have no need
5012822 the trials should be marked better than this there should be a sign
5012823 look at what god is doing in and for the world in and through me
5012824 lacked their own research data to back up the assumption thirty nine percent of the articles werent based on any data and even the more rigorous studies often used questionable measures of intelligence
5012825 i would have said she was a low functioning autistic with significant cognitive impairment and i would have been totally wrong
5012826 theres an immediate need to bring all parties to a common consensus to take the country forward
5012827 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal
5012828 under prachandas leadership the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
5012829 prachanda said the new government will be forming economic policies based on suggestions by business people and industrialists
5012830 he also said there would be no curtailing of profits and that the party is eager to work with the private sector
5012831 weve lots of challenges ahead of us but we also have a whole new spirit to confront them
5012832 all the government offices and services were on alert during the ceremony
5012833 the pilgrims were aware that these measures were for their safety and to protect them from terrorist attacks
5012834 there was collaboration between baghdad police and neighbouring provinces of karbala there were special forces from the ministry of interior who also took part
5012835 this was the most successful ceremony since the fall of the saddam hussein regime because we did not face any problems as we marched for seven days to reach karbala
5012836 i had no fear this year the pilgrimage was successful
5012837 i am certain that such a scenario is not possible in ukraine
5012838 prosperity peace and calm in crimea is the very foundation on which the interests of ukraine and neighboring russia coincide everything else is of secondary importance
5012839 if we complete this stage and go on to the next one we can be confident that there will be no russian or any other destabilization scenario in crimea
5012840 i have therefore sent an urgent proposal to the president of russia to start talks on signing an agreement that would regulate our relations in the event of military action like that which we saw at the beginning of august
5012841 in other words we need to come up with clearer rules that would ensure ukraines national security in such situations
5012842 brightening up this decidedly gloomy summer is illustrator james jarvis new installation at niketown in london a giant bird features in his window display for the oxford street store while inside the foyer theres also an eight panel vinyl artwork with the same avian character donning his nike windrunner jacket beanie brownjohn at make stuff sculpted the figure in the window display and free posters relating to the designs may still be available from the store youll have to run like the wind to get one mind
5012843 they werent expected to be found down in that part of the building
5012844 wir werden wohl mehr pleiten von kleinen us regionalbanken sehen die sich auf das hypothekengesch ft konzentriert haben
5012845 aber sie befinden sich noch in einer fr hen entwicklungsphase sie haben die gr e besitzen die notwendige marktkapitalisierung ben tigen aber noch f higkeiten um ausgefeilte bankgesch fte auf h chstem niveau anzubieten
5012846 ich rechne in der branche in der regel eher mit renditen von 15 bis 20 prozent
5012847 we want freedom indians go home and kashmir is ours
5012848 das ist eine bittere niederlage f r unsere nationalmannschaft wir sind nicht mehr die beste ruder nation der welt
5012849 beim drv ist der wurm drin von zuf llen oder fehlendem gl ck kann man nicht sprechen
5012850 wir hatten uns gold vorgenommen wenn es dann bronze ist ist erst einmal eine entt uschung da aber mit ein bisschen abstand kommt freude dazu
5012851 auf den letzten metern ging es nur noch darum den hintern zusammenzukneifen und die z hne zusammenzubei en ich habe das ziel nicht gesehen und die ziel hupe nicht geh rt
5012852 im hoping that were going to hit a crossover audience that this isnt just going to be of interest to methodists
5012853 it has all the elements that youd want to put into a movie
5012854 weve really had to focus on the core spiritual journey of wesley
5012855 some of the stuff that would be very sectarian also of course is not going to appeal to a modern audience and probably wouldnt even appeal to modern methodists
5012856 i think the end result is something that is so far reaching in so many ways that if youre not christian youre not going to be turned off by it and if you are christian youre going to get something very profound from it
5012857 his attitude toward religion when he was young was very external and had to do with doing good works to earn your own way into heaven
5012858 and it really didnt have anything to do with compassion or love or grace at all
5012859 once i had a good idea of who john wesley was and what it was that motivated him i started living as best i knew how as john
5012860 it was probably the most profound experience ive had as an actor in embodying another character not just johns accent or his gait or his posture but his ideology
5012861 academic in mind a bit na ve in heart a bit lost in soul ultimately earnest but at the core of all of that was a desire for gods will a desire for greatness for god and to glorify god in everything he did i do believe that thats at the core of john however humanly fallible that to me is what makes him so identifiable for all of us
5012862 the pulling together of spiritual life and social action and social ministry to the poor is something that i see as very timely right now as we get into a society where the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer
5012863 democrats should take a deep breath and realize that there are a group of voters who wont make up their mind about a candidate until deep in the fall and there are 18 states that are battlegrounds for a reason and theyll be decided by 2 to 4 points i dont care about national polls
5012864 felicitari ati devenit castigatorul premiului oferit de media galaxy constand intr un tv cu plasma samsung 1000
5012865 hey are you gonna do anything with that project because i put a lot of love into that and i would really love to do something with it
5012866 chris you have so many unread messages think of all those people who have taken the time to email you
5012867 vos sos el dios de los pobres you are the god of the poor
5012868 it went well we had a lot of guys get a bunch of plays and a lot of our older guys got some good work like at receiver with a lot of our second team guys like ryan broyles brandon caleb and pooh tennell with the ones
5012869 i would still like to see our second team linemen get a greater understanding of the plays and be a little more sound the same goes for landry jones at quarterback just learning the plays other than that we had some pretty good stuff we had a couple turnovers but we did a lot of good things we did well working on situations we did four minute killing the clock two minute drives goal line and then being backed up on our own one yard line coming out we got a lot of good football situations in today
5012870 i cant remember if it was on a double move or just a takeoff and that all started with our ones where we did protect good
5012871 it has its spots and it is still a double edge sword deal to me
5012872 again where we are practicing coaching our defense and working with a lot of young players
5012873 yeah and you can do it in a game like that but right now we are just giving a way to practice formats and giving a way to coaching in practice
5012874 i think as we get into the weeks to come with our scout team we might do it more right now we are kind of picking our spots because we are trying to not just develop the offense but to develop the defense and develop the team that is where coach brent venables coach stoops and i are trying to do what is the best interest of both sides i dont know if we are doing enough to be as good as i want to be we will maybe see how it plays out put it in gear pull it back and then pull it back out
5012875 well i think we will just get into the games and see how it goes one of the reasons why we are doing this in practice is just for emphasis or coaching not that we thought about not using it however there are different styles where you can say this series you are going to be that way or the next series you are going to huddle up we had situations today again where we were working on two minute and four minute situations and working on how to use the clock and maximize the use of your minutes
5012876 i thought jameel owens and dejuan miller for the young guys made a couple of nice plays
5012877 ryan broyles pooh tennell and brandon caleb got a chance to play with sam and the ones today juaquin iglesias and those old guys got a set or two and then they were out and then the second team players got to play with the good protection and our starting quarterback with that being said our young kids did make some plays i could sense in our first year guys that i think in time maybe those kids will have a chance to help us out this year
5012878 i didnt give him some running situations today with the backs but we will
5012879 we are trying to get that worked into the offense that is the one part of the package of things that we wanted to look at today and was the one thing that i didnt get to look at that is something that well work on this week in practice but he has done it before but in this scrimmage i wish we in hindsight would have got him a couple of carries before it was over
5012880 yeah but as much as anything we saw in the spring that he could be our one back
5012881 however we have toyed around if our tight ends could play well enough on short yardage we could have a big set with brody eldridge as a fullback and him as a tailback i havent done that yet because i need brody at tight end right now

5012883 i hate the song it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
5012884 katy is our daughter and we love her but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself at the moment we cannot cut her out of our lives as she is our child but she knows we disagree strongly with what she is doing and the message she is promoting regarding homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin
5012885 the first half today was as good as we can play
5012886 we went into the match with a real determination to do well we didnt win anything last season and wanted to show what we are all about now

5012922 now there is a free program in spanish to help negotiate reasonable balances and payment plans the anxiety so many victims of hospital price gouging face is being replaced with real concern real help real discounts and real solutions for these patients

5012929 for example get your vaccines medications and screening tests all at the same visit
5012930 when i talked to mr squadron following a coda meeting he was opposed to congestion pricing im in favor of congestion pricing
5012931 on congestion pricing squadron though unsure of how he would have voted said the bill should have been altered and passed
5012932 declined to say if he would have voted for the bill as it was presented to lawmakers
5012933 congestion pricing i supported it i didnt tell anybody i didnt take a position on it i supported it
5012934 i interpreted the same line of connors as i didnt tell anybody i didnt take a position on it
5012935 i supported it and the timing of his pauses especially when placed in the context of squadron recently reported non position and similar squadron equivocations on the gansevoort waste transfer station and who he supported for president in april in response to the question he said
5012936 hes not a giant i think hes about 6ft 3in 6ft 4in but what he did have was tremendous physical strength which you obviously need for the sport
5012937 but he also had tremendous stamina he was a very good cross country runner as a youngster and then when he got a bit older he started weight training
5012938 canada were always going to be a tough act to bear but our guys got the silver and i think theres been many years in the olympics when medals have been less frequently won
5012939 were doing pretty well and good for wales as well obviously two toms have got medals in the olympics for wales
5012940 weve already had two people come down to the club this weekend
5012941 admittedly i think at least one of them has rowed before but nevertheless it has put rowing in the spotlight once again as it does in every olympics
5012942 i just want to enjoy this moment because im having an unbelievable year
5012943 its more than my best dreams so i want to enjoy the moment i know how difficult it is to win these things winning here for me is unbelievable
5012944 im little bit sad about the match but all things considered im really happy
5012945 palacios was superb the kid has got everything you want in a footballer and if he keeps playing like this hell be a fantastic one
5012946 it was arsene wenger who recommended him i was trying to sign mathieu flamini for birmingham at the time and couldnt get him but wenger said ive got this lad from honduras on trial and hes worth a look
5012947 he came to birmingham did well and i signed him again for wigan in january
5012948 hes been great and it would take a lot of money to prise him off us now luckily there are only two weeks to go to the transfer deadline
5012949 he was just like the player i saw when i went over to egypt hustling and bustling around
5012950 i wondered whether he could reproduce that in the premier league and it looks like he can
5012951 if he keeps his feet on the ground and adds a little bit of composure to his game then hell do really well for us
5012952 but were frustrated today because of those first 15 minutes when we were dreadful

5012955 obviously it was bad enough to come off yesterday and with injuries like that it usually takes about 48 hours for them to settle or get worse
5012956 hes got a big flight we have to manage it to ensure he gets plenty of ice on it on the way home
5012957 if we keep the swelling down then he shouldnt be out for too long
5012958 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them
5012959 i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try

5012969 its better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal
5012970 this week has also been rather difficult for me emotionally i had to let go of a long term relationship a friendship which at one time brought much joy and happiness into my life but sadly has turned sour over the past several months people can be like plants in odd ways and if a relationship is not watered or nurtured it too can suffer from thirst its leaves can turn from a bright green to a muted brown and like the colorless leaves on the once healthy plant it too will eventually die sometimes we must let go of people places and things even though we still care about them so much or harbor good memories or at worse we are so much in love with them if it turns out that they will provide an unhealthy or toxic element inside of our own lives staying free of such compulsions is not easy and often the pain of walking away can be very sharp and pierce a deep wound open inside of ones own heart letting go involves surrendering for our own good and ultimate peace of mind often we must let go as well to honor and respect the needs of the other person even if their goals are quite different from our own today in the middle of all the business involved in my life i too am trying to walk through the pain of letting go of a friendship that was not healthy for me i see him everyday and i try to act and live normally around him this does not mean that i do not feel sad nor i dont have any feelings anymore for this person i still love and i truly miss this person but sometimes we have to let go to grow even with the pain and hurt so we can get to the other side of the rainbow with the hope that there is still light inside ofcourse i do hope that someday our paths will cross again and when that time comes well see if were really meant to be i still believe in us thank you for your minds

5012973 ive loved you for so long and i never told you and now at the end we finally confess to each other through this deeply heartfelt kiss
5012974 if you live by the sword you will die by the sword
5012975 whats the most gut wrenching decision youve ever had to make
5012976 as tough a decision that ive had to make not only because there were political consequences but also because saddam hussein was a bad person and there was no doubt he meant america ill
5012977 we had a code of conduct that said you only leave by order of capture
5012978 in the spirit of full disclosure im very happy i didnt know the war was going to last for another three years or so
5012979 went against party loyalty and maybe even against your own best interest for the good of america
5012980 well ill give you an example that in fact i worked with john mccain on
5012981 and that was the issue of campaign ethics reform and finance reform
5012982 my knowledge and my background told me that a few hundred marines in a situation like that could not successfully carry out any kind of peacekeeping mission and i thought they were going into harms way
5012983 what would be the greatest moral failure in your life and what would be the greatest moral failure of america
5012984 the failure of my first marriage its my greatest moral failure
5012985 he could have avoided that altogether or come up with some other answer
5012986 but he very quickly cleanly and clearly confessed his failure
5012987 the clarity of confessing his failure there will be respect in the evangelical community for doing so
5012988 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5012989 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5012990 but let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with one thing that im absolutely convinced of is there is a moral and ethical content to this issue so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue i think is not paying attention so that would be point number one
5012991 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5012992 okay we dont have to go longer on that one
5012993 abortion and marriage are still pivotal issues but i think that abortion is probably more pivotal than marriage
5012994 abortion is still very very solid with this group even the younger ones who are more liberal on marriage life is a real delineating factor
5012995 i thought sen obamas statement in quoting matthew 25 which is my favorite scripture since i was in high school whatever you do to the least of my brethren you do likewise to me when as a matter of record he voted against partial birth abortion well i find it discouraging and disingenuous for him to talk about the least of our brethren
5012996 given the magnitude complexity and number of out of state witnesses in this case this was the only logical venue for the next step in the process
5012997 i think its going to be pretty evident that the officer was fearful of his safety and life and thats why he had to fire
5012998 israels defense industries have sold remote piloted vehicles rpvs one of which was shot down by russian fighters in may automatic turrets for armored vehicles antiaircraft systems communication systems shells and rocket to georgias
5012999 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
5013000 to every israeli agent representing an israeli defense company is attached a cousin of the defense minister who opens the doors for him
5013001 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
5013002 we are now in a fight against the great russia
5013003 georgian government officials used to tell me that they wanted to model their army after the israeli army
5013004 in my opinion these developments are due in part to advice georgia received from israeli companies that operate there
5013005 commissioned from private israeli security firms several hundred military advisers estimated at up to 1 000 to train the georgian armed forces in commando air sea armored and artillery combat tactics they also offer instruction on military intelligence and security for the regime tbilisi also purchased weapons intelligence and electronic warfare systems from israel
5013006 these advisers were undoubtedly deeply involved in the georgian armys preparations to conquer the south ossetian capital
5013007 there has been no decision by israel to stop selling weapons the gossip about that in the israeli media is linked to the internal political process in israel
5013008 there is an obvious israeli involvement in the present conflict between georgia and russia

5013012 today i concentrated only on my moves not the medals
5013013 i felt that i had a very normal performance without surprises and that is why i got a silver medal
5013014 im disappointed especially since third place had a fall and i made both of mine
5013015 i cant change her score the judges made up their minds
5013016 i definitely had to pull myself together a little bit the last few days

5013039 take time to be holy speak oft with your lord
5013040 the toughest part about being a pastor is there is no one to preach to you when you need it
5013041 therefore do not be foolish but understand what the will of the lord is
5013042 this is good and it is pleasing in the sight of god our savior who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth
5013043 and do not get drunk with wine for that is debauchery but be filled with the spirit
5013044 for this is the will of god your sanctification that you abstain from sexual immorality that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor not in the passion of lust like the gentiles who do not know god that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter because the lord is an avenger in all these things as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you
5013045 be subject for the lords sake to every human institution whether it be to the emperor as supreme or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good for this is the will of god that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people
5013046 and after you have suffered a little while the god of all grace who has called you to his eternal glory in christ will himself restore confirm strengthen and mestablish you
5013047 for it is better to suffer for doing good if that should be gods will than for doing evil

5013057 i just live there for now how the hell did you know
5013058 go home with one of these girls go to the village where they live meet their parents eat dog with them drink lao lao lao alcohol with them spend all night slapping malaria ridden mosquitos see the expression on her little brothers face when she arrives from the city bearing food for them and you will understand why they come out to the street and beg for an older man
5013059 they have no choice they can work maybe selling coconuts for thirty cents an hour but you wouldnt do that i wouldnt do that nobody would do that all of us would rather love someone for one night and live off of that for a month
5013060 but who are these men who come here just to buy prositutes that is disgusting if you are sixty years old do not sleep with your grand daughter
5013061 im not attracted to a sixty year old women now
5013062 i doubt i will be when im sixty my taste in women hasnt changed since i was twelve
5013063 cant get women in their own country they spend their lives making money devoting themselves to a family a job whatever do you know how much effort it takes for some people to sleep with a terribly beautiful woman havent you ever read a novel before think how much easier it would be to buy a plane ticket and sleep with a different beautiful girl every single night and the money that they spend means nothing to them only people like p diddy can do that without paying for it and look how much he spends on women anyway how many novels how many love stories appear idiotic to men like that
5013064 sexpats are the easiest people in the world to understand
5013065 this girl is so young shes mentally retarded so these disgusting assholes they take her and they make her love them she doesnt know any better i see her on the streets crouching down smiling she doesnt know any better so every night we buy her beers we give her cigarettes and she fucking chainsmokes man and she drinks everything we give her but never acts any different now this girl we love this girl man we protect this girl if we dont drink with her you know what happens she gets bored she goes on the street and goes to that fucking bar down the road that you came from

5013074 about nine years he can speak chinese fluently and he worked in some aid projects too
5013075 maybe he was right maybe that was what you were thinking
5013076 everywhere i go people scream at me hey ladyboy whats youre name all because i walk around in a dress
5013077 buddhism is great here its not really a religion is it more like a philosophy or a way of life
5013078 how is it not like a religion it has an afterlife it has dieties it has graven images and sacred texts it has rituals beliefs and faith its adopted by the state so that people are forced to serve as mandatory buddhist monks when theyre growing up its worse than religion its medieval
5013079 then why is it everyone i meet in the west says its not a religion
5013080 exactly so its not really a religion then is it

5013088 demand has accelerated and rising immigration both permanent and temporary shows no sign of abating meanwhile rising interest rates continue to stymie any building recovery
5013089 underlying housing demand is already outstripping new supply and the gap is set to widen sharply driving pent up housing demand to record levels
5013090 with population growing at the fastest rate in 18 years we simply should be building more homes not less
5013091 interest rate hikes have spooked investors and budding owner occupiers
5013092 investors are putting their money in the bank and people are staying in the rental market longer but the situation is unsustainable
5013093 the latest slump in new dwelling approvals is clearly bad news for those renting
5013094 the supply of apartments isnt rising but the number of people wanting to rent certainly is
5013095 its better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal

5013105 during her lunch hour jane edwards a doctor in sheffield england stopped at the post office to renew her daughters passport since the family was planning a trip to france

5013107 the results of the study indicated that lowering posted speed limits by as much as 20 mi h 32 km h or raising speed limits by as much as 15 mi h 24 km h had little effect on motorist speed the majority of motorist did not drive 5 mi h 8 km h above the posted speed limits when speed limits were raised nor did they reduce their speed by 5 or 10 mi h 8 or 16 km h when speed limits are lowered data collected at the study sites indicated that the majority of speed limits are posed below the average speed of traffic lowering speed limits below the 50th percentile does not reduce accidents but does significantly increase driver violations of the speed limit conversely raising the posted speed limits did not increase speeds or accidents arbitrary unrealistic and nonuniform speed limits have created a socially acceptable disregard for speed limits unrealistic limits increase accident risks for persons who attempt to comply with limit by driving slower or faster than the majority of road users unreasonably low limits significantly decrease driver compliance and give road users such as person not familiar with the road and pedestrians a false indication of actual traffic speeds for years traffic engineering texts have supported the conclusion that motorists ignore unreasonable speed limits
5013108 where speed limits were lowered the 1st percentile slowest drivers actually increased their speed and the overall accident rate increased meanwhile higher speed limits provoked 99th percentile fastest drivers to reduce their speed slightly and accident rates decreased overall how does this relate to the war on drugs perhaps it is a stretch but one could conceivably extract from this study that more restrictive laws such as lower speed limits spurred even the most cautious individuals to push harder against the laws while more relaxed laws caused the most flagrant lawbreakers to back off more importantly however i submit that this study indicates that people know what is right and safe and most will do what they want regardless of the law people who want to use drugs do so now people who dont want to use drugs wont start shooting up just because its legal those more willing to try a legal drug than an illegal one would be balanced by those who have lost the thrill of rebelling against the system

5013116 self objectification has also been repeatedly shown to sap cognitive functioning because of all the attention devoted to body monitoring for instance a recent study by yale psychologists asked two groups of women to take a math exam one group in swimsuits the other in sweaters the swimsuit wearers distracted by body concerns performed significantly worse than their peers in sweaters
5013117 the medical literature on the subject is not voluminous but i did turn up one study conducted fittingly by ze french brissette et al 1985 from quebec actually
5013118 at 11 00 pm after placement of the electrodes and thermistors subjects retired to their room and the anal probe was inserted the anal probe transmitted pressure changes in the anal canal to a transducer connected to a dc amplifier the use of this anal probe gave an objective account of the orgasm in both men and women

5013123 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5013124 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5013132 warm weather during the early part of november took its toll on online retail sales and played a role in holding down the growth in spending over the entire holiday season
5013133 however if we look at the period between thanksgiving and christmas we see online spending growing at a healthier 21 rate which i think is encouraging given the economic challenges facing consumers this year as a result of higher gas prices lower home values and a jittery stock market

5013188 der start ist mir wirklich gut gelungen ich konnte die pace gut mitgehen in den ersten beiden sektoren war ich gar schneller als simoncelli er gegen ende der runde ich konnte problemlos mithalten
5013189 in der vierten runde war ich zu schnell und mir ist das vorderrad eingeklappt da musste ich die bremse l sen und konnte nur noch geradeaus weiter
5013190 auf dem curb hat es mir das hinterrad weggehauen und ich bin gest rzt es ist wirklich rgerlich denn das rennen ist bis dahin super f r mich gelaufen und ich habe mir hier einiges ausgerechnet nichtsdestotrotz war es wichtig zu sehen dass wir auch nach der sommerpause wieder ganz vorne mithalten k nnen

5013203 a m me espanta que en am rica latina a pesar de los flagrantes ejemplos de populismo y autoritarismo haya sectores que todav a piensan que se socialismo autoritario puede ser el camino
5013204 es una ceguera que hay que combatir de manera clara recordando lo que significa para un pueblo equivocarse en t rminos de corrupci n en violencia en restricci n de las libertades en frustraci n

5013518 the focus and aim of our campaign remains to keep all of our post offices open
5013519 work has started on a strong analysis of the impact that each closure would have on the local community
5013520 throughout the consultation period we will continue to campaign vociferously and i would urge everyone to sign the councils petition to save our post offices
5013521 these are the very people who stand to lose out most if their local post office closes

5013530 this is a serious and dangerous issue as one business owner to another i strongly encourage you to recall all of these blenders before someone dies at the very least you need to discontinue carrying these items
5013531 knew these blades were defective and sold them anyway from august 15 2008 email
5013532 just last week we received a quantity of new blade assemblies from our supplier in asia and i want to be sure that you got the new one
5013533 we had not been happy with the previous blade even though ive not seen the catastrophic failure that you experienced this new blade assembly has performed better than the previous ones in the tests that we have done here
5013534 there is nothing in my email or any fact of this situation that supports any accusation that we knowingly sell defective products
5013535 we respectfully ask that you consider removing from your internet blog the inflammatory attacks you have made against us and our products what you experienced is extremely unusual and is not representative of our overall product quality
5013536 i will say this twice i will say this twice
5013537 i was petrified i started sweating heavily and shaking my mind was racing and i could hear a loud thumping noise like someone banging a big drum i couldnt work it out then i realised it was my heart
5013538 exhausted emotionally vulnerable isolated and far from home i was ready for the taking
5013539 for a moment i was convinced i was dying i knew i was in serious trouble i had to get help
5013540 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave it sucked the breath clean out of my lungs the next 48 hours were hell
5013541 i started thinking seriously about doing myself harm i knew i didnt want to carry on living like this
5013542 it was as though someone flicked a switch i knew it was over the tears welled up as i started to walk back to the pavilion
5013543 i knew i no longer had any say in the matter the illness had come back the thought of what i was doing hit me like a kick in the guts i would probably never again experience the great highs hard work and joy of playing for england

5013546 ayaw na nga ng nanay ko na ipahukay pa pero iba na ang habol namin dito katarungan para sa pagkamatay ng aking kapatid
5013547 naaalarma kami sa tumataas na ulat ng pagpapakamatay ng mga ofw sa uae ang aming tsapter sa dubai ay nakapagtala na ng pitong kaso
5013548 nagulat kami hindi lamang dahil sa biglang pagtaas ng bilang ng mga kaso ng pagpapakamatay kundi dahil sa walang ginagawa ang mga opisyal ng embahada sa mga kasong ito kundi ideklarang itoy mga pagpapakamatay nang hindi man lamang iniimbestigahan
5013549 at kung lumabas sa awtopsiya na may foul play sa pagkamatay dapat lamang magsampa ng kaso ang mga opisyal ng embahada laban sa mga may kagagawan nito
5013550 ang mga misteryosong pagkamatay na ito at iba pang isyu pang migrante ang tatalakayin ng mga migrante sa international assembly of migrants and refugees na gaganapin sa darating na oktubre

5013552 napier is art deco obsessed complete with an employed art deco ambassador
5013553 its good to be seen there thats excellent it will attract extra people especially overseas visitors already in the country theres the potential for the festival to use the reference in its own marketing
5013554 ive been to the festival and i think its stunning what i like about it is that its a complete point of difference and napier does it so well
5013555 the overseas people book well in advance but new zealanders leave it till the last minute
5013556 with four million people and 40 million sheep its only right there should be a shearing festival
5013557 the worlds highest 14 7 megapixel 28mm wide angle lens digital camera
5013558 it was emotional to go through the pics on the camera and delete four out of five good ones in order to keep one that was to be submitted
5013559 some of the rules seem to be limitations of organisational process more than anything else
5013560 dont think that if you have four good photographers with their cameras you have four times as many chances of taking a good shot all the photos have to be not just on the same memory card but taken on the same camera
5013561 to help carry gear and props solve clues come up with ideas and spot good shots and to pose for shots the other three dont actually need to all be good photographers but a good photographic eye will help
5013562 you can sometimes see a shot and think wow thats original and then see four variations on it following
5013563 i was seriously impressed with some of the photos and saw some wonderful shots
5013564 there was one photo with three people with umbrellas jumping on the millennium bridge it was an amazing photo
5013565 but in many cases the winning shot wasnt in my opinion one of the good ones
5013566 judges seemed to favour an obvious joke equivalent of a zany holiday snap over a technically interesting or well composed art shot
5013567 there is no shortage of takers for this fun day out but if youre already a dslr owning multiple lens using flickr account holding arty shot taking passionate amateur camera geek this contest may not be what youre looking for
5013568 this photo looks like film frames with the main frame being taken up by daniela
5013569 i found microstock back in the days when it still was the
5013570 i knew a designer that had many small business owners restaurants owners and auto repair shops as customers
5013571 they had 400 650 to spend this is not much of a budget if they needed five images the licensing fees at a traditional stock houses each image would cost about 50 which totals to 250 usd
5013572 my web designer friend could not make a profit and still pay the licensing fees
5013573 the designer gets to pay a license he can afford the business owner gets a website that looks good i can shoot the images then license them to 10 000 other small business owners who are in the same boat
5013574 now that we are selling to this segment of the market that they have ignored we are bottom feeders and accused of stealing the food from their mouths
5013575 the people who buy rf microstock are not the same as the ones licensing rm
5013576 they are not the same ones that can afford to license rf from traditional stock houses
5013577 these are customers that because of greed arrogance and mistaking business for art photographers told to fuck off
5013578 in general stock incomes have stagnated for most photographers over the past five years with slightly more than half 52 of respondents reporting incomes that have stayed the same or fallen
5013579 more people do photography as a hobby then a profession
5013580 if you make it a profession theres ample opportunity to make a decent living in microstock
5013581 i define a professional microstocker as someone with an average portfolio of 1000 10 000 images and an average download rate of about 30 250 images per day
5013582 i will confine this discussion to gold level exclusive istockphoto contributors since i have the most knowledge about this level
5013583 on average gold members have 1000 images in their portfolios over 10 000 downloads and receive a 35 commission rate the average payment per download would be closer to 1 54 a typical download rate per month would be about 1 100 images
5013584 additional income consists of extended license sells print sales and custom jobs shoots from contacts made on these sites extended license sells and custom jobs shoots on average will add 50 00 to 100 00 to each months total when we add these numbers together 1 54 x 1100 1700 x 12 20 400 you get a better picture of the average professional microstockers income
5013585 corbis licenses a 2 mb file for 140 usd of this i am guessing the photographer get about 20 or 28 usd
5013586 i have no way of knowing what the true commission is but i know getty pays a 20 commission i can find no reason to believe corbis would pay much higher
5013587 i am not trying to convince photographers to switch over to shooting for rf microstock
5013588 each person has their business to run and to make profitable
5013589 we really need really about how the new models of selling photography effect business and how we can capitalize on this new market
5013590 sometimes we treat our images like children and we take things too personally stock photographic has always been about business nothing has chanced in the last five years what is the first rule of business buy for a penny and sale for a dime
5013591 microstock site do not ask you to submit 3 000 images for concretion
5013592 microstock sites have a very fast turn around time for getting these images on the market
5013593 as of april 23 2008 i have 1176 images online the pattern of downloads is 10 of these get multiple downloads each day another percent of the portfolio downloads once a day and some images download only once a month what i am always surprise about is the total amount poor performers contribute to the bottom line
5013594 it question depends on how much money you need to support your standard of living
5013595 you can find some very interesting ideas about this subject here for mepersonally i did not start in microstock to make a living i started submitting images to supplement my photographic income
5013596 with stock photography since you do not know if or how long it will take to get your investment back you must keep the costs low
5013597 i use 5 to 10 of each months earning and reinvest this into image making this may not seem like much but so far this has been working i find you have to get creative to keep the costs this low
5013598 i am a grinder like 90 of the photographers working i am passionate about photography and love my job in my group of photo friends i am the person who can light anything in the end i will let the images speak for themselves
5013599 how long did it take you to build up your microstock portfolio
5013600 hey dont ask a question like that it make it sound like i have stop building it
5013601 i am a slow starter and it took me over six months to get 100 images into the portfolio
5013602 once i saw you could turn this into a profitable business i got serious about producing images remember selling stock images is just part of my photographic income in the beginning i had to find a way to make it fit into my schedule to make this work and to keep cost low my workflow had to be tight
5013603 that i decided to surf the web to find useful information about photography during the search i stumbled across and ended up contacting walter lo cascio an italian architect who has a powerful passion for photography we became friends and he ended up giving me a lot of great advice
5013604 look at those great pictures that are in books and on the web if you want to learn how to take a good picture
5013605 i thought it was impossible to learn how to take a good picture just looking at others works
5013606 walter would be relentless however and started showing me some of his and of others best pictures
5013607 i started surfing through photography forums and reading the comments left for the pictures that fascinated me
5013608 reading the comments has been pretty useful to me because i have been able to learn from others mistakes and also because ive been able to find some interesting information about topics like lens aperture shutter speed and other technical aspects of the shot
5013609 i didnt remember exactly what i did to reach this result
5013610 i just couldnt be satisfied because i kept thinking in physics too an experiment makes sense only if you can repeat it
5013611 i must be able to repeat this kind of shot
5013612 i started thinking about what i had to do and i realized that beyond the shutter speed or the lens aperture it was also important to care about where lights come from and what is behind the subject
5013613 even if they are both taken against the light there were too many details
5013614 i only tried to learn and take inspiration from other works and with a lot of attempts and effort i think to have reached something decent
5013615 issues with its automatic exposure and white balance make it an unsatisfactory option as a first dslr
5013616 professional level camera that puts an emphasis on mobility and ease of use
5013617 the e 410 will appeal to entry level dslr shooters looking for a smaller lighter and more affordable camera body
5013618 the 410 has the supersonic wave filter that literally shakes off dust a nice feature to have
5013619 high marks for photo quality with very low noise images minimal lens distortion excellent metering and exposure and pleasing colors
5013620 the nikon d40 is a superlative budget dslr certain to be a smash
5013621 its 2 5fps shooting speed unlimited jpeg bursts and fast shutter response keep it highly competitive
5013622 the d40 is arguably the most accessible d slr out there
5013623 my d40 is the best camera i know of for people and family photography
5013624 excellent 10 1 megapixel sensor with impressively low noise and superb detail
5013625 owners of the original eos 300d who avoided the 350d xt will find it hard to resist the 400d xti
5013626 the xti may be an entry level camera but its quite the performer
5013627 an excellent first step into the world of dslr cameras
5013628 in our lab tests the sigma sd14s performance was not impressive especially considering its price
5013629 there are several other performance enhancements that will appeal to pros and enthusiasts
5013630 in terms of image noise sharpness and general ease of use it is a little lacking
5013631 designed for the experienced photographer the sd14 has superb image quality and colour fidelity when used in its intended raw format
5013632 the sigma d14 uses foveon x3 which stacks them to eliminate any problems produced by having a lateral shift between color sensors
5013633 as live view modes in slrs go the 510s version is pretty nice but its still clunkier than shooting with a real compact camera
5013634 the e 510 continues the olympus tradition of appealing to novice or developing photographers with simple easy to use high end cameras
5013635 serious photographers who want is for low light shooting plus a large battery and some extra control buttons
5013636 the e 510 is a great entry level d slr unless you must have the small size of the e 410 id spend the extra 100 and get the e 510 the image stabilization and more powerful battery are well worth the price
5013637 with a better grip image stabilization and all the optical benefits of the four thirds system under its belt the olympus e 510 is currently the most well rounded choice among four thirds slr cameras
5013638 its the same thing as the 300 less expensive d40
5013639 the most significant change from the d40x isnt to the camera at all its the move to an optically stabilized version of the kit lens
5013640 a good solid 10 megapixel entry level dslr very easy to use nothing truly groundbreaking
5013641 excepting the minor cosmetic difference to allow for the motion sensor the nikon d60 is a clone of the d40x
5013642 the 10 2 megapixel nikon d60 is an improved version of nikons d40x camera
5013643 essentially identical to the sony a200 the top deck of the sony a300 and a350 have one unique feature the live view ovf optical viewfinder switch this switch engages the live view mode by moving the front element of the pentamirror forward
5013644 other notable features include eye start autofocus which is triggered as soon as the camera is brought near the photographers eye and sonys d range optimizer dro for enhancing shadow and highlight detail in high contrast shots
5013645 just by looking at it youd never guess that sonys new alpha a300 digital camera represents a huge technical breakthrough
5013646 with 10 2 megapixels lightning fast performance high quality images with very low noise and a heaping pile of convenience features nikons d80 will not disappoint
5013647 stunning quality a welcome addition to nikons already superb line
5013648 its 11 point auto focus system is the most sophisticated for the money
5013649 the nikon d80 is a fairly inexpensive digital slr that packs spectacular performance and excellent image quality into a well built solid camera
5013650 the new nikon d80s combination of high end features and its 18 135mm dx kits lens make a killer photographic tool for the amateur and intermediate photographer
5013651 the pentax k200d is a good entry level digital slr that captures enough detail for poster sized prints and allows for an incredible degree of control
5013652 looks like a pretty good camera in its price range
5013653 a proprietary shake reduction system has been incorporated along with auto picture and various scene modes
5013654 blurred hand held photographs particularly with telephotos or longer exposure times are a thing of the past
5013655 designed mainly for family users and digital camera beginners this model offers a host of user friendly features and sophisticated functions like higher class models
5013656 its the big one the latest installment in canons digital rebel series of cameras which blends the professional power of canons 40d with the user friendly presentation of the digital rebel line
5013657 it has live view mode this is the best yet
5013658 it also gains spot metering a first for one of canons baby dslrs
5013659 the xsi is the fastest firing rebel model to date capable of continuously capturing 3 5 frames per second
5013660 a real improvement over the xti in terms of features and usability
5013661 a nice body design and good image quality make the dmc l10 an enticing entry level slr but a pricey kit lens makes this kit too expensive
5013662 with the l10 panasonic has created the closest thing to a point and shoot experience on a dslr that ive seen
5013663 under the skin the lumix l10 is a lot more than a simple cost cutting of the original model dmc l1 some of the features really appear to stand out from the crowd especially those related to the cameras live view mode
5013664 the panasonic lumix dmc l10 incorporates a face detection function a first in digital slr cameras that helps the camera to recognize a human face to capture it bright and clear up to 15 human faces can be detected simultaneously
5013665 but the problem facing panasonic is that the l10 is too expensive to compete in the growing entry level 10mp slr market and nowhere near well specified enough to play with the big boys in the enthusiast semi pro market its price pushes it towards
5013666 an improved dust proof and water resistant construction ensures that the camera stays clean and functional under even the toughest conditions
5013667 the controls are easy to reach and master and menus are even clearer on the 2 7 inch screen with its wide viewing angle and 230 000 dot resolution
5013668 would it have been too difficult to fit a 3 inch screen then they could have given it a better pixel count than 230 000 keeping it in line with the newer dslrs from other manufacturers
5013669 one of the more interesting features of the k20ds live view lcd is the viewfinders 4x to 8x digital zoom when framing a shot with an lcd viewfinder it can be extremely convenient and because the zoom is strictly on the viewfinder the image quality is not degraded
5013670 the pentax k20d is the first dslr weve encountered that offers the ability to adjust the representation of color on its screen allowing the user to calibrate the screen to more accurately reflect the output or the users tastes
5013671 if youre looking for a 10 megapixel camera that can fire long bursts is compatible with a mature system of professional accessories and creates superb images in almost any light look no further
5013672 the new canon 40d offers a very mature set of features in a camera thats priced lower than its predecessors it also offers as much value and image quality as competing designs that are hundreds of dollars more
5013673 the rebel xti is a better camera to throw into a bag if you think that you might want to take a picture
5013674 the bottom line is that the canon 40d is the most dslr for the money that canon has ever offered
5013675 when i first started using the eos 40d a simple description came to mind that this is a well sorted camera
5013676 the a700 doesnt feel anywhere near as solid as competitors like the virtually bombproof olympus e 3 or canon eos 40d
5013677 id say that both nikon and canon have good reason to be worried the a700 is an extremely impressive camera both in the flesh and on paper
5013678 like most new dslrs sonys made the jump in screen size to 3in but fitted the a700 with a super high resolution model sporting 640 480 resolution which is four times finer than typical 230k screens
5013679 on the negative side there are some quirky design decisions which may or may not affect you
5013680 if youve got a bunch of minolta lenses waiting for a capable body to attach themselves to then this is your camera even if you dont the dslr a700 is a very good midrange d slr that should definitely be considered
5013681 despite some interface quirks and a slightly awkward design the olympus e3 fares quite well against its midrange dslr competition
5013682 this new olympus flagship dslr proves that the four thirds system has a bona fide place in the pro and advanced amateur photographers kit
5013683 if you want virtually total control this is your camera
5013684 billed as a pure pro camera the olympus e 3 is more comparable to the cameras that weve been categorizing as semi pro whatever you call it though theres no question that the new e 3 represents a sizable leap forward in technology and sophistication for the olympus slr line
5013685 those looking to get involved with high end or professional photography should pay special attention to this camera
5013686 the d300 beats both the d40 and the a700 in terms of high iso performance
5013687 the nikon d300 slr digital camera offers outstanding image quality multi functional technologies and fast response
5013688 no camera both refines and redefines photography as well as the nikon d300
5013689 if photographers like any artist are going to continue to invest and create and be involved and if the business want to see the types of images from professional photographers that are really extraordinary then they are going to have to support the artists
5013690 unfortunately we need to be paid to survive i have seen very little evidence if any that anyone can thrive on a microstock income
5013691 my fees are dropping i presented that to the agencies that sell the photos and said this is a problem there is nothing they can do about it it is not their problem it gets transferred to me the crew the models the locations
5013692 money enhanced individualism but diminished communal motivations an effect that is still apparent in peoples responses today
5013693 violence in iraq has declined sharply over the past year following a u s troop buildup a sunni revolt against al qaida in iraq and a shiite militia cease fire
5013694 afp also reports that in baghdads jadid district iraqi forces arrested the head of an awakening council for involvement in terrorism and conducted a raid on guerrillas so that 250 displaced persons could return to the neighborhood
5013695 my guess is that this translates that at least some members of the sunni awakening council had earlier been involved in ethnically cleansing shiites and that the al maliki government is now cracking down on it so that some shiite families can safely return

5013698 who would have thought that the apa whose code of ethics mandates a respect for basic principles of human rights and holds psychologists to a higher standard of conduct than is required by the law would be so reluctant to prohibit psychologists from participating in interrogations from guant namo to abu ghraib
5013699 the apa has justified this policy of engagement by stating its involvement is intended to stop unethical interrogations
5013700 no psychologist apa member or not should be directly or indirectly involved in any form of detention or interrogation that could lead to psychological or physical harm to a detainee doing so would be a clear violation of the professions ethical standards

5013708 there is no question from now on when people think of the greatest swimmer of all time its only going to be michael phelps name that comes to their lips
5013709 he won eight gold medals he deserves to be remembered as the hero of the beijing olympics
5013710 that will be when you win everything and overwhelm the position that will be a phelpsian achievement
5013711 this is all a dream come true you know to really just imagination anything and works towards it
5013712 to accomplish everything youve really ever dreamed of its fun
5013713 its phenomenal and i think in my opinion well never ever see it again i just dont think that can be emulated or beaten
5013714 what im looking forward to is not doing anything just sitting and not moving
5013715 i expect that theres a lot of kids around the country if not around the world who will next week make a pilgrimage to the local swimming pool and ask if theres a signup sheet for the swim team because theres going be a lot of people who want to be just like michael phelps

5013720 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5013721 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5013889 we came out really strong in the first game of the first match then we took a nose dive and got on a rollercoaster ride we tried to fight back but nothing was working for us

5013907 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women i felt she was the most experienced and the best candidate and i still feel that way
5013908 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning chances are shes not going to have as many delegates vote for her on the floor as she had in the primary
5013909 i think that most superdelegates including myself are going for obama
5013910 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
5013911 my boss is totally conflicted about it and pissed hillary is putting us in this position

5014039 this might and i stress might be something to do with the increased exposure of young children to unsupervised and lengthy hours in front of a screen

5014131 de neocons zionisten echter zijn de zelfde families die direct verantwoordelijk waren voor wwii en daar nooit voor gestraft zijn het is de vraag hoe lang je wilt associeren als premier van nederland met deze genocide plegers nu even voor de duidelijkheid u zult zeggen hoe kunnen de joden met de familie rothschilds als joodse hoofdorganisatoren nu wwii gecreerd hebben dat is toch compleet tegenstrijdig met het vergasssen van 6 millioen joden in diezelfde wwii door de nazis het impliceert dat de rothshilds nazis waren en dat kan niet want het zijn joden punt is dat de familie rothschilds geen oorspronkelijke joden zijn maar afstammen van een heidense stam uit rusland de kazaren die zich rond 800 ad bekeerd hebben tot het jodendom zoek het op op het internet al het geld en bezittingen van het vaticaan zijn nu in hun bezit en hun enige echte ideologie is dan ook het promoten van al het belang van het vaticaan ze verschuilen zich achter het joodse volk en noemen zich zionisten maar in werkelijkheid misbruiken ze het joodse volk voor hun vaticaan en machts ideologie joodse rabies de spirituele erfgenamen en enige rechthebbende om het judaisme uit te dragen staan lijnrecht tegenover de zionisten en zijn woest op hun

5014140 but you have to live with this the longing longing for what what is longing ever for but the intangible and unnameable it is somewhere in the night smell of coal smoke and fog and suppers as she walks back to great russell street after the theatre and in the sounds the clank of the sausage vendors shutting up their ovens the first rumble of the vegetable carts the pointed tap of feet ascending steps to a front door the thump of the door closing on the world it is somewhere in the lowered young eyes of the city clerk at the chop house who alwyas lingers over his small plate of a la mode beef for a solitary precious hour somewhere likewise in the self possession of the flautist in the drury lane orchestra thin as his flute coat shiny at the elbows who always arrives early and plays sad beautiful airs to himself and the great receiving emptiness of the auditorium a shepherd in a gilded and plastered grove and on summer tours it shimmers in the hayfields and in the distant towns that sail into view a flotilla of roofs cathedral spires like great masts it is there in the provincial theatres in the excited family in the disty peeling box that look in the gangling boy and the big chinned girl of an unexpected goodness on the road it is in the ambling gait of the turnpike0keeper coming out of his toll house still chewing his dinner and in the wonder that quite randomly you were born yourself and not him and what it must be like to be him what it must be like what everything must be like

5014143 it seems to be working a lot of world records have been broken every sport has been able to advance the technology and i think swimming has found its new thing
5014144 it is definitely not a level playing field if you look at the swimmers who are contracted to wear the suit its like most of them come from america and australia which are the swimming powerhouses definitely they are going to win the races if they use the lzr and its not going to be a fair playing field at the olympics so it will be a war of wealth instead of talent which is what sports is all about in my opinion
5014145 im all for technology and the advancement of equipment and things like that but i think the olympic idea is to allow people to test their bodies against other athletes it shouldnt be in my mind about who has the best equipment it should be who trains the best
5014146 you cant really compete in most of the events in the olympics unless you have very sophisticated training facilities and expensive technology thats just the way the world is i dont think thats anymore unfair than people getting access to better computers or education or health care some people equate fairness with complete equality but i personally dont
5014147 team sports like cricket should not be included in the olympics olympics is a personal game where sportsman tries to excel within himself
5014148 it would be unfair to include cricket in the olympics as the players of other sports especially of individual events wait for the single day to happen and show their talents
5014149 hampers other sports but it is the governments who should take corrective measures to ensure that individual sports also get their due
5014150 can you create a market for cricket in places like the usa and china by playing at the olympics or do you first try to make the citizens of those countries more aware of the game so there is then a demand for it at olympic level
5014151 we the first presidency and the council of the twelve apostles of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of god and that the family is central to the creator s plan for the eternal destiny of his children the family is ordained of god marriage between man and woman is essential to his eternal plan children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity

5014672 kakek nenek tolong beritahu kepada kami resep akur dan cara kakek dan nenek mempertahan cinta selama ini agar kami yang muda muda bisa belajar
5014673 ini pengalaman kakek dan nenek yang tak mungkin terlupakan dan rasanya perlu kalian dengar dengan baik suatu hari kami berdua terlibat obrolan tentang sebuah artikel di majalah yang berjudul bagaimana memperkuat tali pernikahan di sana dituliskan masing masing dari kita diminta mencatat hal hal yang kurang disukai dari pasangan kita kemudian dibahas cara untuk mengubahnya agar ikatan tali pernikahan bisa lebih kuat dan bahagia nah malam itu kami sepakat berpisah kamar dan mencatat apa saja yang tidak disukai esoknya selesai sarapan nenek memulai lebih dulu membacakan daftar dosa kakekmu sepanjang kurang lebih tiga halaman kalau dipikir pikir ternyata banyak juga dan herannya lagi sebegitu banyak yang tidak disukai tetapi tetap saja kakek kalian menjadi suami tercinta nenekmu ini
5014674 nenek membacanya hingga selesai dan kelelahan dan sekarang giliran kakekmu yang melanjutakan bercerita
5014675 pagi itu kakek membawa kertas juga tetapi kosong kakek tidak mencatat sesuatu pun di kertas itu kakek merasa nenekmu adalah wanita yang kakek cintai apa adanya kakek tidak ingin mengubahnya sedikit pun nenekmu cantik baik hati dan mau menikahi kakekmu ini itu sudah lebih dari cukup bagi kakek
5014676 nenek sungguh sangat tersentuh oleh pernyataan kakekmu itu sehingga sejak saat itu tidak ada masalah atau sesuatu apa pun yang cukup besar yang dapat menyebabkan kami bertengkar dan mengurangi perasaan cinta kami berdua

5014764 sie sind ungl cklich so wie andere menschen mit etwas in ihrem leben unzufrieden sind doch sie haben sich oft auch schon mit ihrem leben ohne partner arrangiert
5014765 ich war lange zeit nicht wirklich ungl cklich mit meiner situation aber seit einigen jahren tut es richtig weh wenn ich sonntags alleine durch den park spaziere und die ganzen paare sehe dann sehne ich mich besonders stark nach einer eigenen beziehung

5014767 we affirm that the bible is also the final measurement and depository of certain fundamental facts of reality and basic principles in the sphere of law government economics business education arts and communication medicine psychology and science all theories and practices of these spheres of life are only true right and realistic to the degree that they agree with the bible
5014768 should a conflict arise between the witness of the holy spirit to the fundamental truth of the christian faith and beliefs based on argument and evidence then it is the former which must take precedence over the latter not vice versa
5014769 i remember coming here and it was all about alternative lifestyles now its calmer the restaurants are very kid welcoming

5014772 we cannot overstate that problems in remote parts of the globe can no longer be ignored diseases that americans once read about as affecting people in regions most of us would never visit are now capable of reaching us directly the hunger disease and death resulting from poor food and nutrition create social and political instability and that instability may spread to other nations as people migrate to survive
5014773 this will be a political document or it will not be released
5014774 while we believe the subject matter of the draft is important we disagree with the style tone and messaging
5014775 we believe this document should be focused tightly on the administrations major priorities in global health so the american public can understand better why these issues should be important to them as such the draft should be a policy statement albeit one that is evidence based and draws on the best available science
5014776 the public health community has embraced the concept that violence and injuries are predictable and preventable
5014777 hey i think babies are cute is too specific and may not play well in the baby hating demographic can we tone it down

5014780 for a judicial body to rule that a book chosen by so many canadians was beyond the bounds of acceptable discourse in canada would be a remarkable and unprecedented blow to freedom of speech in a western democracy

5014784 an al qaeda front that receives funding from wealthy saudi businessmen
5014785 reportedly transferred at least 3 million on behalf of khalid bin mahfouz to osama bin laden
5014786 i have written often and loudly about threats to free speech both here and in other countries in some cases commenters have criticized me for criticizing other countries like canada and the uk for their anti free speech policies their argument generally is that those nations passed those laws democratically so obviously their citizens feel that those laws are reasonable who am i after all to tell them theyre wrong i have reacted to such criticism with all of the derision that such an argument deserves which is a lot
5014787 im not defending uk libel law but if im reading it correctly somins proposal is almost as unfair as the uk law itself there are plenty of libel suits that have merit but would still fall foul of the first amendment in the us it hardly seems right to punish plaintiffs who have a very good case in their own country
5014788 the burden of proof is put too heavily on the defendant and this leads to ridiculous situations like the original archer trial
5014789 i honestly doubted there was anyone stupid enough to attempt such a shallow argument then john doe arrived and immediately obliged

5015229 ich bin gespannt wie sehr sich wilhelmsburg in den augen der hamburger ver ndert
5015230 woanders h tte ich mir ein eigenes caf einfach nicht leisten k nnen deshalb bin ich hierher gegangen trotz der vorurteile die ich hatte

5015236 they say your best defense is your offense and thats very true with our team
5015237 all through our lineup everyone can be a threat in so many ways weve got speed power you name it its nice to pitch for them they score so many runs we as pitchers dont want to let them down

5015247 my inspiration was youtorrent com before it sailed to clean waters
5015248 it is simple to use responsive and has loads of good results for almost any search query at that time i didnt know about other similar meta search engines so i decided id try to make one myself mostly for fun
5015249 i have not yet made a complete wish list but btmon com bitenova nl and torrentbox com will definitely be added in september
5015250 worst case scenario is that ill have to move it to a server in a less strict country

5015253 es hat sich gezeigt dass mehr als 90 prozent dieser vorschriften problemlos wegfallen k nnen
5015254 deshalb werden die fraktionen von cdu und fdp einen gesetzentwurf einbringen der diese erfolgreiche flexibilisierung dann ab dem n chsten jahr f r alle landkreise und gemeinden in niedersachsen festschreibt

5015264 as im kind of six songs deep im kind of like oh ok
5015265 now that this sort of has this pattern or this trend ive written in and ive touched on 50s 60s 70s i thought ok lets see what we can come up with that has an 80s flair to it
5015266 i really wanted to be a part of it but i also knew that i really needed to focus
5015267 i had to make a choice because i wanted to make sure that all of my attention would be put towards one thing
5015268 i know that i need a certain amount of attention as an artist its like you got to know what your worth is you know
5015269 she looked into my eyes and she said as long as your intent is pure you will not be denied and thats something that has stayed with me forever
5015270 she was like an angel that was sent from the creative forces of the universe to say hey girl dont give up
5015271 i think we have to start getting ready im really thinking we have three quarterbacks who can play and it wouldnt surprise me if all three of them play during the season that wouldnt shock me in the least what we have to do is get one we can win with and hopefully we can with all three of them

5015273 guerra entre rusia y georgia por la invasi n rusa de osetia del sur
5015274 las claves para entender la guerra entre rusia y georgia por osetia
5015275 breve explicaci n de la situaci n en el c ucaso el conflicto entre georgia y osetia del sur estaba hasta ahora entre los llamados conflictos congelados es decir entre esos conflictos cuya soluci n est acordada en la osce organizaci n para la seguridad y la cooperaci n en europa pero en los que no se dan pasos reales ni hacia la mejora n
5015276 according to the information i have available to me this russian withdrawal has not yet begun
5015277 this the proposal nato extend a formal invitation for georgia to embark on nato accession will of course come up for review in december and we will look at this very closely
5015278 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

5015280 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5015281 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5015282 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5015283 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5015284 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5015285 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5015286 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5015287 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5015288 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5015289 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5015290 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5015291 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5015292 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5015293 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5015294 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5015295 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5015296 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5015297 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5015298 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5015299 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5015300 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5015301 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5015302 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5015303 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5015304 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5015305 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5015306 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5015307 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5015308 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5015309 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5015310 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5015311 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5015312 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5015313 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5015314 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5015315 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5015316 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5015317 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5015318 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5015319 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5015320 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5015321 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5015322 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5015323 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5015324 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5015325 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5015326 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5015327 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5015328 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5015329 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5015330 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5015331 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5015332 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5015333 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5015334 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5015335 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5015336 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5015337 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5015338 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5015339 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5015340 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5015341 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5015342 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5015343 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5015344 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5015345 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5015346 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5015347 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5015348 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5015349 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5015350 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5015351 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5015352 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5015353 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5015354 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5015355 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5015356 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5015357 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5015358 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche

5015360 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5015361 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5015362 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5015363 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5015364 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5015365 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

5015369 has all the elements of the next michael bay blockbuster including a couple of critics to review it weve got the links to all that and more on the next page but first
5015370 penny jumped on its the bear back and comments are moderated by cnn in accordance with the news to me
5015371 oh that cute guy was so sweet because he helped me out
5015372 mail appears to be taking longer to load than usual

5015376 though the channel is still fairly new were confident that it will grow in terms of presence and revenue
5015377 the channel will also work as a means to promote thai films we plan to put at least 400 films into the channel in the next 10 months
5015378 public money public employee time public buildings equipment and supplies
5015379 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5015380 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5015381 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5015382 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5015383 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5015384 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5015385 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5015386 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5015387 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5015388 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5015389 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5015390 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5015391 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5015392 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5015393 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5015394 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5015395 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5015396 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5015397 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5015398 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5015399 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5015400 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5015401 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5015402 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5015403 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5015404 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5015405 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5015406 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5015407 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5015408 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5015409 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5015410 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5015411 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5015412 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5015413 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5015414 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5015415 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5015416 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5015417 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5015418 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5015419 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5015420 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5015421 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5015422 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5015423 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

5015427 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5015428 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5015429 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5015430 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5015431 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5015432 the caliber of submissions this year was truly phenomenal which made the jurys job especially difficult
5015433 the winners truly showcase what is possible today and provide a glimpse into what artists can achieve in the future really the only limitation is the imagination
5015434 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5015435 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5015436 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5015437 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5015438 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5015439 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5015440 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5015441 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5015442 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5015443 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5015444 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5015445 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5015446 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5015447 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

5015454 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5015455 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5015456 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5015457 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5015458 we are continuing to invest heavily in our branch and business centre network throughout ireland

5015494 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5015495 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5015496 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5015497 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato
5015498 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear

5015541 upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jurys deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other jurors mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning the jurors mental processes in connection therewith but a juror may testify about 1 whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jurys attention 2 whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror or 3 whether there was a mistake in entering the verdict onto the verdict form
5015542 the ninth circuit directs the trial court to consider the following factors to determine whether a new trial is warranted
5015543 there was no discussion or consideration of the substance of juror no 8s remarks

5015556 i didnt even tell my mum until after the fight
5015557 the people i told all kind of reacted like you fighting chop chop he went twelve with floyd mayweather and rocked him and he shock up miguel cotto but i believe in me and i know who i can beat a lot of them top boys i spar with wbc number four ajose olusegun all the time so i know how to fight southpaws so i was very confident
5015558 i basically saw that demarcus corley was fighting in 10 days on the internet so i got my adviser stacy warren from hoodstripes entertainment to contact them i was weighing 151lbs but got my weight down just in time
5015559 boxing trainer john tandy who i was working with in camp knew i wanted the fight when he saw me using my right hand on pads on our last day working together
5015560 i was training for three weeks in newark new jersey and couldnt use my right hand as it was hurting too much
5015561 if corley wasnt a southpaw it wouldnt have bothered me but i knew i could hit him all day long with my right hand southpaws dont bother me
5015562 thats a call out right there to them top southpaws hoodstars coming for you baby
5015563 i 100 believed in myself i was at his last fight in madison square garden against wbc number one devon alexander and i knew i had what he takes to beat both of them i did a better job than alexander if i had 12 rounds chop chop would have been chopped down and stopped this is why i got involved in boxing to fight the big names
5015564 chop chop had don turner as his coach and they where saying they going to whoop my ass they where asking the waitress at the hotel what i was eating i didnt care what they where eating cause i knew i eat real good
5015565 he didnt say much his whole team thought i was his way back into the big time but i knew he was my ticket he was stronger than i thought he would be
5015566 people look at my record and think i dont want to fight no one or think i have been carried but they dont know that i have been self managed for four years three years officially so i have never had a promoter or manager really i have financed myself to where i am now
5015567 i aint supposed to be here in this position many people would have given up i could be dead or in jail or even on the block but i chose this path and this is what i am focusing on
5015568 i think it did help the first fight i did in germany i was more nervous than this i enjoyed the whole build up to this fight people thinking chop chop was going to knock me out i even enjoyed chop chops ring entrance the crowd was chanting his name and the first three rounds chanting usa usa but i made them go quiet as round by round i broke him down i was smiling to myself
5015569 i think my defence which is normally my strength wasnt too much there but i wasnt fighting the typical hoodstar way
5015570 i thanked him and told him i had watched all his big fights and it was an honour to share a ring with him i want the big fights he has had and i am very sure they will come
5015571 its funny im born and bred in london but the only promoters who have shown an interest in signing me are jonathan feld wso and frank maloney so i have to say they know talent but the others i wont mention names dont want a lawsuit jh neither does bbn thanks
5015572 they sign people like barry morrison colin lynes gavin rees david barnes and lenny daws but they wouldnt sign me how funny is that
5015573 there are some offers on the table still early stages but some us promoters are interested in working with me
5015574 ali oubaali what can i say the us boxing press liked me but people in the us who seen me sparring these world ranked fighters knew that wasnt me that turned up i fought the wrong fight the first few rounds and played catch up some journalists still gave me the fight
5015575 it happens the best in the world have lost roy jones jr marvin hagler pernell whitaker but its how they come back so it happens but i came back and came back big
5015576 i was supposed to go camp with dmitriy salita but corley burst my ear drum so just ticking over doing some yoga and pilates i am in the us for another month maybe tying up a promotional deal there maybe some big news real soon
5015577 the reason i came to the us is because i was supposed to sign a management deal with a company but we saw my future differently thats why i left camp and fought corley its funny how things work out
5015578 bridge academy amp fox primary school are two schools i work regularly with but its also nice sometimes to work with the youth when i can especially youth that come from my background
5015579 last year i spent four months abroad this year out of the eight months i have been abroad for four months and i could be coming back again this year it makes me appreciate the people in my life more and i love travelling life is too short to be bored i try to make the most out of life happiness is important to me and i love my job i have met so many cool people and been all over the world through boxing
5015580 i have never been a fan of amateur boxing but always followed the americans and cubans i like stylish boxing

5015587 people putting on 3 d glasses or paying a little extra to see a movie in 3 d at this point in cinema are expecting to have things blatantly launched into the audience

5015592 el objeto producido por el trabajo su producto se enfrenta a l como algo extra o como un poder independiente del productor la enajenaci n del obrero en su producto no s lo significa que su trabajo se convierte en un objeto en una existencia externa sino que esta existencia se halla fuera de l es independiente de l y ajena a l y representa frente a l un poder propio y sustantivo
5015593 algo que caracteriza al trabajo que crea valor de cambio es que la relaci n social de las personas se presenta por as decirlo invertida vale decir como una relaci n social de las cosas todas las ilusiones del sistema monetario derivan del hecho de que al dinero no se le reconoce como una relaci n de producci n social
5015594 en nuestra sociedad la forma m s general y simple que adoptan los productos del trabajo la forma mercanc a es tan familiar para todos que nadie ve malicia alguna en ello si pudiesen hablar las mercanc as dir an es posible que nuestro valor de uso interese al hombre por nuestra parte como objetos ello nos tiene sin cuidado lo que nos importa es nuestro valor as lo demuestra nuestra relaci n entre nosotras como cosas de venta y compra s lo nos vemos unas a otras como valores de cambio
5015595 las mercanc a no pueden ir por s mismas al mercado ni por s mismas intercambiarse unas por otras por lo tanto debemos dirigir la mirada hacia sus guardianes y conductores es decir hacia sus poseedores las mercanc as son cosas y por consiguiente no oponen al hombre resistencia alguna si carecen de buena voluntad ste puede emplear la fuerza o en otros t rminos apoderarse de ellas para poner estas cosas en relaci n unas con otras su propios guardianes deben relacionarse entre s como personas cuya voluntad habita en las cosas mismas
5015596 la crisis precapitalista es una crisis de subproducci n de valores de uso por el contrario la crisis capitalista es una crisis de sobreproducci n de valores de cambio se explica por la insuficiencia no de la producci n o de la capacidad f sica de consumo sino de la capacidad de pago del consumidor una abundancia relativa de mercanc as no encuentra su equivalente en el mercado no puede realizar su valor de cambio resulta invendible y arrastra a sus propietarios a la ruina
5015597 s lo una organizaci n consciente de la producci n social en la que se produzca y se distribuya con arreglo a un plan podr elevar a los hombres en el campo de las relaciones sociales sobre el resto del mundo animal en la misma medida en que la producci n en general lo ha hecho con arreglo a la especie humana y el desarrollo hist rico hace que semejante organizaci n sea cada d a m s inexcusable y al mismo tiempo m s posible de ella datar una nueva poca de la historia en la que los hombres mismos y con ellos todas las ramas de sus actividades incluyendo especialmente las ciencias naturales alcanzar n un auge que relegar a la sombra m s profunda todo cuanto hoy conocemos

5015662 i had a little bit of hope inside of me
5015663 but seeing how beautifully she executed her routine i knew
5015664 after the all around i was excited to have made the floor finals and a bronze medal feels great
5015665 today i concentrated only on my moves not the medals
5015666 i felt that i had a very normal performance without surprises and that is why i got a silver medal
5015667 im disappointed especially since third place had a fall and i made both of mine
5015668 i cant change her score the judges made up their minds
5015669 i definitely had to pull myself together a little bit the last few days
5015670 im sure someday ill appreciate what i did i still have to get to that step
5015671 it is amazing to go to three olympics and get three medals
5015672 i was nervous when i was watching the other gymnasts competing after me
5015673 this is a competition so two or three mistakes are pretty common i was struggling during those 10 minutes i was worried that i wouldnt get the gold medal
5015674 i had faith that this eventually would happen its an incredible emotional experience to see two men i know and love finally get married
5015675 im really happy for them that theyre able to seal a union thats been long and wonderful they really love each other
5015676 i thought he was attractive and i liked his eyes
5015677 people think of love as a feeling but feelings come and go
5015678 when you approach love as a commitment then you achieve permanence i reached a point when i realized this is a relationship i wanted to last
5015679 i remain very hopeful that voters in this state will understand that love and commitment fairness and equality are values important regardless of sexual orientation
5015680 were neighbors were friends and were co workers people know us and it would be awfully hard for folks to say we shouldnt have the right to love and have a commitment

5015686 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5015687 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5015688 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5015689 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5015690 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5015691 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5015692 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5015693 who are open to doing something on the production side
5015694 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5015695 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5015696 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5015697 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5015698 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5015699 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5015700 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5015701 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5015702 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5015703 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5015704 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5015705 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5015706 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5015707 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5015708 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5015709 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5015710 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5015711 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5015712 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5015713 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5015714 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5015715 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5015716 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5015717 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5015718 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5015719 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5015720 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5015721 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5015722 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5015723 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5015724 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5015725 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5015726 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5015727 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5015728 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5015729 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5015730 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5015731 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5015732 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5015733 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5015734 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5015735 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5015736 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5015737 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5015738 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5015739 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5015740 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5015741 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5015742 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5015743 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5015744 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5015745 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5015746 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5015747 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5015748 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5015749 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5015750 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5015751 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5015752 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5015753 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5015754 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5015755 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5015756 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5015757 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5015758 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5015759 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5015760 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5015761 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5015762 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

5015768 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5015769 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5015770 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5015771 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5015772 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5015773 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

5015779 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5015784 i really wanted to be a part of it but i also knew that i really needed to focus
5015785 i had to make a choice because i wanted to make sure that all of my attention would be put towards one thing

5015797 my hair and make up artists spend hours upon hours plastering things on me to make me look sexier i think its rare that you feel beautiful
5015798 i cant wait to be married i feel like it is long overdue and i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous like we all dont have the same rights

5015802 thats something that has played out in the press thats not my view
5015803 i do think it was indicative of the perspective that she brings which is that what happens in washington is more important than what happens outside of washington
5015804 that the intricacies of the legislative process were somehow more significant than when ordinary people rise up and march and go to jail and fight for justice

5015814 john mccain continues to hear the concerns of rural families thats why he has made every effort to engage these voters on his plans to create jobs and provide relief for working families

5015879 we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark
5015880 oh no nothing of that nature the fact is the business is very simple indeed and i make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves but then i thought dupin would like to hear the details of it because it is so excessively odd
5015881 why yes and not exactly that either the fact is we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple and yet baffles us altogether
5015882 perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault
5015883 oh good heavens who ever heard of such an idea
5015884 oh dupin you will be the death of me yet
5015885 i will tell you in a few words but before i begin let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy and that i should most probably lose the position i now hold were it known that i confided it to any one
5015886 well then i have received personal information from a very high quarter that a certain document of the last importance has been purloined from the royal apartments the individual who purloined it is known this beyond a doubt he was seen to take it it is known also that it still remains in his possession
5015887 from the nature of the document and from the nonappearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robbers possession that is to say from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it
5015888 well i may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable
5015889 no well the disclosure of the document to a third person who shall be nameless would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted station and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized
5015890 would depend upon the robbers knowledge of the losers knowledge of the robber
5015891 you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete the robbers knowledge of the losers knowledge of the robber
5015892 and the power thus attained has for some months past been wielded for political purposes to a very dangerous extent the personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced every day of the necessity of reclaiming her letter but this of course cannot be done openly in fine driven to despair she has committed the matter to me
5015893 no more sagacious agent could i suppose be desired or even imagined
5015894 but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained
5015895 as you observe that the letter is still in possession of the minister since it is this possession and not any employment of the letter which bestows the power with the employment the power departs
5015896 and upon this conviction i proceeded my first care was to make thorough search of the ministers hotel and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge beyond all things i have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design
5015897 you are quite au fait in these investigations the parisian police have done this thing often before
5015898 oh yes and for this reason i did not despair the habits of the minister gave me too a great advantage he is frequently absent from home all night his servants are by no means numerous they sleep at a distance from their masters apartment and being chiefly neapolitans are readily made drunk i have keys as you know with which i can open any chamber or cabinet in paris for three months a night has not passed during the greater part of which i have not been engaged personally in ransacking the d hotel my honor is interested and to mention a great secret the reward is enormous so i did not abandon the search until i had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself i fancy that i have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed
5015899 that although the letter may be in possession of the minister as it unquestionably is he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises
5015900 the present peculiar condition of affairs at court and especially of those intrigues in which d is known to be involved would render the instant availability of the document its susceptibility of being produced at a moments notice a point of nearly equal importance with its possession
5015901 the paper is clearly then upon the premises as for its being upon the person of the minister we may consider that as out of the question
5015902 he has been twice waylaid as if by footpads and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection
5015903 d i presume is not altogether a fool and if not must have anticipated these waylayings as a matter of course
5015904 but then hes a poet which i take to be only one remove from a fool
5015905 why the fact is we took our time and we searched every where i have had long experience in these affairs i took the entire building room by room devoting the nights of a whole week to each we examined first the furniture of each apartment we opened every possible drawer and i presume you know that to a properly trained police agent such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible any man is a dolt who permits a secret drawer to escape him in a search of this kind the thing is so plain there is a certain amount of bulk of space to be accounted for in every cabinet then we have accurate rules the fiftieth part of a line could not escape us after the cabinets we took the chairs the cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ from the tables we removed the tops
5015906 sometimes the top of a table or other similarly arranged piece of furniture is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article then the leg is excavated the article deposited within the cavity and the top replaced the bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way
5015907 by no means if when the article is deposited a sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it besides in our case we were obliged to proceed without noise
5015908 but you could not have removed you could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention a letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knitting needle and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair for example you did not take to pieces all the chairs
5015909 certainly not but we did better we examined the rungs of every chair in the hotel and indeed the jointings of every description of furniture by the aid of a most powerful microscope had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly a single grain of gimlet dust for example would have been as obvious as an apple any disorder in the glueing any unusual gaping in the joints would have sufficed to insure detection
5015910 i presume you looked to the mirrors between the boards and the plates and you probed the beds and the bed clothes as well as the curtains and carpets
5015911 that of course and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way then we examined the house itself we divided its entire surface into compartments which we numbered so that none might be missed then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises including the two houses immediately adjoining with the microscope as before
5015912 all the grounds are paved with brick they gave us comparatively little trouble we examined the moss between the bricks and found it undisturbed
5015913 you looked among d s papers of course and into the books of the library
5015914 certainly we opened every package and parcel we not only opened every book but we turned over every leaf in each volume not contenting ourselves with a mere shake according to the fashion of some of our police officers we also measured the thickness of every book cover with the most accurate admeasurement and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope had any of the bindings been recently meddled with it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation some five or six volumes just from the hands of the binder we carefully probed longitudinally with the needles
5015915 beyond doubt we removed every carpet and examined the boards with the microscope
5015916 you have been making a miscalculation and the letter is not upon the premises as you suppose
5015917 and now dupin what would you advise me to do
5015918 i am not more sure that i breathe than i am that the letter is not at the hotel
5015919 you have of course an accurate description of the letter
5015920 well but g what of the purloined letter i presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the minister
5015921 confound him say i yes i made the reexamination however as dupin suggested but it was all labor lost as i knew it would be
5015922 why a very great deal a very liberal reward i dont like to say how much precisely but one thing i will say that i wouldnt mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter the fact is it is becoming of more and more importance every day and the reward has been lately doubled if it were trebled however i could do no more than i have done
5015923 i really think g you have not exerted yourself to the utmost in this matter you might do a little more i think eh
5015924 why puff puff you might puff puff employ counsel in the matter eh puff puff puff do you remember the story they tell of abernethy
5015925 we will suppose said the miser that his symptoms are such and such now doctor what would you have directed him to take
5015926 i am perfectly willing to take advice and to pay for it i would really give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter
5015927 you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned when you have signed it i will hand you the letter
5015928 are exceedingly able in their way they are persevering ingenious cunning and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand thus when g detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the hotel d i felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation so far as his labors extended
5015929 the measures adopted were not only the best of their kind but carried out to absolute perfection had the letter been deposited within the range of their search these fellows would beyond a question have found it
5015930 were good in their kind and well executed their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case and to the man
5015931 an identification of the reasoners intellect with that of his opponent
5015932 of the reasoners intellect with that of his opponent depends if i understand you aright upon the accuracy with which the opponents intellect is admeasured
5015933 there are two brothers i know and both have attained reputation in letters the minister i believe has written learnedly on the differential calculus he is a mathematician and no poet
5015934 you are mistaken i know him well he is both as poet and mathematician he would reason well as mere mathematician he could not have reasoned at all and thus would have been at the mercy of the prefect
5015935 by these opinions which have been contradicted by the voice of the world you do not mean to set at naught the well digested idea of centuries the mathematical reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence
5015936 que toute idee publique toute convention recue est une sottise car elle a convenu au plus grand nombre the mathematicians i grant you have done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth with an art worthy a better cause for example they have insinuated the term analysis into application to algebra the french are the originators of this particular deception but if a term is of any importance if words derive any value from applicability then analysis conveys algebra about as much as in latin ambitus implies ambition religio religion or homines honesti a set of honorable men
5015937 i dispute the availability and thus the value of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical i dispute in particular the reason educed by mathematical study the mathematics are the science of form and quantity mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity the great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra are abstract or general truths and this error is so egregious that i am confounded at the universality with which it has been received mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth what is true of relation of form and quantity is often grossly false in regard to morals for example in this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole in chemistry also the axiom falls in the consideration of motive it falls for two motives each of a given value have not necessarily a value when united equal to the sum of their values apart there are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation but the mathematician argues from his finite truths through habit as if they were of an absolutely general applicability as the world indeed imagines them to be bryant in his very learned mythology mentions an analogous source of error when he says that although the pagan fables are not believed yet we forget ourselves continually and make inferences from them as existing realities with the algebraists however who are pagans themselves the pagan fables are believed and the inferences are made not so much through lapse of memory as through an unaccountable addling of the brains in short i never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x squared px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q say to one of these gentlemen by way of experiment if you please that you believe occasions may occur where x squared px is not altogether equal to q and having made him understand what you mean get out of his reach as speedily as convenient for beyond doubt he will endeavor to knock you down i mean to say
5015938 that if the minister had been no more than a mathematician the prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check i knew him however as both mathematician and poet and my measures were adapted to his capacity with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded i knew him as a courtier too and as a bold intriguant such a man i considered could not fall to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action he could not have failed to anticipate and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate the waylayings to which he was subjected he must have foreseen i reflected the secret investigations of his premises his frequent absences from home at night which were hailed by the prefect as certain aids to his success i regarded only as ruses to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which g in fact did finally arrive the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises i felt also that the whole train of thought which i was at some pains in detailing to you just now concerning the invariable principle of policial action in searches for articles concealed i felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the minister it would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment he could not i reflected be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes to the probes to the gimlets and to the microscopes of the prefect i saw in fine that he would be driven as a matter of course to simplicity if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice you will remember perhaps how desperately the prefect laughed when i suggested upon our first interview that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so very self evident
5015939 i remember his merriment well i really thought he would have fallen into convulsions
5015940 abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial and thus some color of truth has been given to the rhetorical dogma that metaphor or simile may be made to strengthen an argument as well as to embellish a description the principle of the vis inertiae for example seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics it is not more true in the former that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty than it is in the latter that intellects of the vaster capacity while more forcible more constant and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade are yet the less readily moved and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress again have you ever noticed which of the street signs over the shop doors are the most attractive of attention
5015941 but the more i reflected upon the daring dashing and discriminating ingenuity of d upon the fact that the document must always have been at hand if he intended to use it to good purpose and upon the decisive evidence obtained by the prefect that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitarys ordinary search the more satisfied i became that to conceal this letter the minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all
5015942 full of these ideas i prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles and called one fine morning quite by accident at the ministerial hotel
5015943 to be even with him i complained of my weak eyes and lamented the necessity of the spectacles under cover of which i cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the apartment while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host
5015944 i paid special attention to a large writing table near which he sat and upon which lay confusedly some miscellaneous letters and other papers with one or two musical instruments and a few books
5015945 at length my eyes in going the circuit of the room fell upon a trumpery filigree card rack of pasteboard that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantelpiece
5015946 no sooner had i glanced at this letter than i concluded it to be that of which i was in search
5015947 i protracted my visit as long as possible and while i maintained a most animated discussion with the minister on a topic which i knew well had never failed to interest and excite him i kept my attention really riveted upon the letter
5015948 the next morning i called for the snuff box when we resumed quite eagerly the conversation of the preceding day
5015949 the disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket
5015950 is a desperate man and a man of nerve his hotel too is not without attendants devoted to his interests had i made the wild attempt you suggest i might never have left the ministerial presence alive the good people of paris might have heard of me no more but i had an object apart from these considerations you know my political prepossessions in this matter i act as a partisan of the lady concerned for eighteen months the minister has had her in his power she has now him in hers since being unaware that the letter is not in his possession he will proceed with his exactions as if it was thus will he inevitably commit himself at once to his political destruction his downfall too will not be more precipitate than awkward it is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus averni but in all kinds of climbing as catalani said of singing it is far more easy to get up than to come down in the present instance i have no sympathy at least no pity for him who descends he is the monstrum horrendum an unprincipled man of genius i confess however that i should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts when being defied by her whom the prefect terms a certain personage he is reduced to opening the letter which i left for him in the card rack
5015951 why it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank that would have been insulting
5015952 totul ar fi trebuit sa fie sfere dar n a fost n a fost asa
5015953 thought it was a vote to put inspectors back in
5015954 an occupation of undetermined length with undetermined costs and undetermined consequences
5015955 property is not the sacred right when a rich man becomes poor it is a misfortune it is not a moral evil when a poor man becomes destitute it is a moral evil teeming with consequences and injurious to society and morality
5015956 if most of us are ashamed of shabby clothes and shoddy furniture let us be more ashamed of shabby ideas and shoddy philosophies it would be a sad situation if the wrapper were better than the meat wrapped inside it
5015957 both projects are contingent upon the extension of the federal investment tax credit for renewable energy and processes to expedite transmission needs
5015958 which convert sunlight directly into electricity and produce the greatest amounts of power during the afternoons when electricity demand is high
5015959 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
5015960 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
5015961 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
5015962 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
5015963 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
5015964 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
5015965 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them
5015966 i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
5015967 they are doing well but they still need a lot of care
5015968 ethanol is to food shortages as the chevy volt will be to power outages
5015969 there is no nation on earth powerful enough to accomplish our overthrow our destruction should it come at all will be from another quarter from the inattention of the people to the concerns of their government from their carelessness and negligence i must confess that i do apprehend some danger i fear that they may place too implicit a confidence in their public servants and fail properly to scrutinize their conduct that in this way they may be made the dupes of designing men and become the instruments of their own undoing
5015970 do you know what backbiting is it is to say something about your brother that he would dislike
5015971 if what you say about him is true you are backbiting him but if it is not true then you have slandered him
5015972 the muslims are at the losing end of this really hateful attitude the only way to end it is if americans of all backgrounds speak out against it whether it is anti muslim anti semitic or anti black
5015973 porsche blockiert eine einigung seit zw lf monaten wenn herr wiedeking seine blockadepolitik nicht aufgibt gibt es auch keine gespr che mehr
5015974 wenn porsche sich nicht bewegt und zusagt dass es nderungen in diesen punkten gibt dann wird es keine friedensgipfel geben
5015975 certainly weaker euro zone economic growth weaker u s weaker uk is bad news for emerging markets
5015976 i would be surprised if we dont see some weakness over the next six months if not faster than that
5015977 the global economic and financial turmoil is starting to take its toll
5015978 youve got a range of countries that are commodities and oil plays such as brazil and russia and asia which is a purchaser of oil
5015979 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet

5015988 theyre not giving oil to us because they love us they hope to undermine our way of life
5015989 we need someone who will bring the right principles which will mean the right policies
5015990 it was an honor to ride with all of you today
5015991 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
5015992 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
5015993 i had a feeling from the day parcells got hired that this was going to be the case feels your pain sir

5015997 we are going straight to the place and were going to be happy
5015998 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5015999 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5016000 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5016001 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5016002 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5016003 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5016004 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5016005 four key deficits budget savings balance of payments and leadership
5016006 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5016007 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue its immoral to keep kicking the can down the road for younger generations to grapple
5016008 you never know what someone might have done to it when they had it could be keyloggers password sniffers or anything else on that laptop right now
5016009 i am trying to write a simple shell script to run on a cron schedule to ensure that a given process is running and then to take an action based on that result in this case i am attempting to look at sbin pidof to see if a valid value is present for a given process im not sure if this is the best way to accomplish this so im open to other suggestions
5016010 aah yes i love the os on my sony ericsson but i like the apps better on the nokia cant i install nokia apps on my sony
5016011 make it idiot proof and only idiots will use it
5016012 it is unfortunate that allstates disregard of florida law required the office to take the drastic actions that we did in order to bring allstate into compliance
5016013 however the terms agreed to by allstate in the consent order go a long way toward restoring confidence in allstates business practices and will provide a great benefit to their policyholders and future policyholders

5016053 the explanation given by the dmk president and chief minister m karunanidhi that the pmks turn would come only in 2010 is not satisfactory

5016083 on august 21 there will be a national premier of the film in 400 theaters across the nation the film purports to be an entertaining analysis of the serious financial situation facing america regarding its national debt and fiscal irresponsibility
5016084 from its trailer and description it sounds suspiciously like a hokey concoction ala al gores an inconvenient truth put together by louis xvis financial ministers on the eve of the storming of the bastille blaming all our troubles on sunspots or the humble snail darter
5016085 the premier will also feature a live panel discussion after the film of distinguished experts filling in to the suckers who viewed this fiasco what they just saw they include peterson walker billionaire investor warren buffet and cato institute chairman william me too niskanen

5016108 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5016109 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5016110 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5016111 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5016112 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush

5016117 ive taken the action because someone had to this government is trying to force this on the people and someone had to stand up and say that there is no evidence to support it
5016118 on the face of it this applicant would seem to face some insurmountable obstacles in bringing this action
5016119 i want to win if i lose what a tragedy to think about that 2 billion plus that our country will give for no return each year im not going to let that happen without attempting to stop it
5016120 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5016121 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5016122 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5016123 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5016124 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5016125 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5016126 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5016127 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5016128 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5016129 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5016130 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5016131 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5016132 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5016133 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5016134 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5016135 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5016136 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5016137 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5016138 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5016139 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5016140 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5016141 dr paul is non interventionist and does not want us intervening in the affairs of others
5016142 its certainly good to have attention drawn to the issues of the libertarian party
5016143 being a third party candidate is very different a lot of republicans like to donate to republicans you just have to keep on plugging
5016144 it could be that a few thousand votes tip the balance
5016145 our goal is to get the iphone client out as quickly as possible because it does represent a significant percentage of the devices touching our network

5016149 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
5016150 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5016151 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5016152 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5016153 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5016154 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5016155 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5016156 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5016157 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5016158 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5016159 hey asshole im sure you do the exact same thing on aim or msn or in your emails
5016160 its just a bunch of stupid people pseudo communicating with a bunch of other stupid people in a proto language that resembles more what the cave men used to speak than the kings english
5016161 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
5016162 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
5016163 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
5016164 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5016165 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5016166 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5016167 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5016168 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5016169 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5016170 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5016171 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5016172 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5016173 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5016174 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5016175 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
5016176 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
5016177 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
5016178 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
5016179 es war nicht leichter f r mich als bei meinen siegen zuvor
5016180 ich habe auf den ersten pr fungen am freitag richtig gas gegeben und bin dabei auch einige risiken eingegangen am letzten tag habe ich nat rlich keine risiken mehr auf mich genommen
5016181 ich w rde aber schon gerne einmal auch gewinnen aber das ist gegen s bastien praktisch nicht m glich
5016182 an den ersten beiden tagen war das auto ziemlich schwierig zu fahren
5016183 wenn ich nur ein bisschen schneller gefahren h tte dies bestimmt in einem abflug geendet
5016184 es war positiv dass wir uns um verlauf der rallye steigern konnten
5016185 wir hatten schlie lich vor der rallye nur zwei tage auf asphalt getestet
5016186 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5016187 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5016188 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
5016189 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
5016190 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
5016191 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
5016192 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
5016193 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
5016194 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
5016195 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
5016196 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
5016197 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
5016198 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
5016199 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
5016200 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
5016201 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
5016202 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills
5016203 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5016204 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5016205 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
5016206 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
5016207 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
5016208 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5016209 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5016210 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5016211 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5016212 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
5016213 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
5016214 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
5016215 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
5016216 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5016217 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5016218 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5016219 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5016220 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5016221 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5016222 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5016223 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5016224 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5016225 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5016226 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5016227 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5016228 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5016229 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5016230 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5016231 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5016232 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
5016233 im the one who tells wolf blitzer hey out of the break were going to call indiana im sort of the final decider in the chain
5016234 miss ive got a free spin card with your name on it

5016236 im sorry but i cannot accept get lost game show boy unless its phrased in the form of a question
5016237 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
5016238 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
5016239 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
5016240 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
5016241 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
5016242 these solutions are flexible the student will be moving a few times throughout college and you want something that can be adjusted to different places
5016243 mensaje de tranquilidad a los ciudadanos y de confianza en el trabajo de las fuerzas de seguridad del estado
5016244 la banda criminal da una muestra m s de su nulo respeto ante la vida y la libertad de los ciudadanos un nuevo ejemplo de la desesperada violencia con la que pretende in tilmente doblegar la voluntad democr tica de la sociedad espa ola

5016249 its better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal
5016250 while 85 percent of all intra sadc trade is duty free in 2008 we must acknowledge that the work is not yet complete
5016251 the remaining 15 percent of trade is still to be liberalised by 2012 and we need to ensure that all members are able jointly to meet that milestone
5016252 certainly the economic partnership deals will have a profound and even limiting impact on the process of deepening integration at the regional level
5016253 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5016254 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
5016255 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

5016257 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
5016258 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
5016259 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
5016260 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
5016261 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
5016262 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
5016263 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
5016264 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
5016265 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
5016266 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
5016267 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
5016268 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
5016269 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
5016270 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
5016271 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
5016272 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
5016273 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
5016274 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
5016275 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
5016276 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
5016277 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
5016278 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
5016279 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
5016280 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
5016281 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
5016282 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
5016283 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
5016284 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
5016285 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
5016286 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
5016287 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
5016288 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
5016289 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
5016290 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
5016291 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
5016292 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
5016293 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
5016294 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
5016295 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5016296 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
5016297 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5016298 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5016299 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5016300 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5016301 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5016302 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5016303 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5016304 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5016305 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5016306 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5016307 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5016308 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5016309 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5016310 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5016311 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5016312 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5016313 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5016314 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5016315 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5016316 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5016317 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5016318 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5016319 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5016320 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
5016321 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5016322 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5016323 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5016324 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5016325 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5016326 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5016327 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5016328 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5016329 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5016330 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5016331 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5016332 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5016333 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5016334 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5016335 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5016336 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5016337 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5016338 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5016339 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5016340 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5016341 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5016342 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5016343 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5016344 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5016345 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5016346 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5016347 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5016348 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5016349 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5016350 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5016351 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks

5016355 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
5016356 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care

5016370 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5016371 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5016372 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5016373 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5016374 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word

5016445 by growing new trees youre taking carbon out of the air and youre putting it into the wood and sequestering it there

5016493 el clamor ciudadano es que nos pongamos manos a la obra y nos dejemos de dimes y diretes para empezar a hacer cada uno lo que nos compete para enfrentar al crimen
5016494 esto ocurre porque seguramente nos fallan las leyes y tenemos que perfeccionarlas pero tambi n fallan las autoridades ejecutivas en todos los rdenes de gobierno para poner ante los jueces a los responsables de los delitos
5016495 todos los poderes incluyendo al judicial al ejecutivo y legislativo tenemos que hacer mucho para mejorar nuestro trabajo

5016497 es el 99 por ciento de los delitos que no son castigados de los 12 millones de delitos que se cometen anualmente s lo el uno por ciento es castigado esto quiere decir que son 120 mil las denuncias que llegan a un juzgador

5016508 if mr swan thinks fuelwatch will save motorists 10 a tank hes deluding himself and misleading the australian people
5016509 all of the evidence is that fuelwatch will reduce competition and our most price sensitive motorists will end up paying more for their petrol
5016510 if mr swan cant get his sums right on this how can we have any confidence in his management of our 1 trillion economy

5016624 we want to be fair with betis as the first option next week it will be defined between betis or roma
5016625 even though roma will play the champions league and they mean a lot we also have to consider what they are going to offer whether nery will be a key player for them or not
5016626 the decision depends on ourselves we must be careful it is not a matter of money

5016638 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight
5016639 people were concerned about the downturn in the u s but we were saying its not just the u s
5016640 its everywhere its europe its australia its asia japan contracted and china is slowing their growth rate may still be over eight per cent next year too but they are such a highly leveraged economy in terms of the need to pump out tons of stuff to feed people and a slowdown from 10 to eight or nine for them is catastrophic
5016641 all i was trying to say to people before was its not true that demand is driving commodity prices and the dollar right now
5016642 people didnt want to believe that because it meant that parabolic spikes could continue indefinitely prices could go to the sky and all that
5016643 the fact of the matter was that its a typical scenario just like in the tech run when you had big gains attracting big dollars people chasing and then you have the self fulfilling momentum of things going up because people are getting long just because
5016644 you have the whole strengthening u s currency which takes money away from commodities and youve got demand destruction because of the slowdown in the overall economies
5016645 and it will come its just dont be too quick in there because youre going to lose your shirt

5016670 my initial thoughts are that the touch pro is an extremely nice device the screen seems to be more sensitive than the touch diamond and it looks like htc have spent the extra time with the pro refining a few things the touchflo3d interface seems more fluid and that qwerty keyboard it great its a little bit bigger than i had anticipated and looks almost twice as thick as the diamond plus the additional 50 grams may not sound like a lot but make it close to 50 heavier also that tv out feature that everyone has been talking about requires a special cable that you have to buy separately

5016675 i think it has to be confronted it has to be confronted squarely and one of the things that i strongly believe is that you know we are not going to as individuals erase evil from the world that is gods task but we can be soldiers in that process and we can confront it when we see it
5016676 the one thing that i think is very important is for us to have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil but you know a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil
5016677 just because we think our intentions are good doesnt always mean that were going to be doing good

5016708 they are the world champions and theres no way they will be excited about contemplating another loss
5016709 weve had a bit of that scenario but having said that its an opportunity for us and weve got to make the most of it
5016710 without a doubt the springboks wont want to suffer again at home and they are playing at one of their favourite destinations

5016716 whenever you play sydney in sydney its a tough game
5016717 theres no easy games in this league and anyone on the day can steal it weve only lost once to sydney so weve got a good record it will be good to get them at telstra dome
5016718 we probably had four gilt edged chances and didnt put them away
5016719 you can always lose the other team only need one chance and they hit the post and victory goalkeeper michael theoklitos had one good save to make you weigh it up and overwhelmingly we had the better chances
5016720 we took the pressure off them in the second half we should have kept our foot on the accelerator and should have made more use of the possession we had all round we played good football end to end and were disappointed we didnt take all three points but to come to sydney and feel disappointed is a good sign
5016721 ive got a smile on my face and im just really happy with the squad and the coaching
5016722 ive got a hell of a lot to learn after this match and hopefully we can take that into the next game against wellington
5016723 we can be negative about how we didnt get the points but weve got to remain positive with the amount of chances we created

5016725 the conditions were especially difficult today but my bike was well prepared and stuck to the track well
5016726 i posted the best time at the start of the session after that the conditions got worse and i didnt want to take any risks
5016727 it was nothing im happy with my result in pretty difficult conditions
5016728 i am not thinking of leaving my commitment with the club the fans and the players is so big that just because i can be disappointed about different things i wont stop trying my best to achieve all of the targets that we have established as a team
5016729 torres is a key player and he can change games
5016730 with strikers you talk about goals but he was working really hard against their centre backs it is important for the team to have this type of player
5016731 i dont think we were sharp enough to finish what we created
5016732 i also believe that with everyone fit we can create more clear cut chances
5016733 i am confident in us i know we are not making headlines with big names but it is what we produce on the pitch which is important
5016734 i wouldnt call it a eureka moment but there was a sense that this is where we are headed and this is what we are trying to articulate and they have already done a lot of the work
5016735 and quite frankly from a crass political point of view we were in the making friends business the weekly standard represented a part of the primary electorate that we could get
5016736 these networks are well embedded in some of these countries
5016737 were going to have to prove to them that we are very serious and the price that they will pay will not only be for punishment but also deterrence
5016738 i think hes been a victim of a board thats come in given him a lot of money and wanted success immediately
5016739 he spent the money and unfortunately what he spent it on didnt bear fruit thats not his fault it was just bad luck with injuries i think hes got to be judged on what happens from now
5016740 hes done a lot of fitness work but hes still behind all the others

5016797 patients do follow physician recommendations to exercise when instructed to and patients who follow exercise recommendations tend to have lower systolic blood pressures than those who do not
5016798 non pharmacological methods such as exercising are important in improving blood pressure control on a population level as this study looked at the cross section of the u s population
5016799 that would result in an annual reduction of stroke coronary heart disease and all cause mortality by 6 percent 4 percent and 3 percent respectively
5016800 it is thus appropriate to recommend exercise as most patients will follow their physician recommendations and this is associated with improved blood pressure control and likely a reduction in the morbidity and mortality associated with uncontrolled blood pressure
5016801 despite clinical trial evidence and national guideline recommendations for exercise counseling to be provided for patients with high blood pressure this study demonstrates that only one third of these eligible patients received exercise counseling

5016827 between them theyve put out something like a hundred books and in all those years of chatter all those forests laid to waste neither of them has been able to come up with one lifelike woman character
5016828 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
5016829 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive
5016830 maybe i can get you on charlies show you and one of the patriarchs

5016832 i have tried to be careful never to say the risen book was irrelevant ive said it was a factor in reopening the discussion
5016833 for information about the rally or what else you can do to fight the genocide see with african union peacekeepers scheduled to leave darfur at the end of this month and the sudanese government mounting a military campaign against helpless and starving darfurians the horrific situation there may very well turn even worse for hundreds of thousands of people

5016846 one of humanitys greatest conquests has been precisely the overcoming of racism
5016847 overcome any temptation to resort to racism intolerance and exclusion
5016848 events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
5016849 you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5016850 the afghans did not go to canada to kill the canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghan to please the fascist regime of america
5016851 the canadian people have to realize if their sisters their brothers and their children are being killed in afghanistan it is because of the wrong policy of the government of canada and their falling under the influence of others when they sent occupation soldiers to afghanistan
5016852 canadians are working under the policy of america it is a big mistake
5016853 we think cap and trade is an important way to go
5016854 it fits in better with what other jurisdictions are doing and it guarantees emission reductions
5016855 this is an exploration of an area of emissions trading that could be included in a future program for us
5016856 if farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers in a better way and reduce those emissions that come off their field then were further ahead in terms of the total amount of greenhouse gases that are getting released from human operations
5016857 instead of opening up the soil by tilling it really actively where you get a lot of carbon released and get nitrous oxide released during that process if you keep it closed it keeps the carbon sequestered in the soil
5016858 by growing new trees youre taking carbon out of the air and youre putting it into the wood and sequestering it there
5016859 on a national scale we are 10 per cent of the problem with greenhouse gas emissions but we can be 20 per cent of the solution
5016860 and the pilots that are being identified here in ontario are also things that can be used at the national scale
5016861 society has to recognize farmers are willing to do this but we cant do it were not paid to assist
5016862 this is not a widespread please come on down and sign up routine yet
5016863 as im kind of six songs deep im kind of like oh ok
5016864 now that this sort of has this pattern or this trend ive written in and ive touched on 50s 60s 70s i thought ok lets see what we can come up with that has an 80s flair to it
5016865 i really wanted to be a part of it but i also knew that i really needed to focus
5016866 i had to make a choice because i wanted to make sure that all of my attention would be put towards one thing
5016867 i know that i need a certain amount of attention as an artist its like you got to know what your worth is you know
5016868 she looked into my eyes and she said as long as your intent is pure you will not be denied and thats something that has stayed with me forever
5016869 she was like an angel that was sent from the creative forces of the universe to say hey girl dont give up
5016870 i am going to get some advice but i think i might wade in here to set some of the record straight with the media
5016871 we are being crucified on why the taser usage and our members actions at the preliminary stages
5016872 just watched the taser video on bbc tv in australia
5016873 and we hope that when more of the facts are made public it will present a clearer picture of truly what happened
5016874 sgt pierre lemaitre should be fired for purposely misrepresenting the facts and suppressing the video on a false premise
5016875 it appears you have been caught in an outright lie
5016876 in the world of communications police have often been criticized for not giving details and or information regarding an incident resulting in allegations that we are hiding something
5016877 as for myself as a spokesperson in the future i will consider saying that we have no comment theres an ongoing investigation and weather the storm of media criticism that we are not forthcoming
5016878 we have to ensure that we have an open relationship with the media because we rely on the media to get the message out to the public
5016879 so how are you going to lie your way out of this one
5016880 when will charges of manslaughter be brought against the officers
5016881 seeing as there will be no proper action taken against the criminals i should hope a similar fate befalls their families
5016882 after the millions of good things that we have done it was very disheartening to see that level of backlash and anger from the public
5016883 i see on the news eight people have died in five years thats about 1 5 a year how many would have died if we didnt have the taser
5016884 of those eight how many had pre existing conditions that likely contributed if not were the cause of death
5016885 stand by for the autopsy results we might be in for a surprise like tasers didnt kill this guy pre existing medical conditions and or drugs in the system wait and see
5016886 in an unprecedented action and in contradiction to his request of the prior week
5016887 this left no legal basis for the videotape to be held
5016888 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data

5016899 mr vice president we can do now what we didnt do then
5016900 by one of those amazing and fortunate coincidences of history it was just at that time that david wymans book was gaining nationwide public attention
5016901 there were feature stories about it in the newspapers and he was on radio and television shows it seemed like everyone was talking about wymans book it was must reading and i read it the powerful impact that the abandonment of the jews had on me became a major reason that i took a special interest in the plight of the ethiopian jews
5016902 i spoke to the vice president and his top aides
5016903 i gave them a copy of the book and i told them that this was a chance to write a very different history than the history of americas response to the holocaust
5016904 but sudan would not be able to say no to the united states if our government insisted
5016905 i remember how the plane was so crowded that we all had to sit on the floor i was too young to know whether the soldiers taking us were israelis or americans all i knew was that i would finally get to see my mother and brothers and sisters again
5016906 confirmed that his staff members had read abandonment and discussed it with him and that was a major influence in his decision to order the airlift

5016934 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5016935 this is a planning took where all things are going
5016936 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5016937 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5016938 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5016939 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5016940 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5016941 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5016942 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5016943 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5016944 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5016945 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5016946 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5016947 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5016948 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5016949 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5016950 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5016951 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5016952 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5016953 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5016954 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5016955 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5016956 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5016957 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5016958 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5016959 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5016960 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5016961 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5016962 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5016963 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5016964 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5016965 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5016966 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5016967 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5016968 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5016969 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5016970 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5016971 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5016972 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5016973 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5016974 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5016975 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5016976 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5016977 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5016978 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5016979 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5016980 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5016981 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5016982 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5016983 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5016984 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5016985 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5016986 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5016987 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5016988 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5016989 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5016990 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5016991 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5016992 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5016993 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5016994 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5016995 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5016996 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5016997 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5016998 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5016999 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5017000 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5017001 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5017002 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5017003 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5017004 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5017005 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5017006 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5017007 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5017008 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5017009 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5017010 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5017011 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5017012 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5017013 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

5017018 i need to emphasize that what we have done is only in mice we dont know what the implications are for humans but it does raise a red flag that this is something that should be considered

5017020 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5017021 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5017022 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5017023 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5017024 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5017025 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5017026 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5017027 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5017028 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5017029 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5017030 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5017031 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5017032 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5017033 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5017034 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5017035 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5017036 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5017037 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5017038 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5017039 like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay is the man who gains riches by unjust means when his life is half gone they will desert him and in the end he will prove to be a fool
5017040 so i say to you ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you for everyone who asks receives he who seeks finds and to him who knocks the door will be opened which of you fathers if your son asks for a fish will give him a snake instead
5017041 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5017042 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5017043 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5017044 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5017045 the party legislators meet decided to withdraw support to the government after legislators meet the central committee meeting endorsed the decision
5017046 we will request governor syed sibte razi to initiate the process to form the next government in the state
5017047 if the upa does not come out in support of the jmm our options are open to go to others
5017048 irans omid hope satellite was launched on sunday using the safir ambassador satellite carrier rocket
5017049 the president attended irans space centre and ordered the launch he congratulated the iranian nation on the great achievement
5017050 i mean who even uses the phrase make love anymore
5017051 huh well i do what else are you gonna call it
5017052 it is best to trim a babys nails while they are sleeping
5017053 the whole thing every race one after the other from winning by one hundredth of a second to finishing if off with a world record its an amazing experience
5017054 still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so fucking smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what fuck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
5017055 it seems unlikely that flash 10 will be able to do any sort of uploading of any kind
5017056 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them
5017057 i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
5017058 they are doing well but they still need a lot of care
5017059 what they need most is a dwelling to live in i hope the government will give them an apartment
5017060 weve come to a mutual conclusion on what we shall present to the leaders of the coalition government

5017065 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of the constitution

5017071 in an era of such great swimmers i think watching phelps win eight gold medals has been my highlight
5017072 i just dont think there is a perspective for him
5017073 hes beyond everything we know in athens when he was going for eight golds i said it would never happen not in this day and age with semifinal swims and the competition level phelps has taken every expectation and broken it he seems to be the only guy who sees the impossible as possible and thats what makes him the best once he crosses the threshold other people are able to foresee it happening if he can do it we can do it but hes always one step ahead of us
5017074 i thought he would win six or seven but with a little bit of luck hed probably get eight
5017075 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5017076 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance

5017085 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
5017086 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race

5017236 mr yang did not continue with his course and left without an award
5017237 we can confirm new evidence has been provided about zhen xing yang
5017238 it suggests he may have gained entry to his ma degree course at newcastle university as a result of producing fraudulent documentation stating he had successfully completed an undergraduate degree
5017239 officers are continuing to work with newcastle university to establish if this information is correct

5017253 a liberal government will give tough justice to the people who deserve it but try to help people that can be helped
5017254 this 40 million 80 bed young offender prison will not be for violent offenders but for those offenders that do not pose a risk to the public
5017255 it will mean these offenders will not have to mix with harder criminals and be corrupted it will free up beds in medium to maximum security prisons
5017256 there will also be a focus on helping offenders better prepare themselves for release and successful resettlement into the community
5017257 labors solution to the prison overcrowding crisis is to retain weak sentencing laws that release prisoners back into society before they are fully rehabilitated putting the community at risk
5017258 a liberal government will deliver tough laws and imprison offenders who break those laws

5017261 any of that permanent water entitlement theyre buying back is unlikely to be able to deliver for quite a long time
5017262 there is enough water in the system just to get a coverage of water on the lakes to minimise the risk of acidification
5017263 there is enough water within the menindee system and you could probably buy enough further upstream if they went into the temporary market
5017264 the murray darling basin commission advises that the existing strategy to protect lake albert from acidification by pumping water from lake alexandrina is proving effective we are expecting further advice on next steps over coming weeks from the commission
5017265 coag has the promise of fixing it in the longer term but if we let it go this summer then we are going on an irreversible pathway
5017266 decisions we make in the next few months we cant go back on so if we let the sea water in or it goes acid sulphate they will have implications for the next generation
5017267 last year on the temporary market there was 220gl traded so you start to think 100gl is not that way out there
5017268 if you go from fresh water to salt water in a few months then the ecosystem is going to go into shock if you can shandy that water then it wont be quite so bad
5017269 they were quite receptive if someone could put 500 ml on the table to thinking about selling their water on a temporary basis that is a damn sight better than they will get for cotton
5017270 if that had gone through the system the lower murray wouldnt be in the state it is in now
5017271 but we have to appreciate the consequences so we have to look at what role can the north play now

5017286 he never had any criminal record he never smoked he drank occasionally weve done our best to raise him and it paid off he was a very good son
5017287 hes obviously walked into something person or persons and a savage and brutal and cowardly attack occurred just at the intersection of kidman street near brook street
5017288 he was basically left in a grave condition on the footpath
5017289 he was a great son and hopefully he will remain one
5017290 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
5017291 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5017292 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5017293 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu
5017294 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5017295 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5017296 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5017297 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship
5017298 apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5017299 by now lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
5017300 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house
5017301 the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5017302 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha
5017303 every time she sees a picture of them together it kills her

5017309 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5017310 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5017311 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5017312 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5017313 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5017325 the canadian people have to realize if their sisters their brothers and their children are being killed in afghanistan it is because of the wrong policy of the government of canada and their falling under the influence of others when they sent occupation soldiers to afghanistan
5017326 therefore you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5017327 we just want those in russia who seem to be willing to look to the future people perhaps like president dmitry medvedev to perhaps begin to exercise more influence here and get some of these peoples rhetoric under control
5017328 we have agreed along with our partners in poland and the to give the russians access both physical and technical access so they know whats going on every step of the way
5017329 weve agreed not to even make the interceptors operational until the iranians have test launched a missile that has the range to hit much of not to mention russia so this is really an old song that theyre singing and it really just doesnt play

5017369 the students will just learn there is a theory called evolution defended by darwin back in the 19th century
5017370 however views of islamic thinkers from the middle ages about evolution and creation have been included
5017371 science is hardly an issue in turkey therefore evolution could hardly have been an issue
5017372 it looked like marx and darwin were together two long bearded guys spreading ideas that make people lose their faith
5017373 the root of the terrorism that plagues our planet is not any of the divine religions but atheism and the expression of atheism in our times is darwinism and materialism
5017374 its very well done with magnificent photos a very stylish tool of creationist propaganda
5017375 harun yahya has managed to create a media based and popular form of creationism
5017376 if its wrong to say darwins theory should not be in the books because it is in line with atheist propaganda we cant disregard intelligent design because it coincides with beliefs of monotheistic religions about creation

5017458 i thought he was attractive and i liked his eyes
5017459 people think of love as a feeling but feelings come and go
5017460 when you approach love as a commitment then you achieve permanence i reached a point when i realized this is a relationship i wanted to last
5017461 i remain very hopeful that voters in this state will understand that love and commitment fairness and equality are values important regardless of sexual orientation
5017462 were neighbors were friends and were co workers people know us and it would be awfully hard for folks to say we shouldnt have the right to love and have a commitment

5017484 my feelings for ellen overrode all of my fear about being out as a lesbian
5017485 that had never happened to me in my life where i saw somebody and experienced all of those things you hear about in songs and read about in poetry my knees were weak

5017495 he wanted to do something personally to get children away from the life of violence he had a heart and passion thats why as the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
5017496 ive been able to come back into my daughters life and that was an adjustment anyway because im an alcoholic and its the first time weve really been able to share

5017550 i think hes absolutely right i mean i think its a very brave thing to do and it will have a huge influence that he has said it ive had a number of meetings with black church leaders who make the same point they are concerned about family breakdown and social breakdown and want to see what i call a responsibility revolution take place

5017563 here i have to reveal a trade secret which punctures the mystique of intelligence analysis generally speaking 80 of the information one needs to form judgments on key intelligence targets or issues is available in open media
5017564 in his usual form former un weapons inspector scott ritter told a packed crowd to stop whining about corporate media and become their own intelligence operatives we the people have the same resources and tools that intelligence networks rely heavily on its called google as our own intelligence operatives we cant allow cnn fox nbc and abc to edit and cherry pick information but ask questions and find the answers ourselves
5017565 many apparently separate developing daily events dont make the slightest sense if you dont look at them in their strategic context in the face of orwellian control of the media it is even more necessary to judge contemporary developments with the eye of an historian who has not forgotten the lessons of history

5017586 the idea to trigger the blasts in various parts of the country including ahmedabad was conceived in a terrorist training camp in kerala where safdar nagori and his brother kamaruddin nagori delivered instigating speeches
5017587 bashir and a computer expert from mumbai are the masterminds of the blasts
5017588 we had got human intelligence about the increasing activities at the residence of zahid shaikh in juhapura area of ahmedabad for the past several months following which zahid was detained and during interrogation he spilled the beans on the other perpetrators of the terror act
5017589 mufti abu bashir had purchased five sim cards on the name of five local people and he had kept it with himself during his stay in ahmedabad and the numbers went silent after july 26
5017590 in fact he abu bashir was in ahmedabad when the blasts were carried out
5017591 it was a joint operation of a number of agencies like the dcb gujarat ats central intelligence rajasthan police hyderabad police uttar pradesh police maharashtra police and delhi police
5017592 we have certain leads which suggest that the other bomb blasts may also be detected though we cannot give more details on it as the investigations are on
5017593 from here we started linking a long chain that ran through several cities and states and involved several people we pieced together the information and clues and things fell into place leads to the blasts at lumbini park and gokul chat may also come out of the interrogation in a couple of days
5017594 raziuddin had provided clues on simis activities its links with tamil nadu based al umma to both karnataka and hyderabad police he had also met safdar nagori late last year when nagori made a secret visit to hyderabad and resided in saidabad area where he discussed simis plans and views he had also distributed jehadi pamphlets and cds
5017595 he consistently produces money from subcontractors and other people who work for him

5017598 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
5017599 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

5017630 mike and i were battling back and forth on the bike and were even running alongside each other pushing our bikes uphill at one point we traded leads all the way to the summit and i know what a great runner he is so i went flat out on the downhill i was basically free falling down the side of this mountain
5017631 it was a battle out there and i was glad to catch up to him on the climbs but every time the trail flatted out he took off and was just gone
5017632 it was a good race for me and pretty exciting to duke it out with conrad that doesnt happen very often
5017633 its nice to be at the top of the mountain
5017634 this was a very important race for me as im trying to win my sixth pro series title and after the dnf in richmond i needed the points here ive had quite a few flats this year and flatted at this race the last two years so i made sure to use some extra strong tires brought two cans of air and a couple spare tires i wasnt taking any chances
5017635 to me this is the hardest race of the whole season because of the altitude and the climbing but the ambiance here is really special with all of the community support and great facilities i really enjoy this place
5017636 i probably would have gone a minute slower on that run if it werent for seth he was on my heel the whole time
5017637 coming into this race i thought there were four other guys that could win and they all finished in front of me
5017638 ogden is the best the community is so friendly and its so scenic up here but this course is as physical as they get i mean you even have to pedal the downhills its a really difficult challenge and tests your fitness but at the same time its gorgeous and really fun riding
5017639 i have an overwhelming sense of relief so many things can go wrong out here and when it all works out like this its a great feeling
5017640 i could see her up ahead but i just couldnt catch her
5017641 the fundamental principle behind any sampling activity is that a small amount of collected material should be representative of all the material being monitored the number and location of samples that are needed to make up a representative sample depends on how homogeneous the material is if it is very homogeneous only a few samples may be required if the material is heterogeneous many more samples will be required
5017642 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view

5017644 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5017645 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5017646 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states

5017648 i want you to know who is to blame for this conflict and thats mr saakashvili who started this war and who is an aggressor 2000 people were killed in one day

5017748 we just wanted to play as well as we can we wanted to start all guns blazing
5017749 last year we had a difficult start and the football we played in the first half today was top drawer
5017750 we can build on that the first half was as good as we can play
5017751 having not won anything last year we go in to this season with a real determination and i think we showed that
5017752 its not easy to come to a different country and settle in as quickly as he has his touch is fantastic and hes obviously going to be a great signing for us
5017753 i feel good it was a great game to start with a win is the important thing
5017754 russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody
5017755 im not quite sure why this deputy chief of staff felt compelled to make those kinds of threats
5017756 we just want those in russia who seem to be willing to look to the future people perhaps like president dmitry medvedev to perhaps begin to exercise more influence here and get some of these peoples rhetoric under control
5017757 we have agreed along with our partners in poland and the czech republic to give the russians access both physical and technical access so they know whats going on every step of the way
5017758 weve agreed not to even make the interceptors operational until the iranians have test launched a missile that has the range to hit much of western europe not to mention russia so this is really an old song that theyre singing and it really just doesnt play
5017759 understanding your audience is critical potential sponsors will want to know to whom you are reaching and how it will effect there bottom line quite simply the very undertaking of sponsorship is an irrational proposition for new artist but they must embrace rather than resist with persistence and enthusiasm because emotion often sell their product and that emotion starts with the artist who fans admire and will follow their lead

5017761 i had faith that this eventually would happen its an incredible emotional experience to see two men i know and love finally get married
5017762 im really happy for them that theyre able to seal a union thats been long and wonderful they really love each other
5017763 i thought he was attractive and i liked his eyes
5017764 people think of love as a feeling but feelings come and go
5017765 when you approach love as a commitment then you achieve permanence i reached a point when i realized this is a relationship i wanted to last
5017766 i remain very hopeful that voters in this state will understand that love and commitment fairness and equality are values important regardless of sexual orientation
5017767 were neighbors were friends and were co workers people know us and it would be awfully hard for folks to say we shouldnt have the right to love and have a commitment
5017768 the constitution cant legislate behavior thats not the purpose of the constitution
5017769 i hate the song it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray katy is our daughter and we love her but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself at the moment we cannot cut her out of our lives as she is our child but she knows we disagree strongly with what she is doing and the message she is promoting regarding homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin
5017770 excuse me do you mind if i plug this in so we can both have power thanks
5017771 our job at antiwar com is to examine the candidates positions through the lens of anti interventionism subjecting them to the most thorough scrutiny yes we have our opinions but our institutional role is primarily informative we dont endorse candidates we just seek to help our readers answer the most important question of the day will we be a global empire or a free people again alas no candidate will be our salvation there is no messiah on the ballot who will lead us directly to the promised land of peace and nonintervention but this particular election is nonetheless important and its essential for an independent principled organization to hold the candidates feet to the fire that organization is antiwar com
5017772 it is not sexism we really didnt think we need to hold her feet to the fire she is pretty perfect on foreign policy
5017773 any time you portray four men as the presidential candidates and two of them from minority parties and not picture the female candidate thats sexism
5017774 the reason cynthia mckinney is not pictured is because we feel she is pretty perfect on foreign policy
5017775 one problem is that there are so many people running this year and i wasnt even sure we should have pictured barr and nader but i let the editorial director make the decision it may have been a mistake i really dont think it was sexism or racism i am a big fan of mckinney it is unfortunate that she is not getting more coverage and we may be playing into the thinking that has caused this problem that page is now history but i will consider writing an apology on the blog thank you for pointing out my faulty thinking
5017776 thank you for taking the time to respond and to consider my comments i would appreciate if you would also forward this response to your colleagues if you put up a website and the picture is of four men two major two minor who are presidential candidates and you exclude a woman of color who is seen by anti war activists as a candidate with exciting ideas that is making women and women of color invisible in an important visual way people respond more to the visual than the written in this day and age it sounds like you are saying please correct me if im wrong that you dont think it was sexism or racism because you admire ms mckinney and i hear that it was not you individually who made that decision i think we all must understand that sexism and racism happens daily its a daily fact of life for women and people of color its not unusual for any of us to make a woman or a person of color invisible is business as usual given the level of indoctrination we all have received about the privilege and importance of men and white people for example i was shocked when some progressives did not immediately acknowledge the disgusting sexism directed against senator clinton and the vile racism directed against senator obama the intention of white people and men is really not the important issue the effect of actions on people of color and women is id like to see you and the staff acknowledge that on the web and perhaps post and run some analysis

5017783 this goes hand in hand with my goal of changing swimming
5017784 i think its probably one of the greatest things sport in general has ever seen
5017785 the shame of it is other athletes arent going to realize how hard it is the world is fast in swimming right now the world was not fast when mark spitz did his seven
5017786 when you come out and swim fast times people realize that it can be done
5017787 you set that bar a bit high and people are going to come with you
5017788 im going to concentrate on the 5 im not going to cry
5017789 we have a few regrets because we had several occasions in the first half to increase the lead
5017790 we were a bit in trouble in the second half we loosened a bit our hold on the midfield and they nantes regained some self confidence
5017791 when i went to the all star game every hitter came up to me and said the only question i want to ask is whats with the glove thing
5017792 i tell people i do it to fan myself because im a sweater and i get hot out there
5017793 geovanni spent all week practicing to shoot with his right foot and he sticks one in the bean bag with his left i cant believe man city let him go for nothing
5017794 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5017795 it was like starting all over again i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years but thats a good thing
5017796 i felt like i threw the ball well moved around ok
5017797 ive been throwing the ball well i just feel like once i get the timing down with these guys ill be ok
5017798 there were a lot of things to appreciate in the performance tonight in that we didnt just pack it in and say lets go home
5017799 it was a little weird but for the most part i felt comfortable in this uniform
5017800 i feel comfortable in this locker room i had numerous people on the redskins team say man it almost dont look right but its got to start looking right
5017801 we all wanted to see him in a different uniform a new place and to see how he reacted
5017802 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5017803 it was a perfect rally except that this morning i was not fully concentrated and stalled the car twice

5017810 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5017811 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5017812 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5017813 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5017814 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states

5017840 what a mistake worst thing we ever did it was because of my own insecurity when i saw all these other independent record companies going out of existence we were sort of done in by the broker who was supposed to be representing us he undersold us

5017846 he stuck his neck way out for what was happening in austin
5017847 but he gave us his personal copy his generosity in just giving me the tapes when we had strung him along when he was sticking his neck out for us was just a boon i really didnt have words to thank him

5017850 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5017851 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5017852 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5017853 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato

5017918 a sudden and drastic reduction in the availability of credit
5017919 lower energy prices if sustained should begin to help cool inflation fears inflation lags economic growth by several quarters and the economy continues to slow inflation fears should gradually recede

5017921 tomorrow is going to be wonderful because tonight i do not understand anything
5017922 very frankly i cant come to a firm conclusion as to whether were dealing with a bull or a bear market sometimes you just have to wait and allow the market to tell its story remember we may be in a hurry but the market never is
5017923 global businesses are very nervous they are more upbeat than they were in the spring but confidence is low and is fragile
5017924 tax rebate dollars supported economic growth in the us in the second quarter by the next fomc meeting on september 16 the fomc will have another months data for inflation employment and retail sales employment and retail sales should continue to show weakness and headline inflation will likely be considerably lower therefore the fed is firmly on hold
5017925 the fundamental picture for the dollar has improved substantially in recent weeks
5017926 this commodities sell off which began in july and has continued into august also corresponds to the long term seasonal cycle in which prices for many commodities tend to bottom out in late summer before rebounding in the fall
5017927 a global recession is widely expected by fund managers as the credit crunch marks its first anniversary by mutating from a financial crisis into a world economic downturn according to merrill lynch
5017928 almost one quarter of the fund managers questioned by merrill in august for its monthly survey said the global economy was already in recession and almost half expect the world economy to contract over the next 12 months
5017929 however inflation fears are fading after the recent fall in oil prices
5017930 in an extraordinary reversal a net 18 of the surveys respondents said they expected global core inflation to fall over the next 12 months two months ago a net 33 thought inflation would rise
5017931 fears about stagflation are starting to give way to fears that the global economy is in for a period of below trend growth and below trend inflation said david bowers of absolute strategy research and independent consultant to merrills fund managers surveys
5017932 mr bowers said it was crystal clear that fund managers did not believe analysts profit forecasts with a net 83 describing earnings estimates for the coming year as too high
5017933 but as the economic downturn spreads to europe and japan enthusiasm for us assets has been rediscovered by fund managers with 53 expecting the dollar to appreciate and 38 planning to overweight us equities over the next twelve months both readings are record highs
5017934 the fall in oil prices has prompted a partial unwinding of the highly popular long energy short financials trade
5017935 among european fund managers the net overweight position in the oil and gas sector has fallen sharply from 62 in june to 11 in august meanwhile the net underweight in banks has shrunk from 62 in june to 40
5017936 it would be a serious mistake for the international community to regard the dramatic escalation of violence in georgia as just another flare up in the caucasus
5017937 the names of the flashpoints may be unfamiliar the territory remote and the dispute parochial but the battle under way will have important repercussions beyond the region
5017938 the outcome of the struggle will determine the course of russias relations with its neighbours will shape dmitri medvedevs presidency could alter the relationship between the kremlin and the west and crucially could decide the fate of caspian basin energy supplies
5017939 it was known that a serious confrontation had been building up british intelligence predicted this year that a war in the caucasus was probable the focus was georgia the wests main ally in the region and the only export route for caspian oil and gas outside kremlin control
5017940 part of the responsibility must lie with president saakashvili the us educated geogian leader has rightly been praised for turning around his countrys dire economy transforming the soviet style army into a modern western force and standing up to the kremlin
5017941 on paper the small georgian military is no match for the might of russia but mr saakashvili has calculated that his friends in the west notably america and britain will protect him
5017942 russia has made clear in word and deed that it will do anything to prevent natos expansion on its western and southern flanks
5017943 america and britain are closely involved in providing military assistance to the georgians in the form of arms and training the support is aimed at encouraging the rise of georgia as an independent sovereign state
5017944 but the help is also partly a means of protecting the oil pipeline across georgia that carries crude from the caspian to the black sea the only export route that bypasses russias stranglehold on energy exports from the region
5017945 in short washington has responded to this financial crisis with a politically driven reactive approach policy initiatives have been framed more by the circumstances of the moment than by a strategic assessment of what it truly takes to put the us economy back on a more sustainable path
5017946 by perpetuating excess consumption low saving unrealistic goals of home ownership and moral hazards in financial markets this patchwork approach has the biggest flaw of all it does little to change bad behavior
5017947 if this crisis is anything it is a wake up call
5017948 the longer the united states sustained the unsustainable the more it believed in the perpetuity of its charmed existence
5017949 more than anything america now needs tough love a new course that owns up to years of excess and the remedies those excesses now require it is the broad outlines of what that new approach might entail more saving as well as more investment in both people and infrastructure an energy policy might be nice as well as would be more prudent stewardship of the financial system this program wont win any popularity contests but in the end it is americas only hope for a sustainable post bubble prosperity
5017950 the fed has lowered the federal funds rate 325 basis points since september and set up various programs to support fragile financial markets according to the senior loan officer opinion survey despite these endeavors the credit crunch remains in place for the most part
5017951 the details of the survey show that the housing market which was the trigger for the current financial market crisis is unlikely to stage a rebound in the near term
5017952 on the business side the fraction of banks indicating they had tightened lending standards for small firms hit a new high see chart 6 at 65 3 while the percentage of banks reporting tighter conditions for large firms rose to 57 6 from 55 4 in the april survey
5017953 the survey also included questions about the outlook for credit standards in the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009 the main message from answers to these questions is that a large percentage of banks would be tightening standards in the latter half of 2008 and the fraction of banks indicating they would tighten standards in the first two quarters of 2009 showed a small decline
5017954 the logic of the credit squeeze is inexorable the latest data from banks and prices in the secondary credit market point to a much slower economy
5017955 the federal reserves survey of us banks senior lending officers came out with little fanfare this week
5017956 lending officers said they were continuing to tighten standards whether on credit cards prime mortgages consumer or business loans even though a strong majority of banks had done this in the second quarter that implies a squeeze on consumption and lower investment as the year goes on
5017957 a similar exercise by the european central bank polling lenders in the eurozone seemed a little less gloomy but only on the surface
5017958 with banks planning to lend less and charge more for loans this makes sense it will be harder for companies to avoid default
5017959 the july headline and core inflation numbers were higher than expected however lower energy prices if sustained should begin to help cool inflation fears in addition core inflation will turn lower because the economy remains weak and companies are failing to pass through higher input costs
5017960 we have highlighted several times before that core cpi is likely at a cyclical peak inflation lags economic growth by several quarters and the economy continues to slow
5017961 bottom line hawkish fed rhetoric is unlikely to translate into a change in policy rates for a long time because inflation fears should gradually recede further economic weakness remains the more immediate threat
5017962 the cpis rapid ascent in the past three months undoubtedly remains near the top of the list of concerns of the fomc
5017963 tax rebate dollars supported economic growth in the us in the second quarter by the next fomc meeting on september 16 the fomc will have another months data for inflation employment and retail sales employment and retail sales should continue to show weakness and headline inflation will likely be considerably lower therefore the fed is firmly on hold
5017964 adjusted to pre clinton 1990 methodology annual cpi growth rose to roughly 8 6 in july from 8 3 in june while the sgs alternate consumer inflation measure which reverses gimmicked changes to official cpi reporting methodologies back to 1980 rose to a 28 year high of roughly 13 4 in july up from 12 6 in june real july retail sales declined 0 9 m m and are down 2 47 y y
5017965 weve recently seen the greatest expansion of credit in history
5017966 the us and the economies of the free world run on credit
5017967 with credit being restricted a second and very serious danger surfaces that danger is asset deflation the very thought of asset deflation sends chills of fear up fed chief ben bernankes spine credit contraction asset deflation shades of the great depression
5017968 whats the antidote for deflation its print print print what would golds reaction be to print print print golds reaction would be rise rise rise
5017969 industrial production increased 0 2 in july following a revised 0 4 gain in the prior month these headline readings mask the soft production situation at the nations factories on a year to year basis industrial production dropped 0 2 the first drop in factory production since june 2003 output of utilities fell 1 8 and that of mining mainly related to oil drilling moved up 0 95 the operating rate of the factory sector edged up one notch to 79 9 in july
5017970 it will take a much deeper correction in oil prices some light at the end of the housing tunnel and a stabilization of employment trends to reverse the us consumer retrenchment
5017971 retail sales growth slowed in july led by dismal sales at auto dealers
5017972 the main factor that will determine consumer spending behaviour will be employment growth and we expect hiring trends to continue to deteriorate until at least the end of the year in addition the other major headwinds housing and the banking system are still in place bottom line economic risks are high and we doubt there will be much improvement in the next few quarters
5017973 the trade deficit narrowed to 56 8 billion in june from 59 2 billion in may the decline in the trade gap reflects the faster pace of growth in exports of goods and service 4 0 compared with imports 1 8 all other things constant real gdp growth in the second quarter should be stronger than the 1 9 growth rate reported to account for a narrowing of the trade gap however soft economic data from abroad particularly from europe suggests that an increase in exports is most likely to show muted growth in the months ahead
5017974 the chart below shows the year on year growth rate for us gdp over the past 40 years along with the contribution from net exports in goods and services
5017975 us gdp grew by 1 8 year on year in the second quarter of 2008 yet 1 5 of this growth came from net exports less than a third of a percent came from domestic demand the domestic economy has lost pretty well all momentum so imports have been curbed but us exports have been holding up well thanks to a competitive exchange rate and the strength at least until now of the developing economies the contribution from net exports is just about all that is holding up us growth but this is now likely to give
5017976 delinquency rates on single family mortgages have reached their highest level on record the fed started tracking this statistic in 1991 dragging up the delinquency rate on all loans held by us banks
5017977 these delinquency rates show that the financial system has not emerged from the credit crisis but rather entered a new stage where bad loaning schemes are blowing up in the face of the bankers who created them
5017978 prime mortgages are starting to default at disturbingly high rates a development that threatens to slow any potential housing recovery
5017979 the delinquency rate for prime mortgages worth less than 417 000 was 2 44 in may compared with 1 38 a year earlier according to loanperformance
5017980 delinquencies jumped even more for prime loans of more than 417 000 so called jumbo loans they rose to 4 03 of outstanding loans in may compared with 1 11 a year earlier
5017981 and prime loans issued in 2007 are performing the worst of all failing at a rate nearly triple that of prime loans issued in 2006 according to loanperformance
5017982 the extent of how bad these loans are doing is very troubling said pat newport real estate economist with global insight a forecasting firm
5017983 prime loans are just the latest class of mortgages to suffer a spike in failure rates
5017984 now as prime loans are added to the mix the resulting foreclosures could haunt the housing market for a long time according to global insights patrick newport
5017985 banks losses from the us subprime crisis and the ensuing credit crunch crossed the 500 billion mark as writedowns spread to more asset types
5017986 the writedowns and credit losses at more than 100 of the worlds biggest banks and securities firms rose after ubs reported second quarter earnings today which included 6 billion of charges on subprime related assets
5017987 the international monetary fund in an april report estimated banks losses at 510 billion about half its forecast of 1 trillion for all companies predictions have crept up since then with new york university economist nouriel roubini predicting losses to reach 2 trillion
5017988 us stocks pulled ahead of brazil russia india and china this week for the first time in 2008 spurred by the federal reserves efforts to cut borrowing costs even as the biggest developing countries are raising theirs
5017989 the bombay stock exchanges sensex index dropped 25 in 2008 through yesterday chinas csi 300 index decreased 54 and russias benchmark rts index fell 21 brazils bovespa has lost 15 this year
5017990 in the us where economic growth this year is projected to be less than a third of brazils 4 7 the federal reserve reduced interest rates seven times to 2 in the past year brazils central bank has raised its benchmark 1 75 points to 13 indias climbed 1 25 points to 9 and russias increased 1 point to 11
5017991 the fashionable investment tactic of the past month buying bank stocks while selling energy companies could already have gone too far merrill lynch warned clients yesterday
5017992 in mid july hedge funds pension funds and other institutional investors dramatically reversed their enthusiasm for energy stocks and loathing for financials in an abrupt about turn that sent bank shares soaring and oil and gas companies sinking
5017993 but merrill said yesterday that the unwinding of the classic bet of the credit crunch may already have been overdone giving warning that banks across europe could still be forced to raise between 70 billion and 120 billion in new equity on top of the 120 billion already raised
5017994 merrill said that the rush to buy back into banks may already have gone too far after it stress tested their balance sheets it also said that fears over the sliding energy price were being overplayed
5017995 what will be the likely impact on equity markets if the dominant global themes of the first six months of the year rising commodity prices inflation and interest rate fears and a weakening dollar continue to unravel in the second half
5017996 robert parkes equity strategist at hsbc says there has been a clear reversal in global sector performance between the first half of 2008 and the period from july 1 to date
5017997 the top five performers in the first half oil services industrial metals mining oil producers and chemicals have been the five worst in the second half
5017998 away from the likely path of commodity prices inflation interest rates and the dollar a theme likely to remain prominent is concern about the global growth outlook he says
5017999 it may be too early to get involved in cyclical sectors particularly on the consumer side
5018000 for eurozone companies with dollar exposure the negative impact from the exchange rate on earnings growth is likely to remain prominent in the third quarter before it fades in the fourth quarter and then turns positive as we move into 2009
5018001 for uk companies with dollar exposure the currency is likely to boost earnings growth in each of the next four quarters

5018007 in battle it is shown that the imperial warriors take after the over color of yuriko omega which is implied that the imperial military ranks honor yuriko in some form of a hero despite her grim personality and mysterious background however the over color for yuriko is an unanswered question itself some scratches it off as a fashion for yuriko since after all she is a schoolgirl however intercepted radio waves reveal that the emperor may have a hand in it from what is gathered it seems the emperor has a strong preference for cheese and its color
5018008 the soviet union still has yet to answer why they put so much of their insignia hue on their forces
5018009 the allies and soviets mistakenly mistranslated the imperial warriors rifle as laser when really its a word they keep on seeing next to tankbuster and waveforce plasma the empire of the rising sun adds this to their list of enemy ridicule which is posted on bbc monthly on a contract for supplying the latest in pink plushies for those working in the british media

5018048 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5018049 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5018050 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5018051 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5018053 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil
5018054 just last year the seven states entered into a new implementing agreement and that agreement is working as intended
5018055 it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue

5018067 ich war mit dem auto auf dieser rallye sehr zufrieden
5018068 das war jetzt die zweite veranstaltung in folge auf der wir buchst blich keinerlei probleme hatten und sauber ins ziel kamen die zuverl ssigkeit passt weswegen wir jetzt mehr am speed des autos arbeiten k nnen
5018069 wenn wir die kilometer vergleichen die unser auto im vergleich zu den anderen wrc wagen auf dem buckel hat dann machen wir recht gute fortschritte das war vermutlich die schwierigste aller asphaltrallyes hier mit einem herstellerpunkt zu enden ist also ein gutes ergebnis ich bin jetzt recht optimistisch was die anderen asphalt events in spanien und korsika angeht heute hatte ich jedenfalls viel spa
5018070 wir haben uns nur darauf konzentriert die sache durchzuziehen und ins ziel zu kommen die rallye war in punkto erfahrung sowohl f r mich als auch f r das team sehr wertvoll ich litt allerdings unter meiner unerfahrenheit ich bin bei dieser veranstaltung schon seit 2005 nicht mehr dabei gewesen und war seit januar nicht mehr auf asphalt unterwegs
5018071 bei so einer rallye brauchst du ganz einfach das volle vertrauen um das maximum zu geben sehr schade dass wir gestern einen randstein getroffen und eine antriebswelle zerst rt haben ohne das problem h tten wir sicherlich in den top 10 liegen k nnen die drei tage waren allerdings sehr n tzlich und wir haben jede menge informationen mitnehmen k nnen die sich in der zukunft noch als sehr wichtig erweisen werden
5018072 die hier gezeigte konstanz unterstreicht wie sehr sich die arbeit gelohnt hat das wiederum bringt uns in die starke position in den verbliebenen wm l ufen unseren verbesserungsprozess darauf aufzubauen sowohl auf schotter als auch auf asphalt
5018073 i hope he intends to honor the pledge this time
5018074 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5018075 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5018076 russia will pay a price we will look seriously with our allies and bilaterally at the consequences of this russian action for russian integration
5018077 russia has already paid a price because its strategic objective of undermining the democracy of georgia of destroying its infrastructure is not going to succeed
5018078 oh they made my best friend cry i hate them gt
5018079 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5018080 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5018081 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5018082 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato
5018083 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear
5018084 we are ready to take our career to the next level however we know nothing about the music industry
5018085 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5018086 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5018087 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5018088 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5018089 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5018090 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5018091 this looks frankly to me more like decisions made by the prime minister than by the president
5018092 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5018093 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5018094 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5018095 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5018096 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5018097 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric and probably fairly empty rhetoric
5018098 the truth of the matter is russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody the poles know that we know it
5018099 if the small and big boys of brooklyn find it a pleasure to shout at me i have no objections
5018100 no matter where we play i go through the same ordeal and at the present time i am so used to it that at times i forget to smile at my tormentors
5018101 baseballs league of nations a tribute to native americans in baseball
5018102 for myself its like a breath of fresh air were always doing something that involves pottery or basket making or painting or sculpturing of some kind weve forgotten that baseball was a part of our history as well
5018103 we came up with a lot of cool stuff that we didnt think we were going to find
5018104 it was kind of amazing once we started how much there really was out there how many of these guys that you did find out about you may have never realized before were native
5018105 i wanted to say something i really did i didnt know what to say without it sounding fake so i thought the better option was to not say anything at all
5018106 why should i buy the cow when im getting the milk for free
5018107 easy girls its from those who stood on the outside
5018108 if youre really a ghost how come you have clothes on and how come theyve got a layer of transparency too
5018109 youre right im not a ghost if i were a ghost id be naked and transparent i probably wouldnt be a manifestation of my former self either i dont know what i am
5018110 sud dell isola ce uno strato di roccia insolito e ho scoperto che se lo sottoponevo a una certa temperatura nella mia fornace si scioglieva in un metallo duttile e ho usato quello per fare gli arnesi
5018111 non e un gran che ma io la chiamo casa mia accomodati vuoi bere qualcosa
5018112 questa donna e proprio incredibile e fenomenale chiss che altre sorprese mi aspettano
5018113 ingoia tutto eccitato gli occhi incominciano a riempirsi di lacrime
5018114 every epoch suffers from the disability of being contemporaneous with itself and of having no idea where it might lead
5018115 of form and content become entirely one because the poems language somehow incarnates its meaning whereas language points to things poetic language actually embodies them there is a theology lurking behind this poetics just as the word of god is the father made flesh so the poem does not simply talk about things but in some mysterious way becomes them
5018116 only when words cease to be themselves and merge into their referents can they be truly expressive
5018117 it is as if in the midst of a lively conversation between two friends a maid suddenly appeared to tell the host that a salesman was at the door in the second place i refuse the positions i have taken in the main narrative believing likewise that it is improper of me to dispute things with my visitor in this case the reader in the sala i have thought it best to argue in the backroom in the notes at the end of this book
5018118 what appears in a psychological explanation as fictive threats from within the self turn out to have social and material form the ilustrado ideal of domestic comfort and ease which agoncillo tries to realize in and as scholarly write is potentially disrupted by rude concerns of commerce and petty enterprises represented by the intrusive salesman the narrative which secures the ilustrado subjecthood is conceived as a civilized sala conversation between two friends which mundane economic concerns as well as politically tendentious arguments must be excluded and relegated to the backroom the notes at the end of the book
5018119 psychology is the logic of attachments and sympathetic action which serves as the very methodology of agoncillos history it is not just that agoncillo is prejudiced by prior regional gender and class identification
5018120 the only explanation i have for this conclusion is that the author being based in the university of adelaide had to make his bow in the direction of global capitalism as he also benefits from it the university after all is famous for its ties with corporations and the australian defense industry
5018121 should be analyzed of its process and conditions out of the available discourses ideology masquerading as coherence and plenitude is in reality inconsistent
5018122 limited contradictory and the realist text as a crystallization of ideology participates in this incompleteness even while it diverts attention from the fact in the apparent plenitude of narrative closure it is the mode of production the materials and then the arrangement is the work
5018123 becomes plural open to re reading no longer an object for passive consumption but an object of work by the reader to produce meaning
5018124 belgian writer and journalist who has written extensively on the geo political aims of natos war against yugoslavia and author of two books on the balkans liars poker and monopoly the question should be
5018125 it is political and violates international law it involves a dangerous precedent for all that bush and company are preparing
5018126 tribunal that has no legal basis largely funded from not disinterested private finance soros rockefeller time warner that refuses to try the crimes committed in ex yugoslavia by washington prot g s not to mention natos own crimes
5018127 supreme court of belgrade had declared the extradition of milosevic illegal but the flemish government or that of brussels carried out the extradition nonetheless everyone knows that the djnidjic government carried out their transfer in exchange for a reward that the united states didnt even pay him
5018128 in 1980 the international court of justice condemned president reagan for having mined the ports of nicaragua with the goal of destabilizing the leftist sandinista government there the us stopped recognizing the court
5018129 it is out of the question that any us citizen can be charged for crimes he may have committed and the us marines would go and rescue him by force no matter where in the world the trial would be taking place
5018130 the masters of the world claim that they are judging milosevic but refuse to judge chiles general augusto pinochet or israels ariel sharon the latter can illegally occupy palestine practice apartheid ethnic cleansing by steps and terror yet he continues to receive billions and billions of dollars and euros and europe doesnt raise its little finger
5018131 milosevic has been attacked not for crimes he might have committed but because he resisted the imf and the multinationals that wanted to control his country the most important dimension of this trial is bush is threatening more and more countries that are rebellious north korea iraq even iran guerillas in colombia philippines underscoring mine and tomorrow still others the goal of this trial is to intimidate all the other third world leaders who follow a course of resistance to multinationals it is a trial of intimidation
5018132 1989 when he tended to introduc e capitalism to yugoslavia all the while hoping to control it
5018133 the colossal price hikes homes deprived of electricity massive loss of jobs
5018134 having utilized islamic terrorists from bin ladens movement to break up yugoslavia and to divide the peoples in bosnia in kosovo and in macedonia even
5018135 clinton blair german chancellor helmut kohl and the us and german secret services for their clandestine work in yugoslavia
5018136 it is as if sharon is judging palestinian premier yassir arafat
5018137 to grant muslims significant governing autonomy and the right to live under shariah law in an expanded area of the archipelagos southern island
5018138 removing muslims from the rest of philippine society and enabling them to shape an entirely separatist mentality that dreams of carving out a pan islamic state from other existing countries in the region such as malaysia indonesia and singapore
5018139 yeah i wanted this one thing so i went to the store i like in france heidelberg to buy it
5018140 we hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority
5018141 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
5018142 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
5018143 we think cap and trade is an important way to go
5018144 it fits in better with what other jurisdictions are doing and it guarantees emission reductions
5018145 this is an exploration of an area of emissions trading that could be included in a future program for us
5018146 if farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers in a better way and reduce those emissions that come off their field then were further ahead in terms of the total amount of greenhouse gases that are getting released from human operations
5018147 instead of opening up the soil by tilling it really actively where you get a lot of carbon released and get nitrous oxide released during that process if you keep it closed it keeps the carbon sequestered in the soil
5018148 by growing new trees youre taking carbon out of the air and youre putting it into the wood and sequestering it there
5018149 on a national scale we are 10 per cent of the problem with greenhouse gas emissions but we can be 20 per cent of the solution
5018150 and the pilots that are being identified here in ontario are also things that can be used at the national scale
5018151 society has to recognize farmers are willing to do this but we cant do it were not paid to assist
5018152 this is not a widespread please come on down and sign up routine yet this is just trying to find a few producers to make sure all the dang bugs are out of the system before we go full scale
5018153 i am going to get some advice but i think i might wade in here to set some of the record straight with the media
5018154 we are being crucified on why the taser usage and our members actions at the preliminary stages
5018155 just watched the taser video on bbc tv in australia
5018156 and we hope that when more of the facts are made public it will present a clearer picture of truly what happened
5018157 sgt pierre lemaitre should be fired for purposely misrepresenting the facts and suppressing the video on a false premise
5018158 it appears you have been caught in an outright lie
5018159 in the world of communications police have often been criticized for not giving details and or information regarding an incident resulting in allegations that we are hiding something
5018160 as for myself as a spokesperson in the future i will consider saying that we have no comment theres an ongoing investigation and weather the storm of media criticism that we are not forthcoming
5018161 we have to ensure that we have an open relationship with the media because we rely on the media to get the message out to the public
5018162 so how are you going to lie your way out of this one
5018163 when will charges of manslaughter be brought against the officers
5018164 seeing as there will be no proper action taken against the criminals i should hope a similar fate befalls their families
5018165 after the millions of good things that we have done it was very disheartening to see that level of backlash and anger from the public
5018166 i see on the news eight people have died in five years thats about 1 5 a year how many would have died if we didnt have the taser
5018167 of those eight how many had pre existing conditions that likely contributed if not were the cause of death
5018168 stand by for the autopsy results we might be in for a surprise like tasers didnt kill this guy pre existing medical conditions and or drugs in the system wait and see
5018169 in an unprecedented action and in contradiction to his request of the prior week
5018170 this left no legal basis for the videotape to be held

5018176 he is the kind of person who doesnt care about pressure
5018177 extricate the masses of the people from the dire straits in which they find themselves
5018178 attend to these statistics from the allegheny county department of human services point in time surveys of july 2007 and january 2008 as you consider them keep in mind that every number represents a child a family in extreme need the average age of a homeless child was 8 8 in july in january 2008 it was 7 8 the number of homeless families with children unsheltered living in emergency shelters or living in transitional housing in january 2007 was 177 with the number of family members served at 479 in january 2008 the number was 693 families with 471 members since a child spends anywhere from only a few days to just a few months in a given shelter most of the children counted in these surveys are forced to adapt to several different shelters and schools each year that exacts a terrible toll on a young mind and spirit
5018179 let me just say that my office has received information of the airport trying to avoid the oversight by this committee but this committee and myself will not be detoured from exposing the alleged illegal activities as well as all the other alleged abuses that are happening at the airport
5018180 fours a crowd after her divorce laura horn second from right decided to have her ex husband guess who removed from the picture with
5018181 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
5018182 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
5018183 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
5018184 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
5018185 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
5018186 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
5018187 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
5018188 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
5018189 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
5018190 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
5018191 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
5018192 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
5018193 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
5018194 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
5018195 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
5018196 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
5018197 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
5018198 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
5018199 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
5018200 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
5018201 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
5018202 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
5018203 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
5018204 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
5018205 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
5018206 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
5018207 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
5018208 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
5018209 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
5018210 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
5018211 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
5018212 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
5018213 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
5018214 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
5018215 both are intent on bucking what has become a disturbing trend for players in their position
5018216 gordon could come through the party conference have a successful relaunch and get back on track only to throw it all away by losing a by election in november
5018217 we should do it now before the mps are back at westminster if we lost in november with mps all back no one knows what would happen
5018218 we hope the release will help strengthen the peace process
5018219 president mahmud abbas had requested the release of very large numbers of prisoners eventually leading to the release of all palestinian prisoners from israeli jails
5018220 whoever engages in dialogue with israel can be boosted through dialogue and not through the use of force

5018224 a roadside bomb struck a police vehicle there were 10 policemen in the car who were all killed
5018225 it was a dangerous gang which was trained in pakistan and was responsible for the killing of about 30 tribal chiefs in the past three or four years
5018226 there was an explosion on the small beach of gualdalmar there was no damage
5018227 there had been two other bomb alerts and the areas had been evacuated

5018239 yang terpenting adalah membuat peluang mencetak gol saat lawan benfica sebenarnya kami banyak membuat peluang dan seharusnya bisa mencetak empat gol belum lagi di babak kedua seharusnya kami mendapat hadiah penalti ketika diriku dijatuhkan lawan

5018274 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5018275 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5018276 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5018277 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5018278 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5018279 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5018280 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5018281 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5018282 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5018283 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5018284 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5018285 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5018286 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5018287 heil euch jungs die werw lfe des eifel und ardennenlandes liegen bereit schon ewig und f r alle zeit
5018288 the early pioneers in this area referred to this place as zion because it was a biblical reference but they interpreted it to mean a place of refuge or sanctuary
5018289 the true first light is on temples and towers when they get that first burst of light when its really nice light for a very fleeting moment
5018290 this area used to be like the sahara desert only larger and later this sand became sandstone and as its been eroded by the virgin river
5018291 weeping rock is a spot where a spring over your head there will be constantly dripping water out and that water is hundreds if not thousands of years old
5018292 in zion as big as it is if you trek off a half a mile in any direction you can end up in a small side canyon and have a real sense of being connected to the land
5018293 we hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority
5018294 i felt good going into the final i had no reason to believe that i wasnt one of the people contending for a gold i got on that line to win
5018295 at the end of the day im not upset its my second olympics im happy to be here i put my heart on the track and it wasnt a stellar time for me but i did well
5018296 eu vi watchmen bom para car o acordo de confidencialidade que assinei n o permite que eu revele muito mas posso dizer o seguinte com muito prazer zack snyder e companhia conseguiram lembra daquela sensa o de assistir sin city na telona e ficar impressionado com a tradu o fidel ssima ao material de origem em termos tanto de visual quando de conte do multiplique isso por tr s e voc ter uma id ia do que watchmen mesmo alan moore deve estar surpreso com a semelhan a do filme com a hq mar o tem que chegar logo
5018297 spontaneity is the quality of being able to do something just because you feel like it at the moment of trusting your instincts of taking yourself by surprise
5018298 i think hes nice and i think hes sincere in what he says
5018299 im probably the only person in this town that does
5018300 mccain will have problems getting a high turnout among those voters unless he finds some way to identify with them some way to make them think that a hes not connected to bush and b his economic plan is superior to obamas
5018301 john mccain continues to hear the concerns of rural families thats why he has made every effort to engage these voters on his plans to create jobs and provide relief for working families
5018302 were getting a great response in rural communities that have been ignored by washington and left behind in the bush economy
5018303 im considering it but i dont want any of them
5018304 what if they get in there and make it worse
5018305 if you are not a liberal at age 20 you dont have a heart if you are not a conservative at age 40 you dont have a brain
5018306 if youre a neoconservative then youre going through a second childhood at age 60 minus both heart and brain
5018307 its a missed opportunity one we dont get back one that falls squarely on the shoulders of the bush administration
5018308 if the blms goal was to maximize revenue we would have weakened the protections on top of the roan plateau
5018309 theres no question that significant money was left on the table from the state of colorados perspective
5018310 i discovered that john cassavetes box set that my roommate had and i watched the films and i was really really intrigued especially by opening night
5018311 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5018312 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
5018313 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
5018314 i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
5018315 i had faith that this eventually would happen its an incredible emotional experience to see two men i know and love finally get married
5018316 im really happy for them that theyre able to seal a union thats been long and wonderful they really love each other
5018317 i thought he was attractive and i liked his eyes
5018318 people think of love as a feeling but feelings come and go
5018319 when you approach love as a commitment then you achieve permanence i reached a point when i realized this is a relationship i wanted to last
5018320 i remain very hopeful that voters in this state will understand that love and commitment fairness and equality are values important regardless of sexual orientation
5018321 were neighbors were friends and were co workers people know us and it would be awfully hard for folks to say we shouldnt have the right to love and have a commitment
5018322 the constitution cant legislate behavior thats not the purpose of the constitution

5018358 russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody
5018359 im not quite sure why this deputy chief of staff felt compelled to make those kinds of threats
5018360 we just want those in russia who seem to be willing to look to the future people perhaps like president dmitry medvedev to perhaps begin to exercise more influence here and get some of these peoples rhetoric under control
5018361 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5018362 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not all respected by chinese officials inside tibet

5018377 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
5018378 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees
5018379 all the government offices and services were on alert during the ceremony
5018380 the pilgrims were aware that these measures were for their safety and to protect them from terrorist attacks
5018381 there was collaboration between baghdad police and neighbouring provinces of karbala there were special forces from the ministry of interior who also took part
5018382 this was the most successful ceremony since the fall of the saddam hussein regime because we did not face any problems as we marched for seven days to reach karbala
5018383 i had no fear this year the pilgrimage was successful
5018384 this is an issue that is not on the table
5018385 president musharraf has been a good ally and everyone knows that we disagreed with his decision in terms of the state of emergency that he declared but he was just to his word he took off his uniform it is now a democratic government in pakistan
5018386 i want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5018387 we have been supportive of their new democratic government as witnessed by the presidents meetings with prime minister gilani so this is a matter for pakistan to determine
5018388 thank you nothing much but awesomeness for those who missed out they might return early next year en route from australia look out for it
5018389 a roadside bomb struck a police vehicle there were 10 policemen in the car who were all killed

5018411 i hope he intends to honor the pledge this time
5018412 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5018413 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5018414 dolores had no hobbies made no contribution to society and rarely shared a kind word or deed in her life i speak for the majority of her family when i say her presence will not be missed by many very few tears will be shed and there will be no lamenting over her passing

5018417 here should be an objective of government itself to provide at least as much assistance to the little fellow as it is now giving to the large banks and corporations
5018418 when you depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave
5018419 boldface and italics headings or links in online text can make a powerful contribution to how credible and persuasive it is
5018420 the organic label may conjure an image of a simpler agriculture but its very existence is an industrial artifact
5018421 so is an industrial organic food chain finally a contradiction in terms its hard to escape the conclusion that it is of course it is possible to live with contradictions at least for a time and sometimes it is necessary or worthwhile
5018422 the inspiration for organic was to find a way to feed ourselves more in keeping with the logic of nature to build a food system that looked more like an ecosystem that would draw its fertility and energy from the sun
5018423 the lot of the workers who harvested the vegetables and gathered up rosie for slaughter is not appreciably different from that of those on nonorganic factory farms
5018424 to a remarkable extent farmers succeeded in creating the new food chain on their farms the trouble began when they encountered the expectations of the supermarket
5018425 natures logic has proven no match for the logic of capitalism one in which cheap energy has always been a given
5018426 in many respects the same factory model is at work in both fields but for every chemical input used in the farms conventional fields a more benign organic input has been substituted in the organic ones
5018427 inputs and outputs a much greener machine but a machine nevertheless
5018428 michael ableman one of the self described beyond organic farmers i interviewed in california said we may have to give up on the organic to be honest im not sure i want that association because what im doing on my farm is not just substituting inputs
5018429 the word organic has proved to be one of the most powerful words in the supermarket without any help from government farmers and consumers working together in this way have built an 11 billion industry that is now the fastest growing sector of the food economy
5018430 agribusiness fought to define the word loosely as possible in part to make it easier for mainstream companies to get into organic but also out of fear that anything deemed not organic would henceforth carry an official stigma
5018431 one word frees us of all the weight and pain of life that word is love
5018432 send a strong signal to the audience that ive scrutinized my own position and can therefore be trusted
5018433 before well listen to others we usually must respect their authority admire their integrity and motives or at least acknowledge what they stand for
5018434 its between no 10 this year 2 07 million and what detwilers contract was 2 15 million thats the appropriate value its fairly easy to figure out
5018435 woe is me the nationals are such victims being bullied by this big bad agent
5018436 it ended up being all emails we kept trying to engage in discussion
5018437 we never got to real negotiations until the absolute very last minute because both sides overplayed our hands in the preliminary negotiations it was a debacle for both sides and we need to learn lessons from this

5018455 we started with everything we could in the first 500 to get ourselves into the race essentially through the middle its a dogfight and everybody wants a piece of it
5018456 we knew that we had a really solid 500 and it was just a matter of not waiting for it but going everyone together we closed our eyes and went for it
5018457 coming into the last 500 we seemed to get our rhythm and iain said go for it so we committed everything we had and went
5018458 we knew it was tight we really had no idea where we were when we started that sprint

5018487 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5018488 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5018489 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5018490 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5018491 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5018492 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5018493 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5018494 the dynamics here are different than they ever have been
5018495 but i believe well wind up ahead weve got the volunteers the excitement his call for economic change the trade issue a lot of these things make north carolina fertile territory for us
5018496 i dont disavow that on paper this could be closer than last time and obama is spending money
5018497 my question is can you move this 13 14 points from where you were when you had a north carolinian on the ticket
5018498 jays time with us has been mutually beneficial and i will keep my eyes open for any movement but it is not looking likely in the coming month he is now in a period that he can get under his managers nose after good season with us and try to get in ars nes wenger plans
5018499 but he did come to see us last week he kindly returned the dvds that i borrowed off him a while ago jay is a smashing lad with huge potential
5018500 they clearly drew a bright line separating themselves on some issues
5018501 but what was distinct here was they did it without smashing each other
5018502 if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent on that belief then i cant argue with you on that but there are ways that we can work together to reduce unwanted pregnancies
5018503 i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade not because i am pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually
5018504 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5018505 you do everything you can to get that decision right
5018506 all those questions surrounding the war have been very difficult for me
5018507 the warrens give away 90 percent of their income through three charities acts of mercy which serves people with aids equipping leaders which trains leaders in developing countries and the global p e a c e fund which fights poverty disease corruption and illiteracy using local congregations
5018508 americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5018509 i think that americas greatest moral failure has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest
5018510 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade and come to that conclusion not because im pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually
5018511 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5018512 if you are making 150 000 or less as a family youre middle class i would argue if youre making more than 250 000 then youre in the top 3 or 4 percent in this country youre doing well under the approach im taking if youre making 150 000 or less you will see a tax cut
5018513 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich i dont believe in class warfare or redistribution of the wealth i dont want to raise anybodys taxes
5018514 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since aug 7
5018515 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5018516 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5018517 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5018518 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato
5018519 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear

5018532 copyright cannot be understood merely as a grudgingly tolerated way station on the road to the public domain
5018533 because copyright arises out of the act of creating a work authors have moral claims that neither corporate intermediaries nor consumer end users can assert
5018534 the logic of property rights dictates their extension into every corner in which people derive enjoyment and value from literary and artistic works
5018535 to see that there was such a thing as the environment rather than just my pond your forest his canal we need to do the same thing in the information environment we have to invent the public domain before we can save it
5018536 no matter how thin you slice it there are always two sides
5018537 make certain that you have proper expectations regarding the things that can and cannot come from relationships

5018560 russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody
5018561 im not quite sure why this deputy chief of staff felt compelled to make those kinds of threats

5018569 hes a genuinely enthusiastic traveller with his feet on the ground
5018570 i realized how much was revealed everything is revealed its political realities economic realities its human condition how i felt about a place in the past and how i feel now
5018571 with that trip i felt such a continuous sense of discovery self discovery and discovery i thought maybe the ultimate in this would be to take the same trip again a trip that had meant a lot to me in 1973
5018572 the sort of place that gives rise to the notion that the earth is flat

5018578 a kind of one upmanship on the way everyone else travels museums bad slums good solitude good companions bad airlines bad railways good it is a code and hes very strict about it and sometimes it seems so strict that im a little puzzled about the notion of purity it creates
5018579 the longer i stayed in bangalore the less i liked it

5018583 otherwise why have i written as i have theres some emptiness or disorder that ones trying to fill or find an order in if you look into history you wont find many jolly well balanced people who were writers i mean look at them

5018585 i grew up in the 60s with the idea it was the most wonderful place in the world to live
5018586 one of the first mass cultural images of the south and of course its not the african american story at all its not the southern story at all
5018587 i felt like the lord brought us to shelby to do battle with our own pasts and with our own stories about our pasts
5018588 is a kind of a commitment that many generations of southerners black and white have made to try to have a multiracial democracy and try to redeem the u s constitution and the declaration of independence into more than words
5018589 who were caught between doing what was the right thing to do in terms of their faith and keeping bread on their table and having a job
5018590 that part of the story had a real wonderful resonance to me and i knew that having lived through that i could tell that story
5018591 in this story its human beings who are flawed imperfect and caught in a hard history and they are grappling to make sense of it and to fix what cannot be fixed
5018592 its not about saints and heroes but its about ordinary people like ourselves
5018593 we really have to tell the story and tell it in a way that is correct that is truthful and honest
5018594 hollywood has a way sometimes to kind of give people what they think people are ready for rather than what the truth is
5018595 it was never my intention to show the south at its best
5018596 i continually surprised myself in terms of the depth of the anger from the black community the depth of the frustration
5018597 am i bringing all that to the screen i guarantee you im not and i feel like i didnt make this movie to be the white director making the black experience but i am a director telling a story and that i can do
5018598 i hope that what we are telling is a kind of human history in which we can see the faces of people that we know and that we are and that as we struggle to find meaning in our past that well manage to find hope in our future
5018599 will i ever be able to find work that i really enjoy again

5018631 as far as we know clinically we havent seen an increase in tumors
5018632 i cant refute the article but its hard to believe an application of moisturizer to most people who have had some exposure to the sun over the years that this would promote tumors
5018633 there are too many open questions to extrapolate from mice to humans

5018788 until now it hasnt been easy for users of joomla sites to find previous articles
5018789 we thought that was a waste of good content so when our magazine and news portal customers asked if we had a search or an archive extension we knew what to do

5018791 by backing our products with a 100 money back guarantee we are letting people know that we really believe in our products and we also let our customers know that they can buy from us with confidence

5018894 i never really felt that writing about medford mass had a future
5018895 a kind of one upmanship on the way everyone else travels museums bad slums good solitude good companions bad airlines bad railways good it is a code and hes very strict about it and sometimes it seems so strict that im a little puzzled about the notion of purity it creates
5018896 the longer i stayed in bangalore the less i liked it
5018897 the place had not evolved it had been crudely transformed less city planning than the urban equivalent of botched cosmetic surgery

5018899 it didnt look like this it didnt smell like this it wasnt as crowded as this at night the roads were totally empty it was like the twilight zone going through the darkness
5018900 otherwise why have i written as i have theres some emptiness or disorder that ones trying to fill or find an order in if you look into history you wont find many jolly well balanced people who were writers i mean look at them
5018901 in a way you cant be a writer unless you have sort of a personality problem balanced people dont become writers obviously balanced people become gardeners they raise happy families they go to work every day they smile they have noodle salad

5018933 today i concentrated only on my moves not the medals

5018959 i havent figured out exactly how this is managed but i am confident that we are going to be able to find a church we feel comfortable with and that will reflect our concerns and values
5018960 i thought given that this is a presidential season and that sen obama is a member of the church there was going to be some type of fall out i didnt know the exact nature of it

5018988 the use of force plays a role but may be less important than measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
5018989 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
5018990 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
5018991 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
5018992 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
5018993 if even the people who created the character nicolae carpathia dont see the comparisons as warranted then perhaps this is overblown

5018998 i dont like the idea of his being 80 at the end of his second term
5018999 as people get up in age they get sick more often and mccain has had cancer

5019055 numai cine sta in preajma sportivului cunoaste sacrificiile imense pe care acesta este obligat sa le faca pentru o medalie am mers deseori cu sora mea mai mare atat in cantonamente cat si la concursuri imi amintesc anul trecut la maratonul de la londra ca m au trecut fiorii cand i am vazut talpile picioarele dupa ce si a scos pantofii erau pline de sange
5019056 eram in ultimul an de liceu cand a fost remarcata de profesorul de sport acesta a vazut in mine o mare campioana astfel ca m a recomandat unui antrenor din targu jiu iar de aici a inceput drumul meu spre marea performanta
5019057 dimineata alergam pe ulitele din sat pentru ca nu aveam pista aici iar dupa amiaza mergeam la targu jiu si ma antrenam pe stadion
5019058 raphael fiul meu este cea mai mare realizare de altfel el e talismanul meu norocos dupa ce l am nascut si am revenit in competitie au inceput sa apara si rezultatele internationale
5019059 schimbarea mi a fost benefica in 2004 castigam maratonul de la chicago pentru ca un an mai tarziu sa devin campioana mondiala de semimaraton la edmonton si sa obtin bronzul la maraton in cadrul mondialelor de la helsinki
5019060 nimeni nu mi dadea credit spuneau ca sunt prea batrana pentru atletism acum la beijing le am demonstrat ca s au inselat
5019061 la antrenamente am simtit o sensibilitate la tendon o zi mai tarziu nici nu mai puteam calca am facut infiltratii cu cortizon dar pentru ca doctorul mi a recomandat o luna de repaus am ratat mondialele
5019062 avea dureri mari si a facut infiltratii pentru a putea alerga in china

5019067 governor blagojevich and the illinois senate president emil jones needs to come clean now about any side deals they made to fund pork barrel projects
5019068 their attempts to stonewall the release of these documents demonstrate a shocking lack of respect for both illinois taxpayers and the rule of law
5019069 for years the governor and senate president emil jones have been conducting a cynical game of hide amp seek with taxpayers funds
5019070 instead of following the law which clearly states that requests for information from our state government must be fulfilled the governor and senator jones apparently think they are above the law and simply do not need to comply we intend to prove them wrong
5019071 no matter what the outcome of this lawsuit may bring illinois needs stronger disclosure laws that would force lawmakers to vote on projects before they become reality
5019072 afp il worked with the general assembly this year to pass such a law while it passed the house unanimously the senate did not see fit to call it for a vote
5019073 many lawmakers agree with us that their actions must be open to review and accountability measures
5019074 it shouldnt take a lawsuit to force officials elected by the people of this state to do the right thing
5019075 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5019076 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5019077 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5019078 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato
5019079 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear
5019080 i think japan is probably one of the most unpredictable teams in the tournament
5019081 their attacking style is lots of numbers very quick movement of the ball and all 11 players involved in moving the ball forward so its very tough to defend them i think what it proves to us is they are very strong under pressure
5019082 they were in a must win by many goals against norway in group play and they did it they were in a must win against china in the quarterfinals with the entire country cheering for china and they did it were going to have a really tough battle on our hands tomorrow
5019083 weve played four great games against different opponents with different styles and theyve been tight games
5019084 the more minutes this team has together the better our play is what is significant for the team is weve created a lot of chances and i think weve played some nice soccer

5019089 t toen heeft jeremias willem walg de burgemeester een grote pot vol goud uitgeloofd voor wie de ratten verjagen k kon
5019090 k krijg ik de pot met goud als ik de ratten wegjaag
5019091 ja zei de burgemeester toen maar laat eerst maar zien wat je kunt
5019092 nou ons dat laten zien d dat heeft ie gedaan die rare gast hij kon wat niemand anders lukte met een fluitje speelde de rattenvanger rare liedjes l lieiedjes die we niet eens konden horen maar de ratten wel en t toen ging hij weg met al die akelige enge ratten achter hem aan
5019093 w we waren nog nooit zo blij geweest als toen al die nare beesten weg waren maar toen kwam de rattenvanger terug voor zijn p pot met goud onze burgemeester had helemaal geen zin om een pot vol goud weg te geven en voor wat een beetje rare liedjes tierelieren die niemand kon horen en de burgemeester zei toen zomaar d dat er geen goud was dat alles was opgevreten door de de ratten weet je wat ie toen gedaan heeft die rare snoeshaan hij zei niets geen boef of bah nee hij ging heel heel stilletjes weg maar niet ver
5019094 bertram bierebroodspot de de knapste jongeling van hamelen ook al die was net m met zijn vriendinnetje lidwientje walg de enige dochter van de burgemeester aan het voetje vrijen buiten de stadspoort lidwientje en bertram gingen ook al dromen en toen zomaar huppelen zomaar volgden we die fluiter en de rattenvanger bleef blazen in het oor van elk kind dat probeerde wakker te worden 55 kinderen zijn toen meegelopen alle allemaal op blote voetjes in hun nachtponnetjes m maar hildebrandt brom heeft ons gezien hij is de stadsomroeper en klepperman hij heeft ons zien lopen en hij heeft uit alle macht geprobeerd om ons tegen te houden en wakker te ma maken maar niks hoor alle kinderen bertram ikke en zelfs lidwientje we volgden allemaal zo zo braaf als de ratten de fluiter tot hij ineens zomaar ophield met fluiten en wat denk je waar we toen waren zomaar midden in een hele grote rotsharde berg er was geen mogelijkheid om doorheen terug te komen nou we gingen meteen zoeken naar een uit uitgang maar die vonden we niet we vonden wel gruizel gruis dat is een raar dwergje in groen pak met een lange grijze baard en hij zat opgesloten in een z zilveren kooi we hebben hem vrijgelaten en als dank heeft hij bertram geschopt toen is hij door een deur weggegaan en dat was zo mal want het was een dichtgemetselde deur
5019095 er waren drie van die dichtgemetselde deuren dat vonden we al zo r raar maar toen we ook door die middelste van die v vreemde deuren gingen zagen we een vreemd land er vlogen pratende vogels rond het gras was oranje van kleur en de bloemen waren groen en hoe we ook zochten we we zaten allemaal gevangen in dat rare land
5019096 kunt kunt u mij de weg naar h hamelen vertellen meneer

5019139 de rechtspraak werd geleid door de heer van het kasteel the black raven james macraven de vijfde vier mannen werden ervan verdacht een rijke boer te hebben overvallen het waren twee broers en hun twee zonen
5019140 de jongste van de zonen kreeg vrijspraak van de heer maar enkel als hij de andere drie zou ophangen hij was net zestien jaar oud
5019141 de drie mannen besloten zich niet te verzetten tegen het vonnis ze klommen op het bankje en die stakkerd hoefde ze er alleen maar van af te duwen nadat het gebeurd was had die arme knul zo een verdriet dat hij zichzelf op probeerde te hangen maar dat mislukte de jongen mocht als knecht bij de herberg werken jaren later werd bekend dat de drie mannen onschuldig waren geweest de twee mannen die het wel gedaan hadden werden eveneens opgehangen die jongen duwde ook hen van het bankje af vanaf dat moment was hij de plaatselijke beul

5019160 de helft is voor jou als je me swarts brengt
5019161 nog voor er drie dagen om zijn breng ik je zijn hoofd
5019162 ik mot m levend vergeet dat niet sirius swarts moet hier weer hoog en droog opgesloten worden en dan zal ik eindelijk loonsverhoging krijgen denk er goed om je krijgt geen cent als hij ook maar n krasje heeft
5019163 ik moet toch eens een nieuwe kooi voor je kopen hedwig

5019168 het is dankzij mij op ons werk ook prima geregeld dan hoeft het werk helemaal niet lang te duren dan is alles zo hup aan kant net zoals jij dit huishouden drijft mijn liefje ik hoorde laatst meneer saaistra zeggen dat zijn vrouw de netheid van ons huis had bewonderd ze beweerde dat je een werkster had
5019169 onzin heb ik gezegd mijn vrouw is prima georganiseerd zij doet elke dag het hele huis in een paar uurtjes en de meubels zien er nog gloednieuw uit

5019174 hij was hier wie eh wie is die hij meester
5019175 ik zag hem in de spiegel dat brutale joch heeft me niet eens opgeroepen zelfs al zou hij het kunnen
5019176 heb je nu eindelijk iets gevonden waarmee ik me kan wreken op die potter dood moet hij en snel ook
5019177 hij moet te vinden zijn wormstaart en ik zal me op hem wreken heb je echt niks gevonden waarmee ik harry potter kan doden
5019178 bah waar kan dat snotjoch toch uithangen krijg ik eindelijk de kans zweinstein binnen te komen dan is ie er niet eens
5019179 oh maar u heeft ze een leuke verrassing bereid h meester
5019180 ach wat zweinstijn zo goed beveiligd tegen inbrekers ik liet de hele boel ontploffen met n vingerknip
5019181 dat joch houdt zich ergens verborgen maar mijn dienaar doet zijn uiterste best om mij de schuilplaats van dat kleine smerige rotjochie te verraden hij is goede maatjes met perkamentus geworden beweert ie en het is maar een kwestie van tijd voor ik hem heb
5019182 het zal vast niet lang meer duren meester voor onze vriend u het goede nieuws komt brengen
5019183 jouw gesnuffel als rat heeft toch zin gehad ik weet nu waar hij woont en ik heb eindelijk bedacht hoe ik hem het beste te grazen kan nemen we gaan naar de wegisweg en we gaan een verjaardagscadeautje kopen
5019184 het was jouw schuld valse leugenaar als jij niet zo nodig twee toverboeken moest hebben kon ik er nog wel mee wegkomen
5019185 heel uit de verte was de boosaardige stem nog te horen
5019186 het leek wel of er niemand in die wagen zat
5019187 is is dit net zo erg als de z zomer van de om omgegooide te tenten
5019188 die vreselijke dag waaiden alle tenten om en sloegen de paarden op hol we waren drie dagen bezig om ze allemaal te vinden
5019189 dit is alleen maar poteto een scheet van storm mato oth ratynehee
5019190 is het niet beter om aan komen rijden als te lopen we kunnen mijn vader de buik vol laten vreten en hij zal tevreden over mij zijn
5019191 breng me een oude huid en riemen we zullen hem bij de begraafplaats neerleggen en als iemand voor een jonge onervaren paardendief komt kunnen we hem meegeven
5019192 er zijn er nog zeven vier in het gras drie bij die rode struik daar
5019193 geel gras vertelde over de dood van de jonge paardendief
5019194 a alleen als je me zweert h hier niets mee te te nemen wat n niet van jou is
5019195 w welkom bij de de stam van het p paard
5019196 laat ons eerst een bad nemen je moeder wil vast geen modder in haar tent
5019197 the administrations mis governance was having its effect and we could not carry the koda baggage any more
5019198 the situation had worsened the state administrative machinery had become defunct so we had to withdraw ourselves from the ministry
5019199 we have asked the governor to take a final decision in the matter
5019200 i would say that she should go for a compromise land once taken cannot be returned moreover neither government nor the tatas will back out of the project the project is the only one of its kind in the country attempts to damage the walls of the factory will be of no use
5019201 but on enquiry it was known that the land was low lying and not fit for setting up units herein lies the problem
5019202 i cannot say what it trinamool congress is doing elsewhere in the country it has said it is not with the bjp it is trying for unity with the congress i do not think there will be anything open but it will be covert
5019203 it will get a thorough vetting at our board meeting tonight
5019204 i do not feel there is any point in trying to pull back from those discussions
5019205 we would be in effect making available to our customers up to 5 million gallons a day
5019206 what i ask in this suggestion here is taht we go back and revisit that study that we did years ago and update it
5019207 there is a body out in the citizenry that will be re interested in all of these issues as time goes on
5019208 we really need to have both sides of the story
5019209 i know were taking steps to ensure that no water is being used frivolously
5019210 all of our plumbing has been inspected for leaks and plumbing work orders particularly those that may address leaks have been given a top priority
5019211 i think the most important thing that we have done is focus on water conservation education with our students
5019212 it is a statewide concern so that teachers have some premade materials that they can use for students and teach them the importance of being good stewards of the natural resources that we do have available to us
5019213 i think that owasas been great youre not worrying about being reelected you can make maybe better decisions in conservation and the like
5019214 please stay away from kids and expectant mothers till the next 24 hours
5019215 shia militant groups and afghan warlords to attack american and allied forces
5019216 any threat to the peace breach of the peace or act of aggression
5019217 may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail sea air postal telegraphic radio and other means of communication and the severance of diplomatic relations
5019218 call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures
5019219 agreed yesterday to seek new sanctions against iran over its nuclear program after the country failed to meet a weekend deadline to respond to an offer
5019220 we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
5019221 calling on the administration to focus on the urgency of the iranian threat and to impose tougher sanctions on tehran
5019222 to enhance united states diplomatic efforts with respect to iran by imposing additional economic sanctions against iran and for other purposes
5019223 authorize s state and local governments to direct divestiture from and prevent investment in companies with investments of 20 000 000 or more in irans energy sector
5019224 support ing israels quest for peace and press ing the arab states to do more to support israeli palestinian talks
5019225 the radical regime in iran has sponsored terrorism against the united states israel and the west for decades
5019226 the worlds leading state sponsor of terror noting its support for groups such as hamas hizballah and islamic jihad
5019227 insurgency in iraq supplied arms to the taliban and hosted al qaeda terrorists
5019228 relentlessly pursu es nuclear weapons and thus is a particularly implacable and lethal regime
5019229 only a sustained unified international effort to isolate and sanction iran is likely to convince it to give up these dangerous activities
5019230 speaking from the heart as a true friend of israel when i visit with aipac i am among friends good friends who share my strong commitment that the bond between the united states and israel is unbreakable today tomorrow and forever
5019231 by israel in the face of all threats speak s up when israels security is at risk and voices concern that americas recent foreign policy hasnt made israel more secure hamas now controls gaza hizbollah has tightened its grip on southern lebanon and is flexing its muscles in beirut because of the war in iraq iran which always posed a greater threat to israel than iraq is emboldened and poses the greatest strategic challenge to the us and israel in the middle east in a generation we must isolate hamas syria continues its support for terror and meddling in lebanon and pursu es weapons of mass destruction there is no greater threat to israel or to the peace and stability of the region than iran it supports violent extremists pursues a nuclear capability and threatens to wipe israel off the map my goal will be to eliminate this threat
5019232 foremost in his mind is the threat posed by the regime in tehran the iranian president calls israel a stinking corpse it uses violence to undermine israel in the middle east peace process it supports extremists in iraq killing american soldiers remains the worlds chief sponsor of terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons poses an unacceptable risk a danger we cannot allow
5019233 the most dangerous regime in the middle east characterized by its cruel despotism and fanatic militancy if this regime acquires nuclear weapons this would presage catastrophic consequences not only for my country not only for the middle east but for all of mankind the fact that iran is building nuclear weapons is beyond question and they may be the worlds first un deterable nuclear power so the danger is clear and the question is what do we do about it my message to you is divest iran
5019234 iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium so the security council has no choice but to increase the sanctions
5019235 national tragedy demagogically justified an economic catastrophe a regional disaster and a global boomerang for the united states
5019236 a historic strategic and moral calamity undertaken under false assumptions it is undermining americas global legitimacy tarnishing our moral credentials and intensifying regional instability
5019237 plausible scenario for a military collision with iran based on iraqi failure to meet the benchmarks followed by accusations of iranian responsibility for the failure then by some provocation in iraq or a terrorist act in the us blamed on iran culminating in a defensive us military action
5019238 a lonely america into a spreading and deepening quagmire eventually ranging across iraq iran afghanistan and pakistan
5019239 when the president flatly asserts iran is seeking nuclear weapons hes overstating the facts we have very scant supportive evidence and after the iraq calamity he should be very careful about the veracity of his public assertions
5019240 if his secretary of state is joe lieberman and his secretary of defense is rudy giuliani we will be moving towards the ww iv counting the cold war as ww iii that they have been both favoring and predicting an appalling concept
5019241 the us did not give the green light for an israeli attack on iran george bush made it clear to all parties that the first option is diplomacy
5019242 it is the absolute responsibility of everybody in uniform to disobey an order that is either illegal or immoral
5019243 not obey illegal and immoral orders to use weapons of mass destruction they cannot commit crimes against humanity
5019244 if sanctions and incentives cannot be made to work the voices for military action will only get louder no matter what aides may be telling mr bush and mr olmert or what they may be telling each other an attack on iran would be a disaster
5019245 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months conventionally
5019246 assault fail to significantly harm or stall the iranian program a nuclear attack will most likely follow
5019247 only one option if it wishes to halt irans march toward nuclear weaponry the military
5019248 which leaves only israel the country threatened almost daily with destruction by irans leaders irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program
5019249 will destroy their nuclear facilities even though this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation
5019250 the nuclear incineration of 70 million iranians and the contamination of the better part of a billion people in the middle east asia and europe
5019251 that appeared to be a rehearsal for a potential bombing attack
5019252 escalating tensions that would peak with an iranian inspired insurgency strike against us
5019253 generations of jihadists and our grandchildren will be battling them in america
5019254 at least ten senior flag and general officers including combatant commanders
5019255 channel 7 had a very deliberate strategy with the yum cha program and that was to dumb it down in order to make it digestible for non sporting viewers
5019256 everything on that program was scripted and sonia has executed the strategy exactly how seven wanted it to play out
5019257 i will probably have a barbecue and drop a card in their mailbox saying listen if you want to meet the neighbours come down and say hello
5019258 this isnt new york this is oregon we are rocking out in oregon yeah
5019259 i want a copy of that can i have a copy of that
5019260 you can do that i didnt know you could do that put the whole thing on youtube or something and i might watch it in a day or so
5019261 it was constant troubleshooting testing research posting to the google apps forums and so on plus theres the emotional strain of wondering whether you completely screwed up by moving everyone to google apps as our sole e mail system thats what freaked me out did google just make me look like an idiot
5019262 i have just been signed up with icm in the states which is pretty huge
5019263 you have just got to keep going over and seeing what is around i am going to go and shake some more hands and meet more people
5019264 el presidente medvedev ha anunciado al presidente de la rep blica francesa nicolas sarkozy que la retirada de sus tropas comenzar ma ana 18 de agosto a mediod a
5019265 consecuencias graves en las relaciones de rusia con la uni n europea
5019266 en georgia ya no existe la noci n de fuerzas de paz rusas no puede haber fuerzas de paz rusas son tropas rusas
5019267 estamos aqu para proteger la poblaci n y poner fin a los saqueos
5019268 georgia ser miembro de la otan si quiere y es lo que quiere
5019269 rusia fue demasiado lejos us la fuerza de forma desproporcionada contra un vecino peque o y ahora est pagando el precio por ello ya que la reputaci n de rusia como socio potencial en las instituciones internacionales qued francamente hecha trizas
5019270 government has been the voice of big business not small business
5019271 voters dont like bad behavior on the part of c e o s but economic populism really doesnt work
5019272 and both guys have to show leadership on the economy
5019273 they have to be seen as thoughtful responsible stewards of economic policy who can get along with business and talk to business
5019274 john talks to and cares about big business but he has the greatest affinity for small business which creates more than 70 percent of the jobs in this country
5019275 his entire lens on economic policy is job creation and small business
5019276 ive gotten calls for a year and half saying tell me about this guy
5019277 says william m daley who served as secretary of commerce in the clinton administration before returning to chicago where he is a senior executive with jpmorgan chase
5019278 ive long admired john mccain and i told him i would be delighted to help him
5019279 and i said i have good news for you john
5019280 mccains style makes the big business crowd uncomfortable but they will back him in the election because of his conservative free market policies
5019281 the small business crowd likes him for reasons of both policy and persona
5019282 i have never run a small struggling business unless you count my presidential campaign last year
5019283 not to denigrate government but to make it better not to deride it but to restore its good name
5019284 when he tells you something i think he really means it
5019285 barack tended to attract the younger up and coming leaders at big firms and people in private equity
5019286 many of them had an interest in economic policy as well we didnt have as many gray hairs at the table so there was room for them
5019287 he was remarkably clear eyed and thoughtful about what the country needed to do
5019288 most businesspeople at the big business level are republicans either knee jerk or born into it
5019289 and no one has wrapped himself around the new technology and the new fund raising space like obama so to that crowd this is a message
5019290 he listened more than he talked which is always a good thing
5019291 he clearly sees himself as a clever synthesizer of other peoples ideas and i think that is an important skill in a president
5019292 i dont think senator obama has an agenda for big business
5019293 hes trying to affect the overall economy and hes got to find a way to help people who are worse off i dont think he loses any sleep worrying about how to craft a policy just for big business nor should he and i say that as a former commerce secretary
5019294 but on the big issues that will determine whether the u s is prosperous and whether we improve the living standards of working people i think hes right
5019295 a few months after receiving his final payment from eki obama sent a request on state senate letterhead urging illinois officials to provide a 50 000 tourism promotion grant to another blackwell company killerspin
5019296 any implication that sen obama would risk an ethical breach in order to secure a small grant for a pingpong tournament is nuts
5019297 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5019298 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5019299 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5019300 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato
5019301 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear
5019302 cuisines of the axis of evil and other irritating states
5019303 das management hat sehr gut verstanden dass dies nicht funktionieren w rde
5019304 wir m ssen ein konzept finden das sowohl mlp als auch swiss life mehrwert bringt ob wir daf r die mehrheit brauchen oder ob das auch ber eine minderheitsbeteiligung in absprache mit herrn lautenschl ger manfred lautenschl ger ist mlp aufsichtsratschef und gro aktion r m glich ist wird sich zeigen
5019305 eine solche transaktion w re f r alle beteiligten wertvernichtend
5019306 schon heute hat das ansehen des konzerns bei den beratern stark gelitten denn die sehen die bisherigen ereignisse eindeutig als unfreundlichen akt
5019307 ich bin wohl etwas zu forsch vorgegangen mlp und awd waren wie zwei geschwister von denen keines den anderen als erziehungsberechtigten akzeptieren wollte
5019308 jetzt haben wir eine traummutter die daf r sorgt dass die geschwister sinnvolle dinge zusammen machen k nnen aber trotzdem eigenst ndig bleiben
5019309 ob wir daf r die mehrheit brauchen oder ob das auch ber eine minderheitsbeteiligung in absprache mit herrn lautenschl ger mlp aufsichtsratschef und gro aktion r m glich ist wird sich zeigen

5019480 but the limit of tolerance for these human foibles is obtained when the proponent of a questionable scientific doctrine endeavors to maintain it against all possible odds by misrepresentation misinformation and suppression of contradictory data and by insinuating unfairness in opponents of his views
5019481 man stands alone in the universe a unique product of a long unconcious impersonal material process with unique understanding and potentialities these he owes to no one but himself and it is to himself that he is responsible he is not the creature of uncontrollable and undeterminable forces but his own master he can and must decide and manage his own destiny

5019486 it has been a very long week for all of us we are all feeling the nine days of racing that we have had here trickett said
5019487 i think for us we just really wanted to swim well for each other i know for me i wanted to finish on a great note and i really wanted to put in my all for the girls and bring the team home as well as i possibly could
5019488 i had a slightly disappointing race in the 50m but all of the girls propped me up and helped me re focus and have a lot of fun and enjoy this moment because it was going to be my last race at this olympics
5019489 before the race for my individual i had a lot of trouble dealing with my nerves and i think i got too many and it kind of made me swim not as good as what i expected i should have swam seebohm said
5019490 then i felt a little bit more pressure coming into this relay and just hoping that i would make the team and then i did the heat swim and i did really well
5019491 in terms of my week i think it has been one of the greatest meets of my life and probably the one where i have had the most fun she said after winning two gold medals and a silver
5019492 to finish on a world record especially by three seconds has been the most exciting
5019493 its been a pretty up and down kind of week for all of us schipper said
5019494 i came into this meet just wanting an individual medal and i have gone home with two this relay swim is pretty cut throat to get a spot on the australian team so to be a part of that is a bonus
5019495 to break the world record by three seconds and win gold has just been the icing on top of a great week
5019496 an indication of the seriousness with which sadc heads of state and government approach this subject
5019497 speedy conclusion to the negotiations so that it becomes possible to address the enormous challenges that face the people of zimbabwe
5019498 now reporters wont have to ask me the same question every four years
5019499 how does it feel to be singapores only olympic medalist
5019500 i did not expect singapore to get to the finals
5019501 im very proud and it doesnt matter to me whether out players were born in china or not
5019502 i arrived here very tired after flying directly from cincinnati
5019503 probably the reason i won it was that i had a fantastic time here enjoying a lot in the village
5019504 he is just playing out of this world at the moment and deserves to be number one
5019505 that is the best thing that has happened to me in my life and my career
5019506 i am very excited to win the silver medal as it is my way of repaying singapore for having confidence in me and grooming me all these years
5019507 its a shame that we lost to singapore in the semi final it was very hard for our team to win the bronze medal because of the team format our success is due to our mental attitudes and effort
5019508 according to the information i have available to me unfortunately this withdrawals have not yet begun
5019509 russia needs to honour the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
5019510 the device failed to calibrate the laser power level for this medium

5019513 two of us were going to try and walk out as a last resort but then it saw us it was a wonderful feeling
5019514 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most you know the difference between potential and kinetic energy they have the most potential energy emphasis added so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest
5019515 this year has been one of the hardest years of my life as well as one of the greatest years of my life
5019516 ill probably take a deep breath and it will all hit me im still on an emotional high
5019517 pozdnyakov is one of the greatest fencers of all time
5019518 i was really fortunate today to stick with the game plan that we developed nobody expected us to but we showed that we can work and do really well

5019520 we just want those in russia who seem to be willing to look to the future people perhaps like president dmitry medvedev to perhaps begin to exercise more influence here and get some of these peoples rhetoric under control
5019521 we have agreed along with our partners in poland and the to give the russians access both physical and technical access so they know whats going on every step of the way
5019522 weve agreed not to even make the interceptors operational until the iranians have test launched a missile that has the range to hit much of not to mention russia so this is really an old song that theyre singing and it really just doesnt play
5019523 you can make these up to one week in advance
5019524 sebetulnya tanaman ini sudah lama tumbuh di kaltim saya menemukannya di beberapa tempat seperti manggar balikpapan dan marangkayu kukar tapi varietas singkong gajah ini hanya dijumpai di wilayah kaltim
5019525 dalam jangka sembilan bulan kalau singkong biasa hasil panennya 2 3 kg dalam satu pokok maka dengan singkong gajah bisa mencapai 10 20 kg
5019526 rasanya juga lebih gurih seperti ada menteganya teksturnya juga sangat lunak tidak seperti singkong biasa yang keras
5019527 saat panen raya desember nanti kami akan menggelar sosialisasi singkong gajah ini dalam bentuk getuk lindri sepanjang 2008 meter rencananya aksi ini akan dicatat dalam museum rekor indonesia muri sampelnya diambil dari daerah penghasil tanaman tersebut di kaltim
5019528 dibuat sebagus apa pun kolamnya sebaik apa pun kualitas airnya dan sebanyak apa pun pemberian pakannya tetap saja kepadatan udang hanya 10 ekor per meter persegi
5019529 mereka tidak pernah memperhatikan kalau udang udang yang bertengger di dekat permukaan air itu justru merasa nyaman karena bisa melakukan prosesi ganti kulit molting tanpa perlu merasa terancam
5019530 kalau nyaman udang bisa ganti kulit terus dan cepat besar
5019531 selain itu arus dalam kolam juga terhambat dan kandungan oksigen terlarutnya turun sehingga udang mudah mati
5019532 tapi dengan apartemen 30 ekor udang itu aman aman saja
5019533 kalau tidak ada udangnya lumut di bambu ini tebal tapi ini bersih
5019534 lihat saja gerakan kakinya udang udang itu mereka sedang membersihkan dirinya sesudah makan

5019578 the guys on the relay team were amazing these guys made it possible the relays made it possible the whole thing every race from winning by one hundredth of a second yesterday to finishing it off with a world record its an amazing experience and something ill have forever
5019579 i went from hitting my head on the wall to winning by one one hundredth of a second to doing my best time in every event its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster its been nothing but fun

5019590 the first thing id like to do to my mum is just hug her said phelps whose parents separated when he was young
5019591 ive literally seen her for about 30 seconds this whole time
5019592 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
5019593 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
5019594 if you want to commit suicide it is up to you but you do not have the right to kill your country
5019595 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5019596 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5019597 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5019598 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5019599 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5019600 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5019601 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5019602 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is

5019608 i still appreciate what theyre doing or what theyre trying to do but i think theyre trying too hard not to be
5019609 i like them as a rock band all the buttons and sequencing and stuff like that i dont really care for im a fan of rock music and what theyre doing now i dont think is very good

5019614 explorers havent left theyre the ones writing the strategy guides
5019615 unfortunately not many people have the type of personality which finds single minded exploring a riveting subject so numbers of explorers are notoriously difficult to increase
5019616 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
5019617 the difference was incredible i watched people transform from low to high achievers in just a few sessions
5019618 we have to be realistic its going to be a tough constituency but well do our best
5019619 anwar has decided to take it to the people despite having the opportunity to clear his name using the processes available to him the accusations were made by his staff and not the government
5019620 if the leadership insists on contesting in permatang pauh i suggest we put an accounts supervisor or a local divisional member
5019621 its not about only winning or losing but bn must present a choice to the permatang pauh voters
5019622 if you ask me whether i am prepared to stand against anwar ibrahim i would say that i am ready and i would not reject such an offer victory or defeat is not the main thing more importantly it is opposing anwar as a team to uphold the truth
5019623 that is why i say do not talk of victory or defeat to me and do not scare me with the constituency of permatang pauh do not challenge me because i am a fighter and i will fight
5019624 but if there is a contest i will definitely defend my post
5019625 i have been a party member for 28 years and will always abide by the partys traditions
5019626 during the by election it is important for all parties to follow the orders given by the security authorities and ensure peace and stability
5019627 i think the reason they are having it on a weekday is to reduce the turnout
5019628 this is a deliberate action to inconvenience the voters we condemn the election commission for their decision
5019629 we fear there could be rigging we urge our supporters not to be complacent it is going to be a tough battle but we are confident of victory
5019630 just you listening to my story is enough for me
5019631 how did i lose to a girl in basketball that is just not right
5019632 if it has been a disaster then please provide the evidence
5019633 if the government thinks there has been any wrongdoing by the bar council there are other ways to arrest the problem
5019634 but im not in favour of using the isa against anyone
5019635 when i realised that other muslims would be attending the forum including pas and other islamic ngos i joined in
5019636 however my attendance was to ensure that pas supporters did not become unruly and cause any problems
5019637 they should have worded it better instead of calling it conversion to islam
5019638 i appreciate intellectual discussions but they should not make it public they should also invite more pas muftis and other islamic scholars
5019639 i have been asked to speak to him to give him notice to be fair since we are unable to contact him directly we will have to wait until we can do so
5019640 he zulkifli has to be clear that party policies and party decisions must be adhered to
5019641 we will have to first ask him to show cause and we will proceed from there
5019642 i think this the protest has taught us a lesson that some of our decisions have to be made well understood at the lower level of the party probably we didnt make it too clear
5019643 this is not a bn tradition but there is nothing to stop us from making this decision as it is not against bn constitution
5019644 there are a few opposition leaders who also contested on both parliamentary and state seats in the last general election
5019645 anwar may be good in one thing but not everything people need a service oriented mp
5019646 well liked beyond communal boundaries are enterprising and untainted clean personality
5019647 i am confident of winning even if not by an overwhelming majority
5019648 it is frightening if this becomes normal practice in future
5019649 as party members we must view this problem seriously and i regard umno now being in a danger zone if money politics continues unabated
5019650 ive received unofficial reports that it has become rampant at all levels and it is frightening if this becomes normal practice in future
5019651 it is sad if one day the people see this problem as synonymous with umno so the situation must be corrected before the next general election
5019652 one day after the election commission ec announced the date for the permatang pauh by election they charged me in court for consensual
5019653 now on the eve of nominations for this guy is swearing on the quran what is the motive for all this
5019654 we regret that unfortunate the fiercestamong them was someone known to be a lawyer and member of parliament who pretentiously claimed himself to be representing all muslims
5019655 we take seriously the rough action by a small band of the demonstrators who shouted rude and uncivilized language against some of the organizers and participants of the seminar
5019656 in view of the sensitive reactions and wrong perception among a section of the malay muslim population
5019657 we are in full support of holding inter religious dialogues that promote nderstanding rather than unilateral events that could create ethnic and religious dissension
5019658 it bar council should have acted wisely and speedily to announce that the seminar would be held behind closed door to avoid any unhealthy consequence on inter ethnic and inter religious relations in this country
5019659 it is a jihad because the individual should not be given the chance to destroy the countrys political stability and prosperity
5019660 if we allow him to lead the country he would lead us to destruction
5019661 another thing to increase workstation to server communication especially when accessing a database is to add the following exclusion to the standard shield adding the turns off network drive scanning on both the client and server and stops both workstation and server scanning the files when accessed this doesnt effect protection at all
5019662 the only proper tribute to omaghs dead ten years on must be that full cross border public inquiry
5019663 we call on public figures to back our call otherwise the system continues to fail everyone and should hold its head in shame
5019664 they will be judged not on their token gestures but on what they have or have not done to actually bring justice to omagh not wreathes
5019665 over the past ten years we have taken control of our own lives we could not allow terrorists to dictate to us we will continue to do what is right for us
5019666 if i was with you today i would ask you to do one thing and that is to look to the future a new generation is growing up in omagh and it is to them that we should be looking
5019667 i hope he intends to honor the pledge this time
5019668 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5019669 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5019670 russia will pay a price we will look seriously with our allies and bilaterally at the consequences of this russian action for russian integration
5019671 russia has already paid a price because its strategic objective of undermining the democracy of georgia of destroying its infrastructure is not going to succeed

5019675 i am very pleased to have finished second the rallye deutschland isnt my favourite asphalt event because its format doesnt let you settle into a real rhythm but it was very nice to be back on sealed surface stages we were a bit unsure about our set up to begin with but the work of the citroen technical team gave us a perfect car for saturday morning from that moment on we were able to up our pace and i had tremendous fun driving and running in second position our result gives citroen a one two finish and our overall points haul takes us to the top of the manufacturers standings so thats clearly a result ive moved up one place in the drivers points table too and we must now knuckle down to try to repeat the same sort of performance
5019676 its great to come here with very little testing and on new tyres and be able to finish on the podium it was always going to be a big challenge to fight for a win as the other drivers have been competing all year and have been testing so the result feels very good and for sure we have made improvements with the setup and learnt about the tyres so there are many positives the experience will help for the next two tarmac events we are doing
5019677 i was on the limit this morning to try to catch duval i had a big escape in ss16 i had a corner marked in my notes with a small cut but i took a big cut it was a high speed bend and the car was up on two wheels for a long time it was close on the third stage i saw i was three seconds down on duval at the third split section and decided to ease off and settle for fourth i didnt want to make any mistakes chasing third and risk losing what i had i set some great stage times on friday and with a bit more consistency i will be able to fight for a top place on this surface but i couldnt match the speed of the top two here but i feel my asphalt driving has improved and it was unfortunate i lost time with a puncture last night
5019678 we had no problems at all this weekend which is very good the very positive thing is that things have improved through the rally you know we started with okay speed and it got better through the rally you have to remember weve only done two days testing with the car so im really very happy with it i think weve found the direction we need to get the maximum from the car so its good
5019679 there were large gaps today so we werent taking any silly risks okay its not been a bad weekend and there are a lot of things we can take forward from it this morning was a little frustrating but we tried to find out some new things today that will help us continue fine tuning the car and improve our performance which is the main focus
5019680 the area has an ice base and the snow sometimes isnt stable it was a particularly good day up here this is just bad luck i presume
5019681 we dont know what the loss of control was from
5019682 everyone is very shocked this is something which is not common
5019683 im sure they will be comforting each other over the night
5019684 they put her straight into a stable next to two other horses
5019685 i said to the veterinary staff i dont know whats going on should she be going into a box with the other horses
5019686 oh for gods sake thats going to happen every now and again
5019687 thered be hundreds of syringes used every day there would be occasions where that would happen i do it myself for the volume of work thats done in the place the breakdowns are very minor as far as frequency is concerned
5019688 im sure we go to a lot of lengths that other people dont
5019689 ive got no problems with it i think the issue will be what standards are going to be applied across the industry in future in light of what weve had here theres never ever been this sort of thing before
5019690 this is an entirely new disease its a bit tough to be able to anticipate something like that
5019691 i do not consider that we will ever know conclusively either way
5019692 they were in adjoining stalls with just wire mesh between them if theres equipment used on an infected horse and then on a non infected horse that could potentially spread the virus
5019693 everyone in this district has been caught where theyve had to leave fruit on the trees you spend 12 months to get to the picking stage and all of a sudden youve lost it financially it is a huge blow
5019694 for too long farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
5019695 the scheme does not allow for there to be any reduction in wages in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available
5019696 the liberals had their chance this has been in the pipeline for years
5019697 there has been a desperate blaring need for seasonal staff in the horticultural industry
5019698 in swan hill if every unemployed person was employed in horticulture we would still be 300 jobs short

5019704 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight

5019714 can a person be both a follower of christ and a buddhist
5019715 can a person that adheres to the practices of the buddhist religion also follow the teachings of jesus christ
5019716 while one claims to be the only path to heaven is the other just a path to enlightenment or do they claim to be a path to salvation as well are enlightenment and salvation the same thing
5019717 as far as i can tell and i could be very wrong the buddha never claimed to be holy or claimed to be a god i dont think it was ever his intention to start a new religion
5019718 is it possible that buddhism should not be an ism at all that is should it merely be considered a personal philosophy of how to live your life
5019719 isnt it possible that one can follow a persons teachings and still hold true to their faith in god so isnt it possible to entertain the thought that a person can be a devout christian and also still follow the teachings of the buddha and vice versa

5019755 i had a little bit of hope inside of me
5019756 but seeing how beautifully she executed her routine i knew
5019757 after the all around i was excited to have made the floor finals and a bronze medal feels great
5019758 today i concentrated only on my moves not the medals
5019759 i felt that i had a very normal performance without surprises and that is why i got a silver medal
5019760 im disappointed especially since third place had a fall and i made both of mine
5019761 i cant change her score the judges made up their minds
5019762 i definitely had to pull myself together a little bit the last few days

5019801 team sports like cricket should not be included in the olympics olympics is a personal game where sportsman tries to excel within himself
5019802 it would be unfair to include cricket in the olympics as the players of other sports especially of individual events wait for the single day to happen and show their talents
5019803 hampers other sports but it is the governments who should take corrective measures to ensure that individual sports also get their due
5019804 can you create a market for cricket in places like the usa and china by playing at the olympics or do you first try to make the citizens of those countries more aware of the game so there is then a demand for it at olympic level
5019805 ive experience similar frustrations where exchanging a defective product simply results in a
5019806 mendis has really bowled well in the tests and his confidence must be sky high along with muralitharan they form a very potent attack but he is not unplayable and we are working on a gameplan to counter him during the one day series
5019807 we will try and play our natural game against him and see how it goes he does not bowl at 150 kmph so there is no reason to be frightened of him when murali was new to international cricket even he bothered many top batsmen and is still bothering them but with time batsmen learn more and adjust to the situations
5019808 i should say i am ready for the one day challenge i have been working hard in the nets i have also practiced some shots which i hope will help me counter the lankan spinners
5019809 i never thought id get the opportunity to be a favourite in an olympics again
5019810 just to come in as a favourite is an amazing experience to do it twice is just amazing and to win i cant say anymore
5019811 i knew that we had won it there was nobody coming back at that point
5019812 when we looked over i could see that our bow ball was definitely in front of the germans it was just making sure the judges were with us
5019813 after our first two races we kind of had a tendency of sort of getting caught in the last 500 so we made it our mission to really execute that last 500 and lay it all down on the line and i think we did that
5019814 coming into the last 500 we seemed to get our rhythm and iain said go for it we committed everything we had and went
5019815 we knew it was tight we really had no idea where we were when we started that sprint
5019816 it was exhausting there wasnt anything left in the end
5019817 it was a hard race i think the first half took a lot out of me for the second half i just couldnt be happier
5019818 it was really hard to compete on the last day
5019819 the team has been so supportive we really showed what we can do i think were really ecstatic to be canadians right now
5019820 i thought if i could get a quick enough shot it did not have to be hard i just wanted to get it on net and i managed to hit the goalies glove and it trickled in
5019821 and boxing with team mud happydaze can also be dangerous

5019826 he is also passionately a believer that the republican party must have a big tent
5019827 and i think frankly what he was just saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view ridge told foxs chris wallace today
5019828 hes not judgmental about me or my belief said ridge who also served as the first homeland security secretary under president bush and like mccain is a decorated war veteran and popular in a state where democrat barack obama apparently holds a narrow advantage over mccain
5019829 he just disagrees with me and theres no doubt in my mind no doubt whatsoever that there would be he would have a strong pro life administration no question about it

5019871 for me to write i need certain conditions one of quiet isolation not a city

5019873 hes a genuinely enthusiastic traveller with his feet on the ground
5019874 i realized how much was revealed everything is revealed its political realities economic realities its human condition how i felt about a place in the past and how i feel now
5019875 with that trip i felt such a continuous sense of discovery self discovery and discovery i thought maybe the ultimate in this would be to take the same trip again a trip that had meant a lot to me in 1973
5019876 the sort of place that gives rise to the notion that the earth is flat
5019877 a great meal a binge a visit from card players an intrigue a good nights sleep and strangers monologues framed like russian short stories

5019879 and theroux happened to be there at the start saying im opening up the door to this wanderlust in the american soul
5019880 i never saw myself as someone like faulkner who was writing about his home the people he knew at home his patch of landscape
5019881 i never really felt that writing about medford mass had a future
5019882 a kind of one upmanship on the way everyone else travels museums bad slums good solitude good companions bad airlines bad railways good it is a code and hes very strict about it and sometimes it seems so strict that im a little puzzled about the notion of purity it creates

5019887 otherwise why have i written as i have theres some emptiness or disorder that ones trying to fill or find an order in if you look into history you wont find many jolly well balanced people who were writers i mean look at them
5019888 in a way you cant be a writer unless you have sort of a personality problem balanced people dont become writers obviously balanced people become gardeners they raise happy families they go to work every day they smile they have noodle salad
5019889 i grew up in the 60s with the idea it was the most wonderful place in the world to live
5019890 one of the first mass cultural images of the south and of course its not the african american story at all its not the southern story at all
5019891 i felt like the lord brought us to shelby to do battle with our own pasts and with our own stories about our pasts
5019892 is a kind of a commitment that many generations of southerners black and white have made to try to have a multiracial democracy and try to redeem the u s constitution and the declaration of independence into more than words
5019893 who were caught between doing what was the right thing to do in terms of their faith and keeping bread on their table and having a job
5019894 that part of the story had a real wonderful resonance to me and i knew that having lived through that i could tell that story
5019895 in this story its human beings who are flawed imperfect and caught in a hard history and they are grappling to make sense of it and to fix what cannot be fixed
5019896 its not about saints and heroes but its about ordinary people like ourselves
5019897 we really have to tell the story and tell it in a way that is correct that is truthful and honest
5019898 hollywood has a way sometimes to kind of give people what they think people are ready for rather than what the truth is
5019899 it was never my intention to show the south at its best
5019900 i continually surprised myself in terms of the depth of the anger from the black community the depth of the frustration

5019912 in various parts of the second half of the games we do not boast of sporting events where we have the advantage
5019913 many of our teams are of inferior quality and our gold medal winning pace is expected to slow
5019914 you have to look at what china is doing with their sports program
5019915 relying on what countries traditional strengths are to predict results is something you cant do this year
5019916 if our athletes win the most gold medals that means our country is a great power
5019917 during the cold war medals were a big deal because we were fighting surrogate wars with our rivals
5019918 here theres not that kind of rivalry between the americans and the chinese which means the u s focus hasnt been as intense
5019919 theres been a lot of questions and concerns about our results but were watching this until the end
5019920 our focus now is on excellence were definitely here to win

5019932 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are unhappy with their lot some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
5019933 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women
5019934 im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5019935 its not councils view and its not mine its hard when youve got to defend something someone else has said were definitely appalled
5019936 its a public attack on women and a form of verbal and emotional abuse
5019937 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting if he wants to come and visit our service im more than happy to have a yarn to him about what hes saying
5019938 theyre very archaic comments i dont think he realises the repercussions of labelling women based solely on their looks
5019939 the article didnt paint a very good picture of the men here either but ive never been treated with anything but the utmost respect ive never walked into a club and been preyed upon theyve been lovely

5019965 i wanted to make limes a design experience however stripped of the associated design ideals of something unattainable i shifted the design focus to make the guest feel special yet not afraid of jumping into the bed like it was their own

5019981 there is absolutely no issue about mitt romneys religion i have never said that
5019982 i think when you look at mitt romney hes not in the totally uncomfortable column but hes not in the completely comfortable column

5019984 if tom ridge is on the ticket i will not be voting republican
5019985 they did alright in the early part of the game but once bolton got into their stride they showed stoke how to take free kicks and how to deal with them defensively they were the much better team
5019986 the first goal was quite sensational and im going to give steinsson the benefit of the doubt on the first game of the season
5019987 he was wide on the right and hit the ball with bend dip and everything he might have meant it as a cross but it hit the underside of the bar at the far post and went in the back of the net
5019988 it was quite sensational and from that moment stoke were never in it
5019989 i think they rely on set pieces and they forgot to play football they didnt build up through the middle and it was bolton all the way
5019990 after 15 or 20 minutes i was thinking the boy hadnt had a kick he was just running around and hardly got near the ball
5019991 but once he got into the game he was quite exceptional and he got a goal with a simple header into the bottom corner
5019992 it was in injury time when stoke got their goal a fantastic header from about 10 yards past jussi jaaskelainen who had very little to do
5019993 before that it could have been five or six and bolton played very well they only played one up front but it wasnt direct they got support to elmander and they played some really good football

5019996 all companies from major group to independent family concern point out that there is no market failure to justify state funded intervention into the regional and local media that the bbc would be merely replicating local news and related online services already provided by commercial local media and that the impact of such intervention would be hugely damaging to the local media sector at a critical time in its digital development thwarting the deeper broader and richer services which they would provide to their communities
5019997 the bbc should not be allowed to justify its aspirations for damaging expansion into an area already well served by the independent commercial media as a response to criticism of its own shortcomings
5019998 wir haben schon durch unsere k rpersprache gezeigt dass wir hier gewinnen wollen in der ersten halbzeit hatten wir probleme bei der spieler ffnung besonders ber die rechte seite waren wir eingebunden in der zweiten halbzeit sind uns die angriffe besser gelungen sehr gut hat mir gefallen dass wir die 2 1 f hrung clever verteidigt haben und auch bei kontersituationen lang in ballbesitz bleiben konnten das war in der vergangenen saison nicht immer der fall dieser sieg hat angesichts der st rke des gegners hohen stellenwert
