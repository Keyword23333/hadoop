8140000 we also hold syria and iran which directly support hezbollah responsible for this attack and for the ensuing violence
8140001 this attack demonstrates that hezbollahs continued impunity to arm itself and carry out operations from lebanese territory is
8140002 a shift of the shiite center of gravity from iran toward iraq has larger regional implications
8140003 there are local and international battles for basra locally it is between fadhila and other groups while regionally it is between iran and other forces like the british
8140004 we as fadhila we want to make our province our own region
8140005 we have two million people an airport a port and oil everything we need to be a state
8140006 authors of israel lobby paper get warm reception at military college
8140007 how to be nice to patients and be a human and doctor at the same time
8140008 it would take a hell on an offer to let him go but ive not heard anything from anyone and i dont envisage anything happening at this late stage
8140009 i have seen camara play against my teams in the past and score against us
8140010 i didnt even know what was happening with him in the summer but hes now here for another year and im sure hes got a part to play
8140011 he was one of the best when i was in russia
8140012 he is very quick technically he is very good he is good in one on one situations and he can make chances for other players
8140013 how he would do in england is difficult to know i didnt know how i was going to do in england
8140014 he is a good player and i would like to see him in england it would be good for him to come to see how good it is here compared to russia
8140015 we have not forgotten what we did last season but we know what we need to do again this year
8140016 we need to show we are a good team we want to have the same experiences and show we are still focussed and ready to win more trophies
8140017 they are owned by one of the biggest companies in the world so they have money which is important now
8140018 it means they can buy good players as well as finding their own which they do very well
8140019 the game will bring back a lot of memories for me and i am looking forward to it
8140020 if people live on debt we find ourselves with a problem
8140021 you cant put words to it the way i go back and think about it is if i would have had five minutes and known this fire was coming i would gone for the photos
8140022 theres no disappointment because i already feel like i lost everything literally everything the only things we saved were the items in our cars
8140023 knowing there was somebody in our neighborhood that didnt make it through this and realizing it could have been one of our kids just tears us up
8140024 it was the first game of the season so we had things to work out
8140025 and we still need to work on a few things but overall we played very well the base is there for a successful season
8140026 our serving was great in the preseason that was one of our weaknesses also i was very pleased with our chemistry zoe was awesome with an awesome attitude and shes only a junior
8140027 for a first game it was great we communicated pretty well and played our game
8140028 but in the third game tonight we did some good things so thats a positive about the way we are capable of playing
8140029 i just feel like were finding different ways to win ballgames
8140030 were kind of spoiled by now its been like that since april
8140031 i just want to get as deep in the game as i can
8140032 give the team a chance to win and put up as many zeros as i can
8140033 the way he takes the mound sets the tone for the game
8140034 playing defense behind him when hes pounding the strike zone like that it keeps you on your toes
8140035 i felt good for the first two innings and then i just got away from my game plan
8140036 i tried to battle through it but it just didnt work out a bounce here and a bounce there and that was it
8140037 just hopefully well continue to win the way we are as a team and finish strong
8140038 we could sit here for 20 minutes and name backups that ended up becoming stars and some guys who became hall of fame players
8140039 i think every backup in this league has that mentality even the coach has to see that if you dont think you can play you shouldnt be here
8140040 mike is a feisty guy and nick made a couple of plays and showed up on some things
8140041 i thought they held their own when you can show up like that you are taking advantage of those opportunities
8140042 obviously weve known they can play it was just good to see them come in step in and really help us out a lot
8140043 nickel dime quarter safety special teams in the box downfield whatever you need
8140044 its unfortunate that sean and brodney got hurt and we want them back as soon as possible but i promise you you wont see a drop off at all with me and nick out there
8140045 weve got a good rapport a good idea what each others thinking and how were going to be moving around back there
8140046 if something happens i dont want crennel to hesitate to put us in if theyre not ready to go i definitely will be
8140047 ontem naquele palco michelle quase n o era uma mulher negra ela estava muito distante da mulher negra estereotipada tinha uma imagem e uma presen a muito mais sutis do que no in cio da campanha

8140064 without these skills reading and writing they may not fully develop their abilities and optimally contribute to council activities especially when affairs of council are driven by agendas reports submitted and minutes
8140065 the 32 percent of councillors who require abet training should receive support as a matter of priority particularly as this report shows councillors with higher levels of education stand a better chance to serve in senior positions such as mayoral committees
8140066 some councillors are not comfortable in doing business in languages that are not their mother tongues
8140067 this study has helped us a lot together with the local government sector education and training authority seta and the department of provincial and local government in terms of service delivery
8140068 we need to take this illiteracy into consideration when we improve capacity for councillors for them to understand what government is trying to do when it comes to service delivery
8140069 we need to understand where we come from because some of our councillors were in the struggle and did not have a chance to go to school their political parties have deployed them to municipalities
8140070 the practical implications are that if so many of them do not have proper reading and writing skills then we can assume that councils end up approving budgets they cant interpret
8140071 people were rightly angry that they did not get a proper game it is difficult to put a finger on what went wrong we have a number of injuries but that is no excuse we were just not good enough on the field we have got to pick ourselves up and make sure our next performance is a lot better
8140072 when you play like we did today you kind of expect that reaction people pay a lot of money for their tickets
8140073 the test series win was the greatest high of my career while this loss has to be one of the lowest moments
8140074 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
8140075 i knew it was a robbery the first thought that came to mind was to save the money
8140076 in the midst of the commotion the robbers grabbed the money changers bags thinking that i had already placed the money bag onto the trolley
8140077 we live in a mud hut with only two rooms i dont know how were going to afford 10 children now
8140078 we were simply blessed by god that no complication happened if there had been a complication ghazala would have died
8140079 you cannot take this risk because of the complications to the mother and the babies
8140080 even if she had a period of infertility thats an indication that you should be careful when you stimulate
8140081 the important question to ask is why did she want to become pregnant after already having three children
8140082 its because she had three daughters and didnt have a boy in many parts of egypt if she doesnt have a boy its as if she didnt have children at all
8140083 i have never felt so much pain in my life the dog was attacking him and i was trying to release him and i could not
8140084 his mother died last year and i thought he was going to die in front of my eyes
8140085 we heard a dog barking a baby crying and someone screaming
8140086 when we looked out of the window we saw a dog on top of a baby biting at him
8140087 it was heartbreaking if only she had spoken to the victims she saw the child lying there bleeding but did not say anything
8140088 she did not bother to check whether the baby was alive or what had happened it was so sick
8140089 the baby was bitten to pieces but she did not do anything i was angry he was only a little baby
8140090 its going to take me a long time to recover
8140091 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8140092 there is still work to do on the bill clinton front
8140093 now john mccain is my colleague and my friend he has served our country with honor and courage but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8140094 i think things are actually progressing better than maybe some of us might have thought in terms of the relationship between the two of them
8140095 they havent known each other very well or very long and sen obama ran against his wife and theres still some bruised feelings but i think the president and sen obama are trying very hard to reach across that divide
8140096 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank an economy out of the doldrums and trying to help middle class families and it wouldnt make much sense for me to want to edit his remarks to prevent him from making a strong case about why we need fundamental economic change in this country
8140097 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8140098 there was some tension there it was a long battle and thats what politics is about
8140099 its a little bit like relationships you fight and you reconcile
8140100 you could argue that no one is ready to be president
8140101 sen clinton has pledged her whole support to my campaign as has president clinton
8140102 i think you will see during the course of this week that the democrat party is energized and determined to take the white house back
8140103 hell not only transform the nation hes going to transform the world
8140104 and im glad to be on the trip with him
8140105 we cant afford four more years of a foreign policy that has shredded our alliances and sacrifices our moral standing around the world
8140106 ladies and gentlemen thats the bad news but there is good news america we dont have to have four more years of george w bush and john mccain
8140107 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

8140111 man wird noch eine printversion drucken weil sie den werbekunden erm glicht die menschen weiterhin auf diesem weg zu erreichen allerdings nur sonntags oder zweimal in der woche
8140112 ive started a new project its big its like look at our line up and imagine something even bigger kind of big im directing it myself i cant mention it publicly yet when you find out what this is youll likely agree that i cant oversell this one
8140113 i immediately began looking at retail spaces in the city to get an idea of what was possible
8140114 i played a ton of arcade games as a kid thanks to generous parents and arcade games conveniently located any place we went
8140115 i was hooked from the very start and also have fond memories of legend of kage followed by black tiger a bit later on
8140116 arcade gaming died out in the u s for many reasons but i dont think any of them are the reasons most people think about
8140117 the number one reason it died here is because of our coinage system the japanese coin system is coincidentally perfectly made for arcade gaming with 50 yen and 100 yen denominations 50 cents 1 dollar
8140118 ultimately i dont think its a matter of japanese people being any more into gaming than americans
8140119 arcades have been successfully marketed in japan and adapted through an era of change the u s operators just gave up
8140120 japan is a culture built around easy transportation in metro areas and there is always an arcade close by if youre in the city
8140121 it was dirty didnt always smell great and generally looked like it was about to fall apart however this was the kind of place you could go and make life long friends and the arcade machines were always in perfect shape the regulars diligently attended almost every day myself included when i lived there in 2005
8140122 i want to bring back that feature which is long lost in most of the arcades still standing in the u s today
8140123 the feeling that the other people in the room actually play video games and enjoy them as much as you do
8140124 local businesses in austin have been extremely supportive and helped to make sure everyone knows about us
8140125 white race is the ultimate one and colored are evil
8140126 my music is so great that i can pleasure the female of the species without ever meeting them power also im a director
8140127 whoever observes fasts during the month of ramadhan out of sincere faith and hoping to attain allahs rewards then
8140128 o allah make us and all muslims of those who fast and stand in prayer during the month of ramadhan based on belief and truly seeking your reward so that we are forgiven our past and future sins
8140129 cannot save your message in draft folder cannot open the temporary folder please check permission of temporary folder
8140130 that at first glance seemed only mildly entertaining and mostly innocuous
8140131 this was a mild shake of the tree we looked under a few rocks and look what we found
8140132 this same logic the sporting giants program logic could apply to most human endeavors because most people dont know what theyre good at
8140133 parents that do home schooling need to keep attendance records
8140134 theres criteria they have to follow and many of them are not aware of that
8140135 homeschoolers need only send in a letter with this inforamtion students in attendance at the school during the first two weeks of school
8140136 all provate and parochial schools shall at all times be open to inspection by directors of pupil personnel and officials of the department of education section 159 040
8140137 intensive focus on attendance is not motivated by the loss of funds due to absenteeism according to compton
8140138 the end of year eoy average daily attendance ada will determine the district budget for 2008 2009
8140139 do not let the sun go down on your wrath
8140140 the idea that its helpful for couples to air their grievances in the heat of the moment is probably one of the most dangerous marriage myths out there
8140141 often nothing gets resolved the partners just get more and more furious
8140142 no matter what if youre angry if hes angry or if youre both exhausted kiss good night for six seconds
8140143 sure sometimes youll be so mad or tired that the kiss will last for six nanoseconds but it will remind you of your enduring affection and besides long kisses often lead to something even better than conversation
8140144 take turns telling each other something about your marriage or your partner that you appreciated that week and then afterward each of you gets to bring up one issue
8140145 couples who meet through matchmaking services which frequently try to pair singles according to hundreds of points of compatibility would have a better chance of staying married than those who meet randomly they dont
8140146 we need to give long term partners credit for their marriages
8140147 these couples have probably worked their way through hundreds of disagreements illnesses financial problems kids issues maybe even an affair they survive because they understand that they are a team and they work to find ways to come together whether in a crisis or in good times
8140148 if you sprayed fixative on people during their wedding ceremony
8140149 they find a sexual style that makes them both happy
8140150 i cant remember the last time we made love with the lights on can you
8140151 with the kids out of the house marriages can bloom when there is a sense of shared purpose
8140152 some couples may have let that feeling of togetherness die
8140153 then its not the kids leaving the nest that somehow makes their marriages seem empty theyve already been empty a long time and when the children leave home the couple finally notices
8140154 marital satisfaction actually goes up once the kids are gone
8140155 and now you have the opportunity to decide what to do next will you get more involved in town politics learn to tango go out to dinner more often
8140156 sex is like a game of card if you dont have a good partner you better have a good hand
8140157 when the republicans get started next week at their convention theyre going to let the attacks loose in prime time right out of the chute
8140158 id never advocate using untruths or distortions but we ought to be going at them blow for blow right here on this floor and real soon
8140159 lets give people a reason to be for us rather than just telling them not to be for the other guy
8140160 a lot of people dont feel like they really know obama yet
8140161 i think michelle obama did a pretty good job of helping them get to know him and she did that in a very positive way that was very well received
8140162 i think well take it to mccain id expect thats what joe biden will do when its his turn to speak
8140163 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8140164 republicans have no qualms about using swift boat ads willie horton and just about everything else while we just sit back
8140165 i think john kerry made a big mistake when he didnt hit back in 2004 were in here preaching to the choir when we ought to be preaching to the folks at home watching this on tv
8140166 you have mixed news here mirroring the mixed news in the economy last year
8140167 but i think it is quite reasonable to say 2007 was a peak year and still median income is slightly below the 2000 level poverty is higher and child poverty is way up you have a cycle here that was very sluggish
8140168 if we continue to turn a blind eye to the growing income gap between the very rich and the rest of us well find ourselves in a country with no middle class
8140169 bridging our countrys troubling income gap starts with universal health care because working families will never get ahead if they continue to be held back by medical bills and insurance premiums they cant afford to pay
8140170 programs like schip and medicaid are lifelines for providing americans with the health care they need especially during times when the economy is soft and more people feel vulnerable to losing employer sponsored health insurance
8140171 unfortunately were still seeing an unraveling of the private insurance system
8140172 i think things are actually progressing better than maybe some of us might have thought in terms of the relationship between the two of them
8140173 they havent known each other very well or very long and sen obama ran against his wife and theres still some bruised feelings but i think the president and sen obama are trying very hard to reach across that divide
8140174 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank an economy out of the doldrums and trying to help middle class families and it wouldnt make much sense for me to want to edit his remarks to prevent him from making a strong case about why we need fundamental economic change in this country
8140175 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president

8140177 its a little bit like relationships you fight and you reconcile
8140178 you could argue that no one is ready to be president
8140179 sen clinton has pledged her whole support to my campaign as has president clinton
8140180 i think you will see during the course of this week that the democrat party is energized and determined to take the white house back

8140182 and im glad to be on the trip with him
8140183 we cant afford four more years of a foreign policy that has shredded our alliances and sacrifices our moral standing around the world
8140184 ladies and gentlemen thats the bad news but there is good news america we dont have to have four more years of george w bush and john mccain
8140185 for me its all about legacy i wish that there were 48 hours in each day so that i had the stamina and time to expedite all of my ideas accordingly i receive credit for my accomplishments but i tend to think that im just getting started i prefer to move under the radar i stay away from negativity and never stop for anyone in my heart im a product of the culture im not fabricated or premeditated ive been through a lot if i was to ever slow down it would be purely by choice while other individuals are talking drinking smoking or focusing on women im in my own space striving towards a higher plateau we must preserve our culture as djs entertainers enthusiasts purists supporters and so forth actions speak louder than words the time is now
8140186 while the benefits of these increased coal prices did have a positive impact on 2007 08 revenues primarily the past few months the benefits are anticipated to accrue substantially in 2008 09 and beyond chief executive rob lord said in a statement
8140187 both demand and prices for coal are likely to stay strong and within this context i am confident we will be able to further increase our revenues and profitability in the coming years mr lord said
8140188 q12 if you can change into another member for a day who would it be why thirtysixpointfivedegrees
8140189 i say to people do people actually live like this you go to bed when you like you get up in the morning and then you have breakfast then you read and go for a walk and come back and read some more
8140190 then you put the fire on sit in front of it and watch the tv i thought if this is the way some people live or how they do when theyre sick then im happy to be sick forever it becomes addictive
8140191 i suppose its a little slower than i thought but as the doctor said to me the other day it wasnt an operation it was an excavation
8140192 i cant expect to be up and doing marathons straight away and its only five weeks since the operation im managing well and they seemed to have got all the cancer
8140193 im doing some tests this week ive got a bit of soreness because i had robotic surgery which is fairly invasive
8140194 the doctor said of the area that is sore thats where i went after you so i suppose i have to be prepared to pay a bit of a price but im doing all right
8140195 there are side affects you have to deal with but thats the choice the choice is between vanity and life and i chose life
8140196 but i dont want to go into the bit to do ive had to do with him
8140197 but ive interviewed little matthew and i said at the time when they were talking about gold medals for everybody else that this was the fellow that could really upset the apple cart
8140198 he had been to hell and back on many occasions and much has been made of him leaving the sport and all ill say to you is i can assure you it wasnt a voluntary thing and there were very significant pressure from administrators in relation to this young fellow
8140199 i think for him to know hes come out of the olympic games with the greatest dive in the history of the olympic movement gives him a permanent place in the history of the olympic games
8140200 this election is not about liberal versus conservative or right versus left its about the future versus the past
8140201 i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past
8140202 there is only one question in this race which candidate offers the change we need to restore the promise of america
8140203 in 2007 he voted with the bush administration 95 percent of the time only one candidate in the race offers the change we need to restore the promise of america a person of integrity honesty and love for his country barack obama
8140204 hopefully out of this there will be hundreds of women who will take a stand and say yes i can
8140205 i just think thats what our policy is all about inclusion and honoring that inclusion
8140206 and having the leaders of our party step up to the plate and pave that road for other women to get to the top and be in public service and be in public life i just think its a tremendous tribute
8140207 teddy intends to be back in the senate in january
8140208 he intends to continue fighting the battles that hes fighting particularly for universal healthcare he wants to leave that as his legacy
8140209 theyre having a tough time because of rising fuel prices because of the same things that are creating a tough time for individual families that are trying to fill up their gas tank or buy groceries
8140210 he was a picture of confidence but in some ways confidence itself and confidence in ones country are not the same
8140211 i can tell you that i thought joe biden as a selection for barack obama was designed of course to bring foreign policy experience to barack obamas team and his ticket i think it brings experience but if you look at joe bidens record with some 30 years in foreign policy experience theres about 30 years of being generally being wrong on foreign policy issues
8140212 unlike senator clinton i have no kind of ambiguity about my candidate
8140213 she said her candidate is unprepared to be president i announced when i was running that if i wasnt running i would support john mccain so im very enthusiastic
8140214 even though many of us think of labor day weekend as the end of summer mosquitoes will be around until a hard frost
8140215 we are still seeing a lot of virus around in every part of the state kids will soon be involved in after school activities during the time of day when mosquitoes are most active so we want parents and schools to remind young people to cover up and use bug spray to help prevent mosquito bites

8140217 nel corso degli ultimi tre anni spiega la ricerca con riferimento a un paniere di prodotti orticoli costruito in modo omogeneo la differenza tra il prezzo alla produzione e quello allingrosso risulta in italia superiore al 100 contro un valore mediamente del 60 in spagna e in francia
8140218 in questa fase per litalia si legge nello studio utilizzando i dati dellistituto di servizi per il mercato agricolo alimentare ismea si osserva un incremento medio di prezzo superiore al 50 nel complesso dal produttore al consumatore il ricarico totale del comparto e mediamente del 200
8140219 nel caso di filiere cortissime passaggio diretto dal produttore al venditore
8140220 prossimo al 300 nei casi in cui siano presenti 3 o 4 intermediari oltre al produttore e al distributore finale
8140221 a causa dellelevata stagionalit e deperibilit dei prodotti o a fronte di una scarsa organizzazione della produzione agricola
8140222 rappresentata in circa il 60 dei casi da un solo intermediario coincidente di norma con il mercato allingrosso
8140223 si caratterizza ancora per la presenza di una moltitudine di strutture di piccola dimensione a fronte dei 19 mercati allingrosso esistenti in francia e dei 23 in spagna in italia sono presenti quasi 150 strutture
8140224 una dimensione pari a meno di un quinto di quella delle realt minori in francia e spagna
8140225 poco meno della met delle strutture italiane risale agli anni sessanta e settanta e quasi un terzo e antecedente alla seconda guerra mondiale
8140226 il complesso dei mercati allingrosso si presenta insufficiente a trattare unofferta agricola rilevante ridistribuendola verso altri mercati di sbocco
8140227 iniziato in italia in ritardo rispetto agli altri paesi europei
8140228 manca un sistema informatico adeguato sia per la rilevazione dei prezzi sia per garantire la tracciabilit dei prodotti
8140229 che consente di accrescere il grado di concorrenza tra gli operatori oltre a offrire un maggior servizio allutenza

8140270 ive admired david loiseau from afar hes one of the first fighters i took note of in the ufc and im honored to fight him
8140271 hes more of an all out striker and hes got a lot of tricks on the ground but i feel my straight forward style will kind of blast through that
8140272 to kick you have to be on one leg and takedowns are kind of my thing so im going to capitalize on that as much as possible

8140279 that process is in line with the procedures established by the previous government on the consideration of visa applicants
8140280 mr broadus has not been granted a visa there are further steps required beyond character assessment before a visa is granted
8140281 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus
8140282 community complaints have no effect on the grant or otherwise of a visa each application is assessed individually on its merits
8140283 as a result of public concern and interest the department has decided that in fact we will be undertaking a more thorough assessment of mr broadus character however the decision on the granting or refusal of a visa application is made on the individual merit of the case consistent with the legal criteria for the class of the visa

8140295 if they think its a failure they will say it needs more money or they will say its a success so it needs more money
8140296 no matter how the performance is the answer from a year from now will be it needs more money and to be expanded

8140529 arthur rimbaud and schiele were comparable geniuses and schiele was in a way un vilain bonhomme as rimbaud and his drinking buddies called themselves schieles rebelliousness was part of the overall secessionist spirit that possessed twentieth century artists impatient for official academic art to be junked and modernism to begin

8140533 she understands that the unity of this party is tantamount to our success

8140537 not everyone can get over hillary but people are moving on
8140538 i think when they heard hillary tonight they will go with obama

8140554 we were very lucky that the pilots skill allowed him to land the aircraft where he did

8140573 an appropriate comparison must be made when comparing iburst wimax to that of telkoms offering when compared to a similar telkom broadband offering is slightly more expensive the difference is due to the symmetrical access i e same upload and download speeds designed to support increasing upload speed requirements by smes to support hosted applications
8140574 when compared with telkoms dedicated internet access and other layer 3 services pricing is similar and in some instances less expensive according to telkoms call centre they only offer wimax in instances where adsl cannot be offered to customers that have applied for an adsl line it is not freely available as a product option
8140575 it has the added convenience of being a one step ordering process that includes bandwidth and internet access the only prerequisites for service subscription are credit vetting and that the installation location falls within the coverage area
8140576 customers are required to have a telkom line installed before they can subscribe to the service
8140577 of particular note was the groups ability to manage its expenses which grew at an inflation beating seven percent
8140578 the discussions with vodafone are still ongoing and shareholders are therefore advised to continue to exercise caution when dealing in telkom securities until a further announcement is made

8140603 so we decided not to rush it there was no point the film has 8 9 new young actors all straight from the streets and trained by my director joy augustine through intense workshops the film needs rigorous promotion because its got no stars but every one of those 8 9 faces is a potential star

8140631 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8140632 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8140633 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8140634 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8140635 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8140636 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8140637 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8140638 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8140639 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8140640 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8140641 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

8140650 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8140651 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8140652 when i spoke to priya a week ago she claimed that her parents were planning to cancel our engagement and get her married to a rich man later my mother went to the girls house to talk about the issue but the latters family members abused her in filthy language priyas father is a policeman and he threatened my mother with dire consequences
8140653 later we started talking to each other over the phone two years ago we met in person and fell in love soon we began meeting at a particular place in the city daily after work we decided to marry only after getting the approval for both our families and soon informed them about our proposal subsequently the engagement was conducted
8140654 after the engagement i couldnt meet priya regularly but we maintained contacts over the phone however i was not able to talk to her for the past one month i couldnt meet her in person too as i was busy with my work when i did manage to get her on the phone a week ago she told me in a hushed tone that her parents were planning to marry her off to another person after cancelling our engagement
8140655 barack obama got a special deal from a convicted felon
8140656 if we don t get a favourable response we will stop haircuts and shaves of politicians or peoples representatives
8140657 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8140658 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8140659 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8140660 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8140661 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8140662 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8140663 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8140664 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8140665 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8140666 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8140667 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8140668 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8140669 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8140670 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8140671 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8140672 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8140673 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8140674 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8140675 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8140676 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8140677 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8140678 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8140679 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8140680 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8140681 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8140682 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8140683 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8140684 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8140685 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8140686 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8140687 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8140688 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8140689 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8140690 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8140691 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8140692 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8140693 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8140694 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8140695 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8140696 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8140697 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8140698 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8140699 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8140700 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8140701 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8140702 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8140703 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8140704 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8140705 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8140706 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8140707 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8140708 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8140709 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8140710 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8140800 i mean i was real excited to go back up to oregon and play but as a team especially me personally we didnt execute well said marecic
8140801 we didnt get the job done we kind of got it handed to us were really trying to take a step forward and learn from it and come back strong this year
8140802 oh they were very good they had a great defensive scheme very confusing at times he said
8140803 im sure they have a bunch of great athletes great guys who are going to step up he said

8140812 i think the people of assam cannot ask for anything more as all these world class institutes could go a long way in developing the state in terms of human resource development
8140813 the package is really noteworthy as the prime minister instead of just doling out cash incentives decided to go for specified projects and that too with a vision aimed at developing the skills of local youths by way of setting up several top notch educational facilities
8140814 i have never come across a prime minister like manmohan singh who has generously agreed to all our proposals this shows how sincere and committed the prime minister is to the welfare and development of the state
8140815 i think all these time bound projects would help develop assam by leaps and bounds

8140832 he declared that the central government would continue to make all possible efforts for the development of the people of the northeast and that resources would not be allowed to become a constraint
8140833 as requested by the chief minister of assam the central share in important schemes for rural water supply and rural sanitation has been enhanced to 90 percent for assam as also the other northeastern states
8140834 i wanted to have a cheque book issued for my account for which the bank asked me to maintain a minimum amount of rs 1 000 in my account for that i had gone to the bank to deposit rs 400
8140835 i took the passbook and returned home without checking the fresh entries next day i went to the bank again to deposit rs 100 in my account to take the figure to rs 1 000 but the bank asked me to withdraw rs 100 which i could not understand
8140836 two days later when i saw my pass book i was at first taken aback to see rs 98 57 60 24 253 as balance in my account i was shocked and my mind went numb for a moment so much money all in two days how could it be i thought i immediately told my father about it he too was shocked

8140842 this move into fashion is in broader synergy with the groups long term strategies and objectives we believe fashion especially in the area of couture and bridal wear is a central interest in the lives of a great proportion of indians we would like to be part of ensuring that indias fashion heritage is preserved and nurtured our core belief at hdil is in creating value and with hdil india couture week we would like to create value for the indian fashion industry
8140843 it s probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their
8140844 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8140845 the brain areas that are responsible for language in an adult do not
8140846 i think we did a hell of a job of putting america back where its supposed to be which is at the top of the world
8140847 if it wasnt for the determination and willpower we had we wouldnt be back on top of the world which is where we are
8140848 if ginobili hadnt gotten hurt or if calderon had played argentina or spain probably would have beat them
8140849 this is about more than a gold medal this is about true redemption
8140850 with the global credit crunch and bear market entering its second year and with little end in sight we believe this is placing ongoing pressure on macquaries businesses and outlook ubs analyst jonathan mott said in a note to clients

8140862 choice is concerned about the level of access that pharmaceutical company drug representatives have to gps relative to independent sources of information
8140863 what 60 per cent of surveyed gps are telling us is that there arent enough sources of independent information available for them to be able to keep abreast of new drugs without receiving visits from multiple pharma company drugs reps
8140864 doctors value interactions with representatives of the pharmaceutical industry and the opportunity for questions and discussion they present
8140865 namun kami telah menyiapkan dua buah water canon untuk pengamanan istana
8140866 kami memang datang ke sini dengan terlebih dulu berkoordinasi dengan fpi
8140867 amerika serikat di bawah obama akan berkurang kemakmurannya dan semakin tidak aman
8140868 barack obama memang menari dan merupakan orang baik dengan keluarga yang menyenangkan tetapi ia belum siap menjadi presiden
8140869 saya tidak sedang mempromosikan kualifikasi saya atau menyembunyikan kelemahan saya agar bisa ikut mccain
8140870 this is something i said from the beginning was going to happen and now its become reality
8140871 we have to reduce our spending because we have less money to spend
8140872 regardless of whether or not cases are prosecuted or whether these individuals are held in the jail we have an obligation as a police department to arrest those individuals who are committing crimes in the community and were going to continue to do so
8140873 if we have to rearrest those same individuals who are being released then were going to do that
8140874 this has been the dream of coaches pe teachers and students for a long time
8140875 we retained portions of its original interior what we wanted to show today is that the interior reflects the new met a new museum a full 21st century state of the art museum
8140876 i think as a city the benefit is that youre going to have a vibrant cultural arts district a place people can entertain themselves look at art the culture the museums and an urban center where people can live work and play
8140877 where else would you think about the citys future and get a paycheck every two weeks
8140878 why are we asking for prices and records from these companies
8140879 theres some good in this ordinance and i do encourage recycling but i cant support this there are just too many questions about its impact on private business
8140880 a common element with the improvements will be eliminating the ability for cars or pedestrians to bypass crossing arms
8140881 if there are two arms at a crossing now it will likely be increased to four and there will be fences to keep pedestrians from crossing in some areas
8140882 i think thats one of the reasons the hospital was so happy to help us on this project
8140883 i actually get a lot of calls about the railroad noise
8140884 weve talked about it and last year we put money aside for the project im happy were going to get started now
8140885 alasannya dalam undang undang penyampaian unjuk rasa pendemo harus berjarak minimal 100 meter dari istana negara
8140886 we were scoring lots of goals in pre season and the team was improving it was really pleasing
8140887 i thought we were in a good moment but we didnt play well in our last three games that was clear
8140888 if you are asking me if i am considering defeat then the answer is no
8140889 all we have is data from bpom research conducted this april do you want us to make public something that has already been announced
8140890 that process is in line with the procedures established by the previous government on the consideration of visa applicants
8140891 mr broadus has not been granted a visa there are further steps required beyond character assessment before a visa is granted
8140892 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus
8140893 she exhibited all the reasons why she should be president
8140894 she showed us a good reason why we have to unite
8140895 she asked the right questions and answered them the way they needed to be answered
8140896 i think her job was to show why shes for obama and why we should support him
8140897 she said she felt as if she got her marching orders
8140898 hes a democrat too and had to beat other people
8140899 she could have had a speech that repeated his name again and again i think she was talking more about herself and preparing for 2012
8140900 she was more passionate about obama than ive seen her before
8140901 there is more infrastructure set up here on the gold coast and adelaide is a bit dead theres nothing really happening down there
8140902 its also really cold in winter and really hot in summer i remember having to take cold showers in the middle of the night because it was so hot
8140903 i have clothing i have a book i have a pencil
8140904 hay insuficiente evidencia de que hubiera alg n tipo de plan o amenaza pero nos mantendremos abiertos al investigar
8140905 la evidencia es insuficiente para representar en este momento una real amenaza complot o conspiraci n contra el senador obama
8140906 dispararle a obama desde una alta posici n estrat gica con un rifle desde una distancia de 750 metros
8140907 siempre existen temores de algo como esto pero con estas redadas ahora sabemos que se trata de algo real
8140908 estas redadas han subrayado las dificultades que enfrentan las poblaciones en esta situaci n
8140909 no estoy segura que todas esas poblaciones tengan la capacidad de lidiar y proporcionar una intervenci n en pocas de crisis
8140910 es una comunidad diferente que cuando era ni o eso hay que darlo por seguro
8140911 tenemos tolerancia cero para emplear a trabajadores que no est n autorizados a trabajar en estados unidos
8140912 usted puede observar que las personas est n en general m s asustadas
8140913 algunos de ellos ni siquiera se animan a salir a la calle como hac an antes
8140914 ser un duro golpe para nuestra comunidad tanto a nivel cultural como econ mico
8140915 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
8140916 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
8140917 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
8140918 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
8140919 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
8140920 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
8140921 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
8140922 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
8140923 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
8140924 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
8140925 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
8140926 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
8140927 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
8140928 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
8140929 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
8140930 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
8140931 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
8140932 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
8140933 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
8140934 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
8140935 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
8140936 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
8140937 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
8140938 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
8140939 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
8140940 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
8140941 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
8140942 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
8140943 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
8140944 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
8140945 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
8140946 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
8140947 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
8140948 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
8140949 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
8140950 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
8140951 ive had a chance to play and be healthy so im excited to be here
8140952 im motivated to do very well here and for the rest of the season
8140953 i wish i could play normal matches and enjoy tennis sometimes
8140954 i think at the moment its a lot to ask for
8140955 there are some very specific groups including hispanic voters where she did very well and obama has a lot of work to do to convince these people they ought to stay with him
8140956 i always say to myself what is the most important thing we can think about at this extraordinary moment
8140957 using compressed air it takes only five minutes to inflate
8140958 comes complete with an altar an apse and a confessional
8140959 much like menudo does or the blue man group i was going to hand the band over to this younger generation of clayton worbeck keyboards kind of franchise it out i think that these three knuckleheads capture the true essence and spirit of being a revolting cock if you will but this album turned out so damned good i think im going to stick around for a while revco album ive ever done
8140960 as a matter of fact i think this is the best album
8140961 the challenge will be coming up with a name for the already took all of the revco appropriate tour names such as for ministry well probably have a contest on the jourgensen in the studio on his sophomore release with the is busy producing revco tv a direct to internet weekly youtube tv broadcast to be implemented in the fall revco tracks in studio footage and will parlay all the revco antics as the band records and prepares for its world tour retains the unmistakable revco industrial dance metal sound and sees worbeck let first wave glam rock seep into their already rich sound case in point the soon to be quirky anthem and first single from the album ministrys 2008 c u latour
8140962 josh recorded a lot of these vocals in his apartment really thin walls with no soundproofing
8140963 being friends and associates of indie recordings for years we are firmly sure that this cooperation will bring

8140970 the sheer fact that you have to cut away from your family the outside world let go of your cell phones cannot get any worse than that
8140971 i was surprised and shocked that she took up the offer i met her for the first time ever since after the big brother show on the stage when i introduced her and from her sheer demeanour i realised that she was so warm to me the aggressive side to her had totally vanished
8140972 you have to go there without a mask and just be yourself
8140973 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8140974 this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together
8140975 liberdade para os presos en folga de fame en quatre camins no es el primer sabotaje ferroviario desde el inicio de la huelga prometemos que tampoco ser el ltimo no os dejaremos solos libertad o muerte
8140976 our evidence indicates the earliest inhabitants of palau were of normal stature and it counters the evidence that berger et al presented in their paper indicating there was a reduced stature population in early palau
8140977 our research from whole bones and whole skeletons indicates that the earliest individuals in palau were of normal stature but gracile in other words they were thin
8140978 i think bergers primary mistakes were his not understanding the variation in the skeletal population in which he was working
8140979 the troops engaged the militants with small arms machine guns and close air support killing more than a dozen militants
8140980 we have developed a method that enables us to visualise fingerprints even after the print itself has been removed we conducted a study into the way fingerprints can corrode metal surfaces
8140981 for the first time we can get prints from people who handled a cartridge before it was fired wiping it down washing it in hot soapy water makes no difference and the heat of the shot helps the process we use
8140982 the procedure works by applying an electric charge to a metal say a gun or bullet which has been coated in a fine conducting powder similar to that used in photocopiers
8140983 even if the fingerprint has been washed off it leaves a slight corrosion on the metal and this attracts the powder when the charge is applied so showing up a residual fingerprint
8140984 the technique works on everything from bullet casings to machine guns even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun
8140985 whenever i do the scene i get emotional about my mother whom i lost last year
8140986 today at 4 am more than 250 police forces and 150 villagers have resumed their search in the mountains and we hope we can find him
8140987 power in a democracy flows from ballots and not bullets he added that full potential of this region is still unexplored
8140988 we need a large number of nurses to support our healthcare institutions the women of the north east are well educated and progressive in outlook i have no doubt that given the right opportunities we will see large numbers of lady doctors and nurses from the north east in different hospitals and health care institutions of the country

8141005 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8141006 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership

8141017 we should disclose that the band has been going through some hard times recently both as a band and as individuals
8141018 working on the new record was the final breaking point for an already unstable band
8141019 there is still a lot of uncertainty on the politicalfront people just want to get out of the market
8141020 i wouldnt be surprised if the u s solar market passeseuropes in a few years
8141021 in japan growth will be a little slower without something like tariff system
8141022 depending on the size of the subsidies the domestic marketmight just grow by a double digit percentage in three to fouryears
8141023 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point wemay need to tap into short term lines of credit with thetreasury for working capital not to cover our losses
8141024 aqui s tem mulher bruta e isso eu posso provar
8141025 my eyes just rolled down the street from the amount of sarcasm currently seeping from this blog post
8141026 it allows west school service personnel association to maintain our independence and control our own destiny but at the same time it provides for a benefits and service for our members
8141027 when we go to the legislature when we go to the school boards it just means that as a unified voice we will be much more effective
8141028 together we can turn the page on november 4 by voting for the one candidate who can bring us the change we need barack obama
8141029 they do the heavy lifting in the economy they mine the coal make the stills and work the assembly lines that make our industrys tick
8141030 theyre experience and knowledge has earned each of them a ph d in life
8141031 ive seen teams play like this when theyre 30 games out
8141032 i see where his emotions are hes frustrated by it just like a lot of the players
8141033 im not frustrated i dont like losing youve got to treat every game like its a playoff game
8141034 when youre three games out with 30 games to go every game should be like a playoff game thats all im saying
8141035 i dont think theres any prototypical passionate team where youll have guys hanging from lockers
8141036 to me this game is more about your determination than showing somebody what they think it should look like
8141037 seniors have a lot of choice with medicare part d
8141038 they actually can pick a plan that really best meets their needs
8141039 unlike the current medicare part d program the meds act works to guarantee that all americas seniors are provided with the medication that they require
8141040 with the ever growing cost of prescription medications the meds act works to ensure that no senior is forced to skip doses or go without because of the high cost of their prescriptions
8141041 if i turn 65 and im not actually on any drugs i might go ahead and sign up and be part of the risk pool
8141042 if i wait until im 75 and im on 10 other drugs it would be much more costly for the people enrolled as well as tax payers so the government wants to create the incentive for you to be in the risk pool the entire time in fact a lot of people might be better off waiting
8141043 it will basically calculate for them a list in descending order of the plans that are the best choice for them
8141044 so thats been in place for a couple years now and every year we actually improve the information on it
8141045 let your doctor know that you have a formulary plan for a drug and that he or she finds the appropriate drug for your care
8141046 a lot of companies are making their products difficult to split
8141047 what weve heard sounds very interesting but there are a lot of open questions
8141048 an alternative that has the potential to lower prices who knows if it will thats one of the questions is something were interested in exploring
8141049 we recognize that at some point its going to become uneconomical for the petroleum industry to continue making leaded avgas and there needs to be an alternative
8141050 we have the only resulting success when it comes to matching or exceeding petroleum in a high octane aviation fuel
8141051 if a company hopes to succeed it all depends on the price what the current market price is and what it costs to produce
8141052 what has to happen is the person who wants to provide the fuel needs to present a technical case for their fuel which means they need to demonstrate that their product matches the petroleum product already in the field
8141053 were hoping we can do that in tampa in december during the full meeting of the board
8141054 but they do have such a long road to go
8141055 ive not heard anything from our supplier about such a thing or read about it in the trade journals but it certainly sounds like something i want to look into
8141056 id be for anything that can benefit the environment and cut costs if possible
8141057 a lot of people today feel that the office holders too often ignore the public point of view
8141058 indeed there may be some that are even contemptuous of the public point of view
8141059 when he walked in he said whats your name to me
8141060 its a good safety valve to have when things go askew in government
8141061 and i think that attitude is why a convention is superior to just relying on the same old people in springfield that we have today
8141062 theres just not agreement that a constitutional convention would be productive or constructive given the political climate that we currently have
8141063 this is a constitution youre talking about changing its not just a statutory compendium so maybe it should take a little more time
8141064 i would not want to expose our constitution to the current political winds that are blowing right now
8141065 the opponents of a con con to me theyve got to trust democracy they basically make an argument that the status quo is acceptable and i think thats where their weakest position is

8141070 p rez yoma rechaz duramente el ultim tum de agricultores de la araucan a
8141071 agricultores de temuco dieron 10 d as a p rez yoma para visitar la zona
8141072 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8141073 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8141074 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
8141075 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche

8141077 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8141078 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
8141079 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
8141080 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8141081 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8141082 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8141083 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8141084 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8141085 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8141086 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8141087 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8141088 nosotros hemos repudiado tremendamente este acto y vamos a aplicar con rigor la ley pero tambi n con la sensatez de no prejuzgar de no partir haciendo cosas locas por manos individuales sino que respetando la institucionalidad que este pa s tiene

8141093 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8141094 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8141095 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8141096 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8141097 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8141098 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
8141099 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo

8141102 el ministerio del interior presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal
8141103 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

8141121 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8141141 menjelang olimpiade banyak wanita yang ingin mengenakan busana dari negaranya sendiri bahkan koleksi ini dengan mudah telah cepat terjual di pasaran koleksi ini tidak hanya dijual di indonesia saja tetapi juga di luar negeri juga
8141142 the sounds of gunshots were heard and a man was seen leaving the area he had on a yellow hood and a black jacket one person was left on the inside of that vehicle he had received multiple gunshots about the body
8141143 but we take this time to appeal to persons to settle their conflicts without resorting to violence talk things over get someone responsible and respected involved to help settle the dispute
8141144 it was in december when he was shot in his stomach
8141145 the bullet went through his stomach and came out of his back
8141146 even since this latest incident we havent heard from the police
8141147 my son was a human being not a stray dog we want justice
8141148 they need to arrest these people because they know who the culprits are they need to hang them or whip them get them off the streets enough enough of this
8141149 from what i see it clearly went over the line
8141150 from my seat i thought it wasnt but i when i talked to him a little bit he said he saw it as going out once i got back to the dugout everybody said they saw it go out we still need replay no question
8141151 he kept the ball low and mixed it up real well and had command of all his pitches when hes doing that you just try to battle we hit some balls hard and some were caught those days happen
8141152 his command was good and breaking ball was good i thought he attacked the bottom of the strike zone really well with his fastball and thats what we want wandy to do
8141153 i was holding it here near the waist and i moved it up here in front of his face
8141154 i feel more comfortable every pitch i threw was better my breaking ball my fastball
8141155 i threw a bad pitch but it was hit well it was good pitch it was a strike but it was bad location
8141156 i just hoped the umpire was going to make the wrong call
8141157 i was going to play it off like it was a hit but i could see it from my perspective and he made the right call you cant take it away from him
8141158 the idea is to get it right and i think the umpires have done a pretty good job to this point its always great to be able to look at in the screen like that
8141159 i dont think it happens that frequently where its going to slow down the game
8141160 actually it wont slow down the game at all because if the crew chief decides to look at the replay it takes as long as the four umpires getting together
8141161 i want to be way over 500 you can go back through the summer and see some games that got away from us and would have put us right smack in the middle of the wild card hunt but other teams can say the same thing

8141163 nexentastor delivers the ideal balance of performance scalability and cost of ownership for digital media applications and by switching to nexentastors unique zfs based architecture weve seen time savings for our storage administration and more importantly limitless and instant backups for our designs
8141164 we are very happy to highlight the positive experience of motek entertainment in using nexentastor in front of iscsi for improved performance and manageability
8141165 were seeing more and more users that like the cost savings of iscsi but want the enhanced performance and the advanced data integrity capabilities of nexentastor as sata disks can suffer from silent data corruption the unique ability of zfss end to end check sums to catch this corruption is especially important for firms like motek who rely upon accurate data for their success

8141167 sinds ik lid werd van de raad van bestuur van devgen in september 2006 transformeerde devgen zeer snel van een pure leverancier van technologie naar een volledig ge ntegreerd agrobedrijf gefocust op nematiciden en hybride zaden van onderzoek tot de boer en met speciale aandacht voor hybride rijstzaad en biotechtraits voor rijst
8141168 de kans dat belangenconflicten opduiken met mijn vorige werkgever bayer ag waarvoor hybride rijst ook een strategisch gewas is neemt daarom toe ik voelde aan dat om goede corporate governance te kunnen blijven waarborgen en om persoonlijke conflicten te vermijden de beste oplossing was om een stap opzij te zetten en ontslag te nemen als lid van de raad van bestuur
8141169 we bedanken pol voor zijn waardevolle bijdrage aan de firma en respecteren zijn beslissing
8141170 op korte termijn werd hybride rijst inderdaad een zeer competitief domein waarin devgen nu een vooraanstaande rol speelt en ik kijk ernaar uit om het bedrijf te ondersteunen bij zijn ambitieuze groeiplannen om een leidinggevende positie in te nemen in deze snel ontwikkelende markt
8141171 since i joined the devgen board in september 2006 devgen has transformed rapidly from a pure technology supplier into a fully integrated agribusiness company focused on nematicides and on hybrid seed from research to farmer with emphasis on hybrid rice seed and rice biotech traits
8141172 the likelihood that conflict of interest issues arise with my previous employer bayer ag for whom hybrid rice is also a strategic crop is therefore increasing i felt that to assure good corporate governance and avoid personal conflicts it was best to step aside and resign from the devgen board
8141173 we thank pol for his valuable contribution to the company and we respect his decision
8141174 in a short time hybrid rice has indeed become a highly competitive field in which devgen is now a premium player and i look forward to supporting the company in its ambitious growth plans to become a leading player in this developing market space
8141175 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8141176 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8141177 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8141178 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8141179 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8141180 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8141181 realistically were going to have to go through the process of trying to find another affiliate preferably in that league

8141193 i thought she was outstanding the illinois senator said after watching clintons convention speech in denver at the home of local supporters
8141194 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election he said
8141195 you can entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience

8141251 what seems to be true from preliminary studies is that the gene variants that were under strong selection reached fixation over the last 10k years are different in different clusters that is the way that modern people in each cluster differ due to natural selection from their own ancestors 10k years ago is not the same in each cluster we have been at least at the genetic level experiencing divergent evolution

8141256 since i joined the devgen board in september 2006 devgen has transformed rapidly from a pure technology supplier into a fully integrated agribusiness company focused on nematicides and on hybrid seed from research to farmer with emphasis on hybrid rice seed and rice biotech traits
8141257 the likelihood that conflict of interest issues arise with my previous employer bayer ag for whom hybrid rice is also a strategic crop is therefore increasing i felt that to assure good corporate governance and avoid personal conflicts it was best to step aside and resign from the devgen board
8141258 we thank pol for his valuable contribution to the company and we respect his decision
8141259 in a short time hybrid rice has indeed become a highly competitive field in which devgen is now a premium player and i look forward to supporting the company in its ambitious growth plans to become a leading player in this developing market space
8141260 at first i said no to oliver i gave him names of other actors i was afraid to do it
8141261 i think everyone is better and i think any team can compete with anybody
8141262 i think were returning to where we need to be to have a great team come out of our conference
8141263 i know they lost some good players but talking to doug they feel good about their chances
8141264 they have some top athletes they have momentum and a system 3 5 3 theyre really comfortable with
8141265 offensively they have playmakers who can break games wide open at any time
8141266 it helps me to understand our potential as a team because im not coming into the east blind
8141267 i know there are some returning playoff teams that will be strong again but i feel we should be jockeying with those teams for the top half of the conference
8141268 i like to think were a sleeping giant right now
8141269 britney spears will not be performing at the vmas this year im telling you officially and unequivocally
8141270 contrary to media reports britney was never slated to perform on this years vmas shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on the studio
8141271 making clothes together in our studio makes us feel complete we probably sound like a group of grannies in a knitting circle but its the truth and it gives us some control over our visual identity
8141272 we see if they have a sewing kit in the amenities draw in case we feel inspired
8141273 when you are a big band and everyone is taking shots at you the more things you can do together the better

8141276 we envision a world where there are more car sharers than car owners
8141277 really acted as this motivator for people to re evaluate the cost of owning a car
8141278 we are extremely mindful of the impact our students transportation choices have on the environment
8141279 im glad that theres something like this at rice because i think we need to be more environmentally conscious
8141280 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point agreement
8141281 in accordance with united nations security council resolutions that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized borders of georgia and they must remain so
8141282 that was no easy choice to make but it is the sole chance of saving people s lives
8141283 if that opportunity comes up again tonight i wouldnt hesitate to go with him again
8141284 she knocked over the drum set while smiling at the horrified guests
8141285 she was trying to make out with women and married men
8141286 a pregnant wife caught her in the act stormed off and walked home in disgust
8141287 tried to make her leave and was seen throwing her to the ground in the parking lot
8141288 she wasnt just kissing the married men she was also grabbing their crotches
8141289 none of it is true my husband was with me the entire time
8141290 she tripped with her high heels in the parking lot of nellos it is gravel not hard ground i nearly fell
8141291 at these parties people always get frisky all i can say is that she didnt try to grab me
8141292 why own up to your crappy behavior when you can deny and make paranoid accusations

8141294 systemwide we typically adjust our flight schedules based on demand
8141295 these changes will apply to january through march when we see some drop off in travel and traffic
8141296 thats just not the case and because it is such a long distance to travel people are going to look for an alternative airline
8141297 were all hoping another carrier will start nonstop service but still would prefer continental
8141298 but the people in amarillo might because they could see a 30 percent reduction
8141299 that is pretty consistent with which we announced in june which was a 7 9 percent reduction

8141315 in the end the theory of the indispensable man failed mr giuliani left office on schedule at the end of 2001 both the city and the republic survived now mr bloomberg is making noises that sound suspiciously like an echo of that theory after years of speaking unswervingly in favor of term limits he has wavered he now seems open at least to the concept of a voter dodging maneuver by the city council to give him and other city officials a third term beyond 2009
8141316 but it just could be that mr bloomberg like mr giuliani has never fully absorbed charles de gaulle s admonition about indispensable men the graveyards de gaulle said are full of them not bad advice for would be presidents too come to think of it

8141318 i want to express our gratitude to mr dickerson who stepped into the role as chairman at a critical time of need
8141319 they have sent a strong message that they believe they are not on the hook for the entire amount if any
8141320 our hope continues to be that we will resolve the matter amicably with the faa however long that takes
8141321 we would hope that the faa will continue to discuss the matter with us in good faith as we have been doing all along
8141322 from a team standpoint it meant a lot because were in the heat of a pennant race
8141323 this is a long road trip for us and we need to win games so the personal stuff is out the window the most important thing is to win games and get into the postseason
8141324 and lou cucuzza the clubhouse guy here got some dirt from the mound
8141325 playing in this league the last 14 15 years and pitching here for such a long period of time its such a cathedral of sports and to walk in to the hallowed grounds such great players before us have played their game and walked and ran and hit its very special
8141326 i was in a situation where one i shouldnt have been in it happens i got over dealing with being welcomed back to boston and it was unbelievable at the baseball writers dinner that winter i got a standing ovation
8141327 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
8141328 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
8141329 we really think this is a game changer for the renewables industry
8141330 we are so excited not only to headline our own annual summer festival but also to be able to share the stage with the next generation of great rock bands theres not a lot m tley cr e hasnt done so to say this summers festival is going to be about rock n roll excess is an understatement a night of hit songs by great bands and a trail of panties coast to coast cr e fest hell yeah
8141331 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
8141332 overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
8141333 its definitely strange youre always used to seeing manny there in that part of the lineup now hes not going to be there but they still have a good team
8141334 mannys a great hitter just like he was with cleveland those battles were good times good times
8141335 forrest gump just running and it happened that bailey was safe i thought he was going to be out at first to be honest i wasnt even thinking i ended up running as hard as i could
8141336 i saw it hit the bag as i came out of the box and it kicked up to a rod like he was expecting it
8141337 all i could do was run as hard as possible
8141338 i turned around and saw jason giambi not throwing the ball and coco scoring that was just great baserunning right there
8141339 thats about as big a situation as youre going to find poise is not a problem he deserves to be in those situations
8141340 im doing a lot of strength exercises and all of it id say has been pain free
8141341 i think today im going to start hitting from a tee and go from there im real excited its all positive its all good stuff
8141342 you take a deep breath and you cough and it hurts you feel like thats a long way from taking a baseball swing but everything has their path and i think i did the rehab exactly as they asked me to do it we have what 32 games left i think you want to be a part of that
8141343 id be lying if i said it didnt go through my mind
8141344 but the timetable for me coming back this time is in a worst case scenario still two plus weeks remaining in the season so i think there would be time to get back in the flow
8141345 thats why i want to be smart with this injury i dont want something to happen again and then i lose those two weeks and now were looking at three days before the season is over i dont want to be in that situation
8141346 when i woke up the next morning after the oblique you know how you wake up in the morning and you figure youve had a good nights sleep and youre going to feel great and i really didnt i was walking hunched over thinking i was a long way from playing baseball

8141348 we just wanted to give our institutions a heads up that our examiners are going to be focusing on this area
8141349 as sandy creek has not indicated any intention of obtaining this determination it is not only in violation of the caa but is pouring money daily into the construction of a facility that will require huge and costly modification to come into compliance
8141350 it was when hillary and bill came and it was like 90 to 100 degrees i just handed people water and stuff i was wearing a gore t shirt
8141351 is just helping people get set up in the morning
8141352 it was pretty cool seeing ted kennedy and michelle obama i just liked how many people had their signs up
8141353 he was put to work hed go to events and hand out literature bumper stickers a lot of publicity stuff
8141354 american people had their first date with michelle obama and it was matched in another way by another generation by ted kennedy
8141355 spanned the generations to the way people were inspired and motivated by john kennedy those of us who were their age at one time had a similar opportunity to be motivated by change
8141356 ted kennedy inspired us one more time and michelle obama is modeling that change it was an unusual historic event and ive never been prouder to be a democrat in my life
8141357 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8141358 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8141359 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8141360 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8141361 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8141362 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8141363 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8141364 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8141365 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8141366 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8141367 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8141368 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8141369 we were still working over the speech text in the car over to the fleet center in 2004
8141370 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8141371 i wanted to make 10 short sharp perfect tracks no more than three minutes long i wanted pop music that hits you hard

8141374 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
8141375 actually newt gingrich is working to help prevent climate change
8141376 seems everyone that believes in gravity also hate ice cream
8141377 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
8141378 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8141379 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8141380 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8141381 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen
8141382 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us
8141383 okay so see that paint color behind the murderer there do you think it would look good with stainless steel appliances
8141384 i know and its not just a fridge youre buying you also have to love that brand dishwasher and oven too so they all match
8141385 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
8141386 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
8141387 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
8141388 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
8141389 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
8141390 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
8141391 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
8141392 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
8141393 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
8141394 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
8141395 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
8141396 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
8141397 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
8141398 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
8141399 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
8141400 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
8141401 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
8141402 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
8141403 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
8141404 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
8141405 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
8141406 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8141407 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
8141408 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
8141409 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
8141410 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
8141411 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
8141412 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool
8141413 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
8141414 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
8141415 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
8141416 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
8141417 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
8141418 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
8141419 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
8141420 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
8141421 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
8141422 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
8141423 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
8141424 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
8141425 this is embarrassing we gotta get more people in here
8141426 id prefer to spend more time talking about senator obama
8141427 im trying to absorb as much of the experience as possible and not just be shuttled from one event to another
8141428 watching him in the debates with hillary i felt like he was a good listener
8141429 probably because all five of you used the same bandage
8141430 i keep telling you goblins that sharing is not always caring nurse sterilize these
8141431 ill lance it but youll need to keep it clean
8141432 cant you waylay some do gooders carrying clean water for once
8141433 but it hard to tell before we drop the big rock
8141434 so this time we have escalated the penalty to a black screen that reappears every hour until the user validates his or her copy of win xp pro
8141435 mdec respects the rights of companies to protect their intellectual property its a reminder that software piracy doesnt pay especially when malaysians are themselves putting a lot of effort into creating original software
8141436 microsoft has stopped selling win xp in the market so you have to wonder why it is spending time and money to take down users of pirated copies of this os
8141437 why isnt it also targeting users who have pirated copies of windows vista
8141438 so if im using a pirated copy of vista at this time i wont be hassled got to wonder about that
8141439 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8141440 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8141441 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8141442 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8141443 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8141444 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8141445 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8141446 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8141447 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8141448 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8141449 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
8141450 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
8141451 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
8141452 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
8141453 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
8141454 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
8141455 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
8141456 the same speech hes been giving for months why didnt he give the germans something more
8141457 it was a tent in the desert 100 degree heat off and on for what seemed like forever
8141458 why was i held by the united states like that when i was their ally
8141459 if theyre exaggerating and distorting this much in august what will october be like
8141460 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8141461 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8141462 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8141463 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8141464 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8141465 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8141466 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8141467 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8141468 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8141469 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8141470 get these c ked out scottsdale chicks out of here
8141471 mattel ha dado seguimiento a este caso en primer lugar y antes que nada como una cuesti n de principios

8141475 well let you know if we can use your services
8141476 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8141477 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8141478 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8141479 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8141480 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8141481 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8141482 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8141483 primarily to cover mr aas acquisition costs of the shares as well as accumulated wealth tax costs of the past six years as a result of the holdings in funcom
8141484 within four weeks i was at level 57 so i almost got to level 60 and then
8141485 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
8141486 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
8141487 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
8141488 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
8141489 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
8141490 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
8141491 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
8141492 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
8141493 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
8141494 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
8141495 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
8141496 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
8141497 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
8141498 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
8141499 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
8141500 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
8141501 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
8141502 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
8141503 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
8141504 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
8141505 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
8141506 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
8141507 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
8141508 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
8141509 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
8141510 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
8141511 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
8141512 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
8141513 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
8141514 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
8141515 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
8141516 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
8141517 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
8141518 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
8141519 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
8141520 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
8141521 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8141522 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8141523 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8141524 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8141525 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8141526 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
8141527 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8141528 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8141529 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8141530 since i joined the devgen board in september 2006 devgen has transformed rapidly from a pure technology supplier into a fully integrated agribusiness company focused on nematicides and on hybrid seed from research to farmer with emphasis on hybrid rice seed and rice biotech traits
8141531 the likelihood that conflict of interest issues arise with my previous employer bayer ag for whom hybrid rice is also a strategic crop is therefore increasing i felt that to assure good corporate governance and avoid personal conflicts it was best to step aside and resign from the devgen board
8141532 we thank pol for his valuable contribution to the company and we respect his decision
8141533 in a short time hybrid rice has indeed become a highly competitive field in which devgen is now a premium player and i look forward to supporting the company in its ambitious growth plans to become a leading player in this developing market space
8141534 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
8141535 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8141536 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8141537 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8141538 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
8141539 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
8141540 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
8141541 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
8141542 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
8141543 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
8141544 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
8141545 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
8141546 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
8141547 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
8141548 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
8141549 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
8141550 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
8141551 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
8141552 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
8141553 in response to a sharp increase in demand for solar power generation systems
8141554 i am a historian i am not a believer but i must confess as a historian that this penniless preacher from nazareth is irrevocably the very center of history jesus christ is easily the most dominant figure in all history
8141555 here i am i stand at the door and knock if anyone hears my voice and opens the door i will come in and eat with him and he with me
8141556 everyone who calls upon the name of the lord will be saved
8141557 the accusations are baseless and do not make sense the bank of china will respond to the suit to clarify and ensure a correct understanding of the facts by going through the legal procedures
8141558 we will reserve the right to lodge a counter claim and other necessary legal actions we believe the us court will make just rulings in accordance with the law and the facts
8141559 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
8141560 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8141561 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8141562 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8141563 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8141564 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8141565 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8141566 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8141567 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8141568 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8141569 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8141570 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8141571 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8141572 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8141573 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8141574 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8141575 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8141576 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8141577 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8141578 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8141579 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8141580 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8141581 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8141582 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8141583 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8141584 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
8141585 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
8141586 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
8141587 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
8141588 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
8141589 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8141590 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8141591 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8141592 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8141593 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8141594 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8141595 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8141596 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8141597 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8141598 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8141599 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8141600 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8141601 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8141602 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8141603 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8141604 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8141605 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8141606 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8141607 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8141608 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8141609 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8141610 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8141611 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8141612 theres an embrace between barbie and ken but not kissing toy executives want to keep barbies squeaky clean image
8141613 gerade in einer zeit wo einige wenige jugendliche mit ihren brutalen gewalttaten eine ganze generation in verruf bringen ist es wohltuend zu erleben dass besonders die menschen denen es gut geht in unserer gesellschaft auch an die denken die es nicht immer leicht haben
8141614 wir sind der meinung dass lebensqualit t soziales umfeld und freude an der arbeit drei wesentliche elemente sind um menschen gl cklicher zu sein die verantwortung f r soziale projekte dient damit nicht daf r ein m gliches schlechtes gewissen zu bereinigen sondern ist ausdruck unserer grunds tzlichen denkweise
8141615 denkmalgesch tzte immobilien sind bauliche anlagen an deren erhaltung wegen ihrer geschichtlichen k nstlerischen und st dtebaulichen bedeutung ein ffentliches interesse besteht auf der ebene der besitzer und mieter bieten sie eine nachhaltige lebensqualit t und eine hohe sicherheit was den besitz von sachwertanlagen anbelangt
8141616 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8141617 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8141618 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8141619 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8141620 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8141621 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8141622 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8141623 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
8141624 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
8141625 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
8141626 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
8141627 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
8141628 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8141629 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8141630 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8141631 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8141632 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8141633 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8141634 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8141635 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8141636 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8141637 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8141638 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8141639 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8141640 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8141641 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
8141642 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
8141643 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
8141644 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
8141645 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
8141646 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
8141647 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
8141648 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
8141649 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8141650 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8141651 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8141652 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
8141653 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
8141654 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
8141655 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
8141656 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
8141657 since 1978 more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with ayurvedic medicine use have been reported worldwide
8141658 this study highlights the need for congress to revisit the way dietary supplements are regulated in the us
8141659 our first priority must be the safety of the public herbs and supplements with high levels of lead mercury and arsenic should not be available for sale on the internet or elsewhere
8141660 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
8141661 the medicines which are supposed to cure sickness should not promote another illness due to the presence of toxic materials such as lead
8141662 strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements
8141663 i just needed something a little more exciting more physical
8141664 a friend introduced me to a club football i tried out and loved it
8141665 our games would have 200 250 people mostly friends and family
8141666 its pretty overwhelming when you come over here and play in front of 30 000 at robertson stadium
8141667 i struggled with the transition from german football to the college level
8141668 the rules are pretty much the same but you dont have as many athletes because its not as popular in germany the tempo and quickness arent the same the overall skills arent as high thats a big adjustment
8141669 i took english in high school so i had the basics down i got across what i was trying to say but i couldnt hold up a real conversation that first year or so the team made me feel right at home i made great friends even though i wasnt able to communicate that much they took me in and taught me and spent time with me the team became like a second family
8141670 i like to do things i like to learn things i really do like the weight room when you work hard you see the results its the same on the field when you make a mistake you see it on film and work to correct it i enjoy that part of it
8141671 he was pretty quiet when he got here because he didnt speak the language he was opened up since then he has a great sense of humor
8141672 you practice with the same guys for hours everyday and its fun when you compete with them against other people when youre playing well its 11 guys becoming one i love it
8141673 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
8141674 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
8141675 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
8141676 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8141677 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8141678 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8141679 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8141680 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8141681 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8141682 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8141683 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8141684 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8141685 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8141686 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8141687 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8141688 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8141689 if its a pac 10 game then its a pac 10 game does that make any sense
8141690 thats the biggest thing when people talk about our team
8141691 it isnt the 10 wins from last season its the 55 sacks
8141692 the republican party is the next guy in line party whoever he picks as vice president could become the next guy in line if he picks a mainstream conservative then the conservatives can get excited not just about the mccain candidacy but the future of the party
8141693 a week ago romney and pawlenty looked like the two most likely conservative choices but i think over the last several days events have conspired against both of them
8141694 barr on colbert so close to a discussion about global warming but no cigar
8141695 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8141696 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8141697 use it up wear it out make it do or do without
8141698 a major requirement of the hana financial group was to select a standards based authentication solution the actividentity mini token was selected as it complies with the oath open standard providing compatibility with 3rd party software and assurance of future proofing as i
8141699 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8141700 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8141701 ill be honest with you folks and i dont mean to make this very blunt but if we dont come up with anything tonight this deal is gone were pulling out and you guys can do whatever you want to
8141702 i think we agree that a sports complex would be a great asset to our area and certainly a winner for a sports complex would be the youth in our area
8141703 a part of building the complex is a business deal
8141704 if the town of abingdon were putting up 60 percent of the obligation you would not let the county have equal representation on the board that was going to undertake the obligation it wouldnt make good business sense
8141705 the very bottom of this comes to an issue of trust between that body and this body
8141706 this is our one opportunity to come together jointly in a partnership
8141707 its stuck in my mind all these years and here we are fighting over one person on an authority commission
8141708 so if you guys are not going to vote to do what were asking you to do
8141709 we should never ever ever have gotten to this place
8141710 we shouldve sat down as two groups together two governing bodies before we made a land deal
8141711 if this project does go by the wayside theres going to be a lot of disappointed families
8141712 the development either independently or in conjunction with one of the countys towns of a recreation multi sports facility accessible and designed to meet and accommodate local use as well as regional or statewide tournament type events
8141713 if george w bush was seeking re election wed be 20 points ahead
8141714 in arizona the only way to get around is by small private plane
8141715 we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states
8141716 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8141717 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8141718 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8141719 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8141720 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8141721 i am sure you dont give a damn about what i need
8141722 if he wont do this then i wont either thatll show him
8141723 its good we have forced bradwood to admit they were behind these polls but it doesnt change the fact that they have violated campaign finance laws and need to be held accountable
8141724 breach of faith hurricane katrina and the near death of a great american city
8141725 the city that care forgot was itself learning to forget
8141726 while sympathetic to the new progressives bai describes a movement long on anger and short on thought
8141727 homo politicus the strange and scary tribes that run our government
8141728 didnt have weapons of mass destruction to tell the world where they are
8141729 no you dont get all your negatives for 395 only the proofs that are given to you in your package
8141730 this has been the most devastating fire weve seen in recent memory
8141731 looks like weve got to do school shopping all over again
8141732 the port staff itself has now issued 166 change orders on the c 60 project when baggage system projects of a similar size at other major airports like minneapolis st paul in g amp t conveyors experience generate less than 10 change orders
8141733 the point is to get where you have enough of a stockpile so you only have to buy perishables
8141734 it is helpful in learning to appreciate and develop your ability to change to think about how you have changed over time you are not the same person you were ten years ago how are you different what were you like before would your present self and past self be friends if they met what would they like and dislike about each other how did you come to be the person you are now your ideals thoughts and opinions have changed what has replaced the old ones and why by reviewing the changes that have occurred you can savor the growth and progress you have made and appreciate the benefits the process of change has brought to your life when you notice how much you have changed and developed even without consciously trying you can see how much you could grow if you made a real effort to change
8141735 what can you do today that you could not do 5 years ago
8141736 theres some equality a sense that adults and children are learning together
8141737 when people feel like theyre part of their education they learn better theres stronger deeper learning that way
8141738 as no 1 is one of the few schools that advertises the fact that parents have the opportunity to opt their kids out of the wasl
8141739 and they havent turned the school into a factory for getting good scores
8141740 if you ask families what their hopes and dreams are for their children how many do you think are going to say man i hope they knock the top off that wasl test
8141741 those are the things that im concerned about and its not the wasl scores that measure that
8141742 it might inspire people to dig in their heels even more
8141743 the smart spending guide how to cut your grocery bills in half save on your everyday expenses and live within your means
8141744 i encourage people to remember not every meal has to be sunday dinner
8141745 cannot be cut back it has to be maintained it has to move forward
8141746 if were really going to be globally competitive were going to have to get out of the box
8141747 this is an extremely versatile stew that can incorporate a wide range of late summer market produce in various combinations with great results it is an ideal make ahead dinner all elements can be prepared several hours in advance and then quickly combined right before serving at the restaurant we serve it with a fresh cucumber yogurt raita and spicy pickled red onions but it would pair well with a prepared chutney as well the dumplings are dense sour and chewy similar to the traditional southern indian idli which are typically made from fermented dal and rice

8141782 mit den jahren verschieben sich die werte im leben das musste auch ich feststellen
8141783 das leben ffnet neue reize und ziele die dinge die ich als rennfahrer erreicht habe waren fantastisch und haben mir viel spa bereitet aber jetzt der passende zeitpunkt um neue priorit ten zu setzen eine dieser neuen aspekte ist die geburt meines sohnes
8141784 den ersten podestplatz hat er mit derbi eingefahren den ersten sieg und den ersten wm titel mit gilera dazu kommen die 250er siege und der zweite wm titel 2003 mit aprilia
8141785 when you come right down to it all you have is yourself the sun is a thousand rays in your belly all the rest is nothing
8141786 you know music art these are not just little decorations to make life prettier theyre very deep necessitites which people cannot live without
8141787 it would have been more suitable for him to have laid aside his body with honour than to endure so shameful a death
8141788 according to the prince of the power of the air of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience
8141789 everything in the world the cravings of sinful man the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does comes not from the father
8141790 we have seen and testify that the father has sent his son to be the savior of the world
8141791 the cross is therefore at the same time both the affirmation of gods hatred of sin and its foul consequences especially the defacing of his image in his human creatures and the affirmation of his steadfast determination to save humanity and the world
8141792 angry at jesus challenge to their sovereignty stripped him naked held him up to pubic contempt and celebrated a triumph over him
8141793 its behaviour its distinctions of race and class and sex its blind obedience to the forces of politics economics prejudice and superstition
8141794 hollywood hasnt produced any quality movies in the past fifteen years
8141795 im not prejudiced when i say that colored people have a lot of violence in them like animals the irishman will get sloppy drunk and pass out the italian will shout and scream his head off the jew will figure out a way he can make himself a little more money and get even with someone that way but your nigger hes vicious like a wild leopard or something when hes been drinking or on drugs they throw lye at each other 4 and scalding water and god knows what
8141796 i believe you should know the man not where his grandfather came from
8141797 most negro people are too busy for demonstrations they go to work like the rest of us
8141798 is to ascribe a certain trait to a group with little or no evidence to support it to judge the trait to be undesirable and to hold the object group responsible for the trait and therefore blameworthy
8141799 he really meas because i dislike them they are causes of stereotyping
8141800 the root of almost all the evil in intergroup relations
8141801 to identify ourselves with one group or another there is often no room for neutralism oe must be either for or against enemy 8 or patriot in group or out group
8141802 will not be swept away by folk generalizations concerning arthritis snake bite or the efficacy of aspirin but he may be content with 9 will overgeneralizations concerning politics social insurance or mexicans
8141803 the graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire thou shalt not desire the silver and gold that is on them nor take it unto thee lest thou be snared therein for it is an abomination to the lord thy god
8141804 oh yeah forgot bout that i wonder will they lend me money
8141805 oh its just that there are so many rules to follow its interesting that you follow all of them despite living in liberal state
8141806 wir sagen dass der fall kosovo mit keinem anderen fall zu vergleichen ist
8141807 sest f licit liu peng ministre chinois des sports pas de dans certains sports les chinois nont laiss que des miettes au reste du monde ce fut le cas sur certains de ses traditionnels points forts comme le tennis de table quatre titres sur quatre
8141808 i asked god for all things that i might enjoy life
8141809 there is only two ways to love to love fully or to love dirty and they like peanut butter and jelly go really good in a sandwich
8141810 all love is is loving all which means you hate none
8141811 there are worse things than being alone but it often takes decades to realize this and most often when you do its too late and theres nothing worse than too late
8141812 time is the master and time can be a disaster
8141813 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8141814 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8141815 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8141816 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8141817 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8141818 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8141819 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8141820 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8141821 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8141822 we are on the same team this is a fight for the future a fight we must win together
8141823 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8141824 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8141825 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8141826 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8141827 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8141828 generally thats optimistic i expect that it will be delayed further
8141829 this was a failure mode we have not seen before
8141830 theyre working with an antique system thats overloaded by high traffic growth
8141831 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8141832 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8141833 if they want to preserve good relations with russia in the west they will understand the reason behind our decision
8141834 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8141835 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8141836 it was two against one you know and no one helped him
8141837 i didnt think that it would happen but it was not safe for him to work there
8141838 we also know through 75 years of experience that federal correctional facilities are managed most effectively through frequent and direct communication with inmates
8141839 i dont think that will diminish their communication at all
8141840 every single inmate in there is armed to the teeth for his own protection
8141841 i am not bruce lee so i cant take on 110 inmates by myself every day it is like david vs goliath you are taking on the world by yourself
8141842 the homicide rates among the inmate populations are at the highest levels theyve ever been in the history of the bureau of prisons
8141843 the assaults on staff whether weapons or no weapons has intensified
8141844 the safety and security of our staff continues to be the highest priority of the bureau of prisons
8141845 the population is just too unpredictable and you never know if they are going to turn on you or not
8141846 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8141847 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8141848 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8141849 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8141850 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8141851 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8141852 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8141853 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8141854 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8141855 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8141856 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8141857 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8141858 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8141859 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8141860 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8141861 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8141862 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8141863 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8141864 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8141865 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8141866 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8141867 removing life vests from airplanes to save fuel is like making cars more fuel efficient by removing seat belts
8141868 jazz is trying to cut costs i much rather have them remove a life vest i wont need than have to pay for yet another fuel surcharge
8141869 who is going to fly an airline with fewer safety features
8141870 if the government is trying to run out the clock on the 110th congress todays decision suggests that judge bates wont let them
8141871 i am heartened that judge bates recognized that the public interest in this matter is best served by the furtherance of the committees investigation
8141872 without any supporting judicial precedent whatsoever and indeed in the face of supreme court case law that effectively forecloses the basis for the assertion of absolute immunity here it is difficult to see how the executive can demonstrate that it has a substantial likelihood of success on appeal or even that a serious legal question is presented
8141873 there is a very strong possibility that the committee will be unable to complete its investigation before congress expires that may leave important public concerns regarding the nations federal criminal justice system unaddressed
8141874 how could i have been so stupid for so long
8141875 aw shoot i lost the comb in your hair girl i think were gonna have to shampoo it you just cant comb out curly hair
8141876 hey hey miss a i got her hair sectioned off like a soccer ball now what do i do i aint never cut hair before
8141877 miss a im finished will you come check her for me
8141878 i am greatful to you for giving me the power of geass
8141879 i remember one student who was fresh out of high school and there was some stalking going on
8141880 angela walked the young woman to her car in the parking garage she said nobody should be afraid
8141881 stood out because she seemed to be almost fighting so hard for her education
8141882 she just seemed to be under financial or time restrictions
8141883 she would be friendly but she would say what she thought
8141884 the classic itself because of the sponsorship from the various corporations will probably raise in terms of net profit about 100 000
8141885 those dollars will go to scholarship support as well as athletic department support
8141886 our private funding for the university as a whole has grown from 2001 when we were raising roughly 600 000 to now we are raising 4 1 million
8141887 football serves as a magnet for some people who may not otherwise consider higher education
8141888 our job once we get them here is to turn them on to the possibilities of what that education can do for them
8141889 so football helps us in that sense because we take the school to them
8141890 i think the kinship was more a result of the entire kennedy legacy
8141891 we need it big time i thought obama had the best chance of winning its a historic convention
8141892 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
8141893 im trying to focus on the convention and other things
8141894 you could just tell it was something she had to deal with in the past
8141895 iban a matar a obama desde un punto elevado utilizando un rifle

8141903 se trata de un deporte donde los exponentes tienen mucho fogueo y fortaleza espiritual desarrollan car cter y mentalidad triunfadora lo que permite que estos elementos lleguen con todo a los torneos oficiales
8141904 vemos pasar autoridades y simplemente no pasa nada pero reconozco que al menos a nivel municipal en torre n s hemos tenido apoyos incluso se nos ha asignado un sitio en el auditorio municipal para trabajar como centro de alto rendimiento que aunque a n no se equipa es un buen inicio ello gracias a la comisi n municipal del deporte que nos ha apoyado cuando no hemos tenido el respaldo de inedec
8141905 espero que carlos hermosillo cumpla la promesa de mandar rendir cuentas a los directores de los institutos estatales entre ellos el nuestro a fin de que podamos saber cu l es el destino de los recursos destinados a apoyar al deporte de alto rendimiento

8141942 a scheme for early release of substantial numbers of staff in the ministry of defence
8141943 the decision under challenge is the defendants decision to call for volunteers from the affected groups of staff for selection for release on what are known as flexible early retirement or severance terms
8141944 the scheme ers is required because there is said to be a surplus of staff in the affected groups and the defendant is seeking to achieve substantial reduction in the numbers of civil servants in the relevant groups through this process of volunteering and being selected either for early retirement or severance
8141945 even though members of staff wish to accept such terms and are not subject to compulsory retirement

8141963 die zusammenlegung von sozialhilfe und arbeitslosenhilfe war ein v llig richtiger schritt

8141966 ich halte die risiken der politischen szenarien in hessen f r unvertretbar
8141967 wird das sie selbst die spd in hessen und die bundes spd vor der bundestagswahl schwer besch digen
8141968 ist sie abh ngig von der linken und den traumata des herrn lafontaine sie begibt sich in die h nde einer partei die einfluss ohne verantwortung ohne jede verpflichtung h tte die w chentlich daf r sorgen kann dass regierungsf higkeit wieder verloren geht
8141969 es st rt mich dass die linke nicht in eine politische haftung genommen werden w rde darauf hat franz m ntefering schon im februar hingewiesen
8141970 nicht vorstellen mit leuten auf einer bank zu sitzen die zum teil mitverantwortlich waren diese geschichte nicht aufarbeiten und sich nicht davon distanzieren
8141971 ich erinnere wie das in den 70er und 80er jahren gelaufen ist die schulden sind gestiegen der abschwung kam trotzdem
8141972 es gibt abw rtsrisiken die ich nicht untersch tze aber ich widerspreche allen die schnellz ngig eine rezession herbeireden wir sind in keiner rezession
8141973 wir gucken uns verschiedene varianten an wie man das ndern k nnte ein freibetrag ist dabei eine denkbare m glichkeit
8141974 ich habe einfach versucht so schnell wie m glich wieder zur ckzukommen
8141975 ich bin aber immer optimistisch und jetzt bin ich fit und kann voll angreifen da muss ich keinen kampf scheuen nat rlich will ich den stammplatz erobern
8141976 ich stehe im kader und bereite mich so vor dass ich spielen kann
8141977 im endeffekt entscheidet das aber der trainer denn klar ist auch dass ich noch nicht lange wieder mittrainiere
8141978 ich habe erst heute in der fr h in der zeitung davon gelesen das w re f r uns schon eine schw chung

8141983 bisher ist abb noch nicht sehr stark im solargesch ft verwurzelt
8141984 wir sp ren keine zur ckhaltung beim investitionsverhalten unserer kunden
8141985 wir sind zuversichtlich dass sich alle unsere kernm rkte weiterhin sehr positiv entwickeln
8141986 solange sich eine rezession auf eine weltregion beschr nkt k nnen wir damit recht gut umgehen
8141987 wir wollen beispielsweise in allen divisionen unser servicegesch ft ausbauen da es wenig kapitalintensiv und kaum zyklisch ist
8141988 wir rechnen damit bereits mitte des n chsten jahres die gewinnzone zu erreichen
8141989 es gibt eine konsolidierung am ende werden nur zwei oder drei plattformen brig bleiben
8141990 die halbjahreszahlen 2008 zeigen dass wir den nettoerl s gesteigert und den ebit deutlich verbessert haben
8141991 am 1 oktober 2008 werde ich zusammen mit mitarbeitern die firma jma j rg maurer asset management ag starten
8141992 es gibt einzelne f lle wo wir von reisen in regionen ausserhalb liechtensteins abraten
8141993 generell gilt dass ausl ndische offshore kunden f r gesch ftskontakte in die schweiz kommen
8141994 nach 2009 wird f r die pr mienzahler kostenwahrheit folgen dann werden die versicherungspr mien kostendeckend sein m ssen
8141995 eine zusammenarbeit etwa in der beschaffung wird gepr ft aber das hat nichts mit einer beteiligung zu tun
8141996 im 2 semester gehen wir von einer verbesserung der situation aus
8141997 doch davon sind wir bereits abger ckt jetzt w rden wir uns mit einer f deralen union zufrieden geben
8141998 wir m ssen alles auf dem waffenmarkt in kambodscha zusammenkaufen
8141999 er ist mein kandidat und er muss unser pr sident sein
8142000 nicht weniger als das schicksal der usa und die zukunft unserer kinder liegen in der waagschale
8142001 barack obama ist eine charmante und anst ndige pers nlichkeit mit einer liebenswerten familie aber er ist nicht bereit f r die pr sidentschaft
8142002 should i use a low helix slow spiral screw machine bit
8142003 whoever is responsible for the situation they should pay for it
8142004 without blinking an eye the owner told me the city told us to get rid of everything because it was contaminated
8142005 they literally threw everything out the window its kinda sickening
8142006 it appears that the parents of a newborn at risk of contracting hepatitis b have not presented their baby for medical treatment
8142007 according to medical advice there is no longer sufficient evidence of the effectiveness of any vaccination
8142008 i love the kids i like working with the kids
8142009 i enjoy football its just fun the kids are fun to be around
8142010 weve got four or five kids who have fair speed
8142011 theres four or five of our linemen who have played together
8142012 thats going to be our core if we can get our backfield were going to be all right
8142013 fans always ask is johnson ever going to throw the ball i like running the ball
8142014 most passing we ever do is to placate our receivers so they wouldnt get mad about blocking
8142015 weve got a new backfield and theyve got some speed
8142016 weve got quite a few kids who havent played before
8142017 it is ironic that at the very time the bush administration tried tocut back medicaid and twice vetoed legislation to extend childrens healthcoverage the public safety net cushioned the loss of employer sponsoredhealth coverage
8142018 itdemonstrates the importance that the next president should protect and notundermine the public health safety net
8142019 we knew our innovative online services would be incompletewithout traditional hands on support from real people our customer careexperts make the travel insurance buying experience easy quick andenjoyable
8142020 senator obama joined my family for an early breakfast and joined me incaring for my 87 year old client
8142021 it was an experience illnever forget and tonight i get to share it with the rest of america
8142022 our next president mopped floors he did laundry he made lunch andhe wanted to know every detail about my job
8142023 it was the mostimpressive thing ive ever seen a politician do i believe he trulyunderstands what our families need to achieve the american dream
8142024 were anticipating that this will be a big boost to our business
8142025 its sad to say but the airline has to save money fuel is controlling everybodys moves
8142026 we are adding jet bridges so you are covered all the way from the parking garage here at the airport all the way through to your transfer out to the concourse
8142027 i think its just a big win its more convenient better amenities and better passenger experience for us and i think our passengers are going to be thrilled
8142028 we have observed previously that the idea of smoking a cigarette becomes increasingly attractive to smokers while they are craving
8142029 this study suggests that when smokers are not craving they fail to appreciate just how powerful their cravings will be this lack of insight while not craving may lead them to make decisionssuch as choosing to attend a party where there will be lots of smokingthat they may come to regret
8142030 i want to find a job that is hard for everyone and i cannot see well
8142031 i even find it hard to tell what money people are giving me so i dont know what i can do
8142032 we suffer with not one but two blinding diseases river blindness onchocerciasis and trachoma
8142033 in many places such as in west africa river blindness has been completely eradicated
8142034 but the years of war have meant that its not been possible to do that in south sudan
8142035 we just dont have the surgeons or the clinical officers
8142036 the problem in south sudan is not only disease itself its the problem of how to build the capacity of the local people to help them cater for their own people
8142037 we work hard but we survive on our own without funding
8142038 these are too expensive each is about three dollars and we cannot even get the papers we need for writing braille for our educational programme
8142039 it was a counter tucked between a bar and some stairs
8142040 there was no place to sit and no board this is so spacious so clean the design with the tvs all around is beautiful the old one was terrible this is awesome
8142041 the books have simply had a couple of good seasons weve held particularly well especially in parlay cards but that will even out over time
8142042 people are still coming in and they are still excited to bet and that is the really good sign
8142043 we have a number of different types of wagers now that we never had before
8142044 we offer seven different parlay cards we have super teasers big teasers reverse teasers
8142045 we have offered the customers a number of different propositions that maybe the customer cant handicap as well as a regular game but they enjoy betting it more
8142046 parlay cards are like college students who drink beer whereas straight bets are like wine connoisseurs who drink fine wine
8142047 i think the internet really had a dampening effect on nevada sports books in the late 1990s
8142048 after that market got closed down a lot of betting came back to nevada because it is the only legal market in the u s
8142049 i think we have seen a noticeable difference since that law passed
8142050 these next six months are when we make our money
8142051 it has always been king and will always be king the world series and the triple crown horse races are nice and create some excitement but everybody loves football
8142052 its no secret that football season is our bread and butter
8142053 just to see the look on peoples face the first week of the football season its like playing a round of golf when you eagled every single hole
8142054 at two bucks a pop im not losing that much but it is more entertaining with a bet on the line
8142055 lo est n pasando muy mal hasta tal punto que en el zaid n uno de los barrios donde m s inmigrantes viven se est registrando bolsas de pobreza parecidas a las de almanj yar
8142056 un incremento de las peticiones de ayuda desde el zaid n mucho mayor que en el resto de barrios de granada
8142057 when you get yourself in to trouble is when you feel you have to do something and then you get yourself in trouble
8142058 grazie davvero ho il metodo collaudato ho solo bisogno di incoraggiamento non di aiuto effettivo mettetevi qui buoni e guardatemi fare
8142059 sputtered strain gauge manufacturers sputter deposit a layer of glass onto the diaphragm sputtered strain gauge sensors actually from a molecular bond
8142060 gauge pressure is measured relative to ambient atmospheric pressure as shown in figure 3 similar to absolute pressure the abbreviations pag pascals gauge or psia pounds per square inch gauge are use to describe gauge pressure
8142061 a classic example of overloading a pressure sensor is known as the water hammer phenomenon this occurs when a fast moving fluid is suddenly stopped by the closing of a valve the fluid has momentum that is suddenly arrested which causes a minute stretching of the vessel in which the fluid is constrained this stretching generates a pressure spike that can damage a pressure sensor
8142062 oh there isnt anything here for you then pizzas got dairy
8142063 oh doesnt leave much for you youre vegan and all
8142064 makes it difficult doesnt it all you can eat is the fruit
8142065 if you cant think of any nice comments keep your trap shut
8142066 thats the sort of thing you think but dont say unless you really dont mind looking ignorant
8142067 if you cant think of any nice comments keep your trap shut
8142068 thats the sort of thing you think but dont say unless you really dont mind looking ignorant
8142069 never argue with an idiot they bring you down to their level and then beat you with experience
8142070 putins attack drove the stock down then another set of comments drove it down further which is very important for foreign investors to understand
8142071 i have abused a lot of rights i went fighting killing a lot of people destroyed a lot of people people who were not even part of the problem
8142072 when i met christ i saw an image of a man this guy was bright very bright so that i could not look at him twice
8142073 if the punishment deserved according to law and for the future history of this country is death fine if it is to be hanged fine if its life imprisonment fine or if they can pardon me fine also
8142074 the last time i gave the government and the nation two options either collect every one of us dig one big hole and cover us to die or they consider us and work with us to give us some discipline and use us as rebuilding tools
8142075 i am trying to do a lot of good to appeal for their forgiveness
8142076 my question is why does the westerner think that if a man is a killer then hes going to remain a killer why is it so
8142077 we have developed a method that enables us to visualise fingerprints even after the print itself has been removed we conducted a study into the way fingerprints can corrode metal surfaces
8142078 for the first time we can get prints from people who handled a cartridge before it was fired wiping it down washing it in hot soapy water makes no difference and the heat of the shot helps the process we use
8142079 the procedure works by applying an electric charge to a metal say a gun or bullet which has been coated in a fine conducting powder similar to that used in photocopiers
8142080 even if the fingerprint has been washed off it leaves a slight corrosion on the metal and this attracts the powder when the charge is applied so showing up a residual fingerprint
8142081 the technique works on everything from bullet casings to machine guns even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun
8142082 kunde g till historien som den riktigt bra president han var utan som mannen som inte kunde l ta bli att ljuga om cigarrlekar i ovala rummet
8142083 and as i roll the ball i cry let me bowl or let me die
8142084 reject changes this property indicates that has any changes been made since the dataset was loaded or accept changes method was executed
8142085 well when ones lost i suppose its good advice to stay where you are until someone finds you but whod ever think to look for me here
8142086 now is the time to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8142087 if we can blast women to the moon we sure can elect one into the white house
8142088 thank you for all that you have done you have made me laugh and yes you have even made me cry but you have become a part of my life and i hope i have become a part of yours we have to keep going and we have to get going by electing barack obama as our next president
8142089 if they succeed in formalizing the contract during the abav fair in october would be very good within an alliance the tam would operate with its representation of 50 of the market for aviation in south america
8142090 residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
8142091 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
8142092 americans think that all afghans are terrorists and they send rockets and missiles against us
8142093 i myself buried more than 50 women and children are all of them terrorists
8142094 suddenly the infidels attacked and i lost consciousness when i came to i was in hospital and they told me that all of my family were dead and already buried was my two year old child a terrorist then am i not also a terrorist why did they let me live
8142095 according to our investigation there was not a single armed individual from the opposition in the area
8142096 karzai can keep his money i want my child will this money bring him back
8142097 the taleban were better than this puppet government and its masters
8142098 the taleban would at least distinguish between civilians and enemies but these thugs think everybody is their enemy
8142099 we are not helping the taliban nor were they in the village
8142100 we dont know why the coalition forces raided our village with blind eyes this does not make sense
8142101 we rode that wave in radio really well he said
8142102 this year the august month was clearly impacted by the olympics we expected that
8142103 but over that national advertising is certainly softer tighter more cautious than it was 12 months ago
8142104 relatively well and flagged cost cuts to adapt to the tougher environment
8142105 theres not a significant benefit in terms of a platform we can offer to national advertisers if were at three rather than five mr dorney said
8142106 it turns out the obama campaign and all the pundits had nothing to worry about
8142107 youve got to go out there and gut and skewer mccain
8142108 a lot of democrats are going to vote for mccain
8142109 i was with a lot of the clinton staff this afternoon and i think this is being built up to be much more than it really is
8142110 china mobile hy tyy mobiilimarkkinoiden nopeasta kasvusta ja kilpailijoiden puutteesta
8142111 by any yardstick it was another rough quarter for bank earnings but the results were not unexpected as the industry coped with financial market disruptions the housing slump worsening economic conditions and the overall downturn in the credit cycle
8142112 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen
8142113 some of them wanted to go out and smash all the cctv cameras
8142114 after this incident i realized that as soon as you step out of your door in this city you are under cctv surveillance
8142115 activists arent only followed by secret police in shenzhen anymore
8142116 they are concerned that they are followed everywhere by cctv cameras as well
8142117 they may not have face recognition technology on these cctv cameras yet
8142118 but they can easily be upgraded when the technology is available and no one will know
8142119 we already use face recognition technology in government offices and in the entrance to shopping malls in shenzhen
8142120 the technology is being upgraded day by day and the connectivity of different parts of the system to a central monitoring desk is also being constantly improved
8142121 we did mobile surveillance during the olympics for the ministry of state security
8142122 we are worried that the government is using the olympics as an excuse to import this technology from western companies
8142123 we are the national leaders in this type of technology
8142124 why didnt the government disclose the names of the people responsible and reveal the full details of the case
8142125 the troops engaged the militants with small arms machine guns and close air support killing more than a dozen militants
8142126 i would say some people thought we were going to die
8142127 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping
8142128 i sent my mum a text i love you and i am going down
8142129 for about half an hour no one told us anything we didnt know what was happening at all we were quite panicky
8142130 after half an hour we were told to take the oxygen mask off and then the plane landed and we were fine
8142131 we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew deploy their oxygen masks and they cant be making pa announcements while they have their oxygen masks on
8142132 one thing that can happen is that the outflow valve can fail and become open so all the air rushes out
8142133 a hole can appear because some damage was done which nobody notices and because of the constant stress of pressurising and depressurising the cabin it becomes bigger over time
8142134 what we had in these cases was jet jockeys deciding i am better than ryanair sops standard operating procedures we dont want anybody doing that
8142135 it has the youngest fleet of aircraft in europe and their maintenance organisation is first class
8142136 i broke a bottle over my head once because i couldnt open it
8142137 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8142138 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8142139 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8142140 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine

8142145 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8142146 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8142147 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president

8142158 choice is concerned about the level of access that pharmaceutical company drug representatives have to gps relative to independent sources of information
8142159 what 60 per cent of surveyed gps are telling us is that there arent enough sources of independent information available for them to be able to keep abreast of new drugs without receiving visits from multiple pharma company drugs reps

8142164 we got our hose but there was nowhere to plug it in to there was a few people out there but there was nothing we could do
8142165 there was a man trying to get back in because there was a girl lost in there

8142175 consumer voices have become more and more powerful and companies are aware of that
8142176 the staff are painfully slow almost meticulously and methodically slothful sometimes i would wait at the counter for up to three minutes thats 10 per cent of my lunch time while the staff moseyed and joked or swept or wiped at greasy spots here and there

8142178 several times i have gone to their stores at different locations and had nothing but snotty little girls give me attitude when i ask for a shoe size no smiles no thank you nothing

8142191 i support separation of church and state im just not very high on atheists
8142192 apparently its correct that no other reporters have ever corroborated the exchange

8142194 if mr grays client mr bush had not made those statements to me mr gray would have denied that they were said rather than trying to justify the statements if mr bush wanted to distance himself from the statements mr gray could have tried to create doubt about whether mr bush had made the statements

8142225 like an impeachment against the president its a political exercise what does she president gloria macapagal arroyo do she encourages the people to follow the constitution

8142235 comreg regrets eircoms decision to appeal and has decided that it must now act in the most practical and expeditious manner available to it and try to minimise the level of uncertainty in the marketplace arising from eircoms appeal
8142236 eircom has once again shown that they will use any and all means to protect their monopoly position in the market struggling under 4bn of debt the companys sole objective is to protect its cash flows from its legacy product suite
8142237 eircom clearly do not want competition and as a consequence are frustrating ireland incs desire to move with the rest of the developed world to have a digital economy

8142249 i was in a private area in the parents room behind the curtain and this cleaner just walked in on me and watched what i was doing
8142250 she told me the parents room was for parents and breastfeeding only and that i wasnt allowed to eat lunch in there
8142251 they told me that a little kid had been running around in the parents room and had briefly seen what i was doing and had complained to its mum she said
8142252 the mum then complained to security and the cleaner came in to inspect what i was doing they told me the complaint was that there was a topless woman eating her lunch in the parents room
8142253 its tough enough that i have to do this during my break but for a complaint to be made about me doing it is really upsetting
8142254 theres a public ignorance and theres still a lack of knowledge around breastfeeding and how it works she said
8142255 this mother was very humiliated and something like this could have seen the end of her expressing milk or working
8142256 its already very stressful and then to have someone complain about it is absolutely traumatising
8142257 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again http www

8142275 i am very happy to be back healthy playing well and winning the first round is always great fun
8142276 it was a good match to start off with i never saw my opponent before and that was the tricky part i thought the other guy played good for the pressure he was under
8142277 i thought i really served well and i moved really well for the first round thats positive for a start
8142278 but its been a hard year especially the beginning and it was difficult trying to get back into rhythm
8142279 i played really well on clay and grass but not so good early on in the hardcourt season i think the olympics doubles gold gave me a great lift and i am really inspired to do well here
8142280 but i feel the fans are really supporting me and telling me im still number one and still the best
8142281 ive got unbelievable support from the fans watching me and seeing people in the streets and stuff its kind of really nice
8142282 in recent times killer whales have become infrequent visitors to the nsw coast due in part to a reduction in their prey from historic whale and seal harvesting
8142283 it is the first time i have seen killer whales in the wild and i feel exceptionally privileged the killer whales looked fully grown they can grow up to ten metres in length weigh as much as six tonnes and live as long as 80 years they are truly remarkable creatures
8142284 there were a few seals in the water the day we saw the whales and i bet they were not quite as happy as us to see these magnificent creatures

8142351 a development company controlled by osama bin ladens half brother revealed last year that it wants to build a bridge that will span the bab el mandeb the outlet of the red sea to the indian ocean if this ambitious project is ever realized the throngs of african pilgrims who traverse one of the longest bridges in the world on a journey to mecca would pass hundreds of feet above the probable route of the most memorable journey in human history fifty or sixty thousand years ago a small band of africans a few hundred or even several thousand crossed the strait in tiny boats never to return the reason they left their homeland in eastern africa is not completely understood perhaps the climate changed or once abundant shellfish stocks vanished but some things are fairly certain those first trekkers out of africa brought with them the physical and behavioral traits the large brains and the capacity for language that characterize fully modern humans from their bivouac on the asian continent in what is now yemen they set out on a decamillennial journey that spanned continents and land bridges and reached all the way to tierra del fuego at the bottom of south america
8142352 attention if obama becomes presedant i will kill him myself make no mistake about it
8142353 it will be such a slap in the face of white america that millions of americans will join their movement and bring on the race war they have been waiting for

8142400 abm recognizing the enormous opportunities in todays global marketplace and its members needs is positioning itself to become the global b to b association

8142402 given the economic vibrancy that is india and with the opening of media to foreign investment
8142403 there are great opportunities for foreign media firms in the b to b sector to collaborate with their counterparts in india we have been in contact with publishers in india interested in best business practices and sharing their experiences with peers in their b to b markets taking a delegation of our publishing members from around the globe who have an interest in doing business in india will result in precisely that as bpa worldwide is the largest global non profit organization tasked with auditing media in more than 30 countries our incoming indian publishers may have an interest in reciprocating and visiting other countries in which they may have an interest in expanding their brands
8142404 i am particularly impressed with the enthusiasm expressed by indian publishers who have pledged full support by way of sponsorships
8142405 in fact i see 2009 as a turning point in indias b to b publishing industry

8142408 when you start getting higher draft picks and guys from other teams youve got to kind of look at it realistically that hey things might change
8142409 you know ive definitely had a great time here and hopefully i can have another good season here
8142410 i mean i know that i can help out and you always need depth so im just going to keep going out and giving it my all
8142411 you know i really cant pay too much attention to that kind of stuff thats not in my hands thats up to the coaching staff
8142412 i just try to go out and practice hard every day i just have to go out there and keep competing in practice and show them that im trying to get better you know im still a growing player in this league
8142413 hes got quick feet i think he gets to the ball quickly hes someone that can transition the ball well
8142414 you know you keep working with technique and some of the little things to improve his game but those are some of the things that hes done well in training camp that weve seen
8142415 ive never been the type to try to guess whats going to happen ive been doing it for a while and my thing is just go out there and play and let the coaches make the decisions
8142416 whatever decision they make you live with it and go on and hopefully if its not with a certain team you can move on to another
8142417 ive shown that i can still go out there and do what ive always done
8142418 ive always prided myself on that theres no dropoff with me a lot of people use age as an excuse but ive always said that the way that you look at a player is by how they play you dont look at the age
8142419 still need to see what they once were able to do
8142420 but im still feeling good like the last few years ive been here and i definitely feel confident that whether im here or wherever i might be i can still take care of business
8142421 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8142422 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8142423 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8142424 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8142425 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8142426 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8142427 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
8142428 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers
8142429 private insurance has been falling and public insurance definitely went up
8142430 the number of uninsured is considerably higher than when the president took office and in each year since then employer sponsored insurance has continued to diminish
8142431 i think its more like we are seeing a tide that i dont think anybody can easily fix particularly in the small business sector
8142432 what we need from washington is a realistic energy policy as well has health care for every working person
8142433 barack obama will invest in advanced manufacturing and green technologies
8142434 hell work to bring down the cost of health care and to make college affordable
8142435 the marks on the ground tell us that the plane hit the ground tail first and as a result the tail cone the end part of the plane broke off
8142436 i guess i did realize that when the plane was going to take off perhaps it was not going so fast
8142437 and i said to myself something is going on here
8142438 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling
8142439 there were children who had seats on top of them what i did was pull them out and set them aside so they were not trapped
8142440 i know a lot is being made of this but i think any human being at any time when people ask for help will give it
8142441 it is a contradictory feeling because i know that bodies are arriving back there and i will arrive intact
8142442 the law recognizes a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
8142443 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth
8142444 if youre talking about a true threat there has to be some evidence theyre not just talking about it or thinking about it especially in a drug induced state
8142445 i think that its something that at times the media tried to make more of
8142446 weve always watched them as we watch all the other groups
8142447 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out
8142448 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8142449 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8142450 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8142451 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8142452 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8142453 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8142454 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part

8142465 the progress perhaps even the survival of our society depends on the vitality of the amateur spirit in the united states today and tomorrow
8142466 both are by products of american wealth american progress but they can stifle the amateur spirit on which the special quality and vision of our american leaders must depend

8142470 we had to leave the house before it got worse
8142471 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
8142472 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play
8142473 youll never lose that urge to be out there but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again

8142479 we can see no reason why partial profile dna evidence should not be admissible provided that the jury are made aware of its inherent limitations and are given a sufficient explanation to enable them to evaluate it
8142480 for me personally it was a long night i pretty much screwed it up any way you can screw it up
8142481 my team expects me to get big hits and make big plays tonight i didnt do that
8142482 its not the end of the world if you dont win both
8142483 we talk about winning series all the time obviously tomorrows a big game for us just like today was
8142484 its obviously a different lineup but its still a very potent lineup
8142485 if we leave the strike zone hes going to chew us up
8142486 it just means i have a good sinker it means that i can throw it for a strike
8142487 i dont have any definite answers but it is a great opportunity to promote olympic sports
8142488 we won three medals in beijing but that also gives us a lot of responsibility to keep this momentum going
8142489 weve to give our athletes the best opportunity to perform well at london 2012
8142490 we need to have a goal how we want to do going ahead if we are to replicate our performance
8142491 they say a man is never satisfied and im not
8142492 next time i will try to get a gold medal in london
8142493 well keep doing it until we find the right way
8142494 i think the whole ballpark knew he wasnt going to swing but he put on a good show

8142499 also its worth noting that martinez coughed up five runs in two innings in the fourth and fifth inning when the mets had a seven run lead which is very very disappointing to say the least and its worth repeating again the mets did not score a run in the final nine innings of tonights game continuing a trend that will have to change if they intend on winning this division
8142500 ofwel wordt het een nieuw centrum ofwel een uitbreiding van een bestaand centrum maar hoe dan ook is het duidelijk dat een structurele maatregel als deze zich opdringt
8142501 my team expects me to get big hits and make big plays tonight i didnt do that
8142502 its not the way i drew it up when i came to the park today
8142503 it was the biggest pitch in the game he was in a position where one pitch could turn the whole game around if alex gets a hit there they have their lefty hitters coming up and they get the ball rolling

8142513 also swimmers tend to carry more of their bodyfat subcutaneously under the skin this is the bodys reaction to training in water because you are constantly losing heat to the water the body will try to protect against this by increasing the insulation near the skin fat if you are trying to get very lean regular swimming is not the way to go though it is okay for occasional use

8142515 the pilot relayed to the airport head that the hijackers do not want any negotiations and they have only one demand that the plane be refuelled to go to paris

8142528 the outsourcing trend is a salutory one for our globalized economy
8142529 outsourcing affords lawyers the ability to reduce their costs and often the costs to the client
8142530 there is nothing unethical about a lawyer outsourcing legal and non legal services provided the outsourcing lawyer renders legal services to the client with the legal knowledge skill thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation
8142531 at a minimum a lawyer outsourcing services should consider conducting reference checks and investigating the background of the lawyer or nonlawyer providing the services as well as any non lawyer intermediary involved
8142532 conducting them it is true that there are hardly any outright prohibitions or mandatory proscriptions in opinion 8 451 and certainly no new ones but there is plenty of advice
8142533 in some instances it may be prudent to pay a personal visit to the intermediarys facility regardless of its location or the difficulty of travel to get a first hand sense of its operation
8142534 when engaging lawyers trained in a foreign country the outsourcing lawyer should first assess whether the system of legal education is comparable to that of the united states
8142535 the lack of rigorous training or effective lawyer discipline does not mean that individuals from that nation cannot be engaged to work on a particular project what it does mean is that it will be more important than ever for the outsourcing lawyer to scrutinize the work of the foreign lawyers

8142539 tonight we come to the end of sixteen glorious days which we will cherish forever through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
8142540 in all my decades at the post this is the first event ive covered at which i was certain that the main point of the exercise was to co opt the western media including nbc with a splendidly pretty sparsely attended completely controlled sports event inside a quasi military compound we had little alternative but to be a conduit for happy olympics progressive china propaganda i suspect it worked
8142541 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
8142542 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose

8142544 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8142545 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8142546 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8142547 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8142548 i discovered really interesting things about what happens when people are mentally ill and how theyre treated afterwards

8142568 the book you are about to read will arm you with the knowledge you need to defend your network from attackers both the obvious and the not so obvious if you are new to network security dont put this book back on the shelf this is a great book for beginners and i wish i had access to it many years ago if youve learned the basics of tcp ip protocols and run an open source or commercial ids you may be asking whats next if so this book is for you
8142569 richard bejtlich has a good perspective on internet security one that is orderly and practical at the same time he keeps readers grounded and addresses the fundamentals in an accessible way

8142583 our ability to win each of the production classes at the past two races demonstrates the durability of these trucks in long distance grueling conditions
8142584 driving the entire race much more arduous than it appears

8142618 i think j j abrams he brought that energy lost certainly brings that energy we want to make our contribution and if anything we want to push it further and continue to do that so i think we put a lot of energy into making sure the action is going to continue to grow
8142619 were all big fans of heroes and obviously theres a lot of eyeballs that go into watching heroes i think its guys like chuck who like heroes so it seemed organic even though theyre very different shows its just fun to bea part of a show that had a breakout year last year and looks to have a great second season
8142620 thats a seminal performance of keanu reeves but i enjoyed that picture for me i feel connected to that picture because the ad staff that worked on that picture ive worked with for a long time and they would always tell stories about how difficult that shoot was a lot of nights so i remember the first thing i ever did im working with this staff coming off that movie and just feeling like i was actually in hollywood making a movie and it felt pretty cool it was a strong connection to johnny mnemonic
8142621 i just love that story thats what we connected on day one was just the peter parker hey im just a high school photographer or neo saying im just a guy who hacks computers chuck is saying look im really not fit to do what youre asking me to do and i think theres a bit of a quarter life crisis going on with kids that are 24 25 years old and we live in this big box culture that i dont know how many of us really believe that thats progress from the society perspective i always thought it was a little bit of a subversive but elegant commentary on is this big box culture really progress or is it a little bit ridiculous and truth be told theyre just more guys out there that look and feel and act like chuck than there are guys out there that look like tom brady and went to the super bowl for whoever so its just a way of connecting to a great many people and saying we understand and this is the voicing of the types people who are going to watch the show and its just an attempt to write and go with what you know and be honest

8142627 andrew chapman went on ebay looking for a good bargain and if he was a data thief he would have
8142628 the basic idea was that the current java runtime environment is simply too big and most programs require only a small subset of the functionality
8142629 the browser edition that i suggested would enable you to install exactly the subset of java that your particular program required but you would be able to download all of the other functionality on demand and thus be fully compatible with j2se
8142630 the feature did in fact get submitted as a proposal for java 7 under the name java kernel the idea being that you download a small kernel of java functionality which is in turn capable of downloading the rest of it
8142631 after going through all of the files in this fashion i was left with an extremely minimal jre that could run hello world and well thats about it but it at least provided a starting point building a working installer from this jre was itself a challenge because several of the files that werent necessary to run hello world were still necessary to successfully install the jre but i persevered and now have a fully functioning minimal jre
8142632 i also believe modularization of the jre is the solution not just for the size of the download but also for different other issues
8142633 the problem here is that java isnt just a browser based technology its a platform when i write a java applet or application i expect the platform to be there
8142634 linux and open source fans are always ready to stomp on microsofts proprietary programs so why do we not only give
8142635 for most of my life i been a football player not a public speaker
8142636 i really dont know how to say what i really want to say
8142637 i was ashamed and totally disappointed in myself to say the least
8142638 and i want to apologize to all the young kids out there for my immature acts what i did was very immature so that means i need to grow up i totally ask for forgiveness and understand as i move forward to a better michael vick the person not the football player i take full responsibility for my actions not for one second will i sit here and blame anyone else for my actions it was totally irresponsible i feel like we all make mistakes i made a mistake in using bad judgment and making bad decisions and those things just cant happen dogfighting is a terrible thing and i did reject it
8142639 we are saddened by the actions that michael has admitted to
8142640 and the actions that betrayed the trust of many people
8142641 i am not sure anyone really read this report including the author because over the last month apples enterprise numbers
8142642 the rear wheels of their forklift hit the raised surface at the entry door of the warehouse causing the forklift to rock and subsequently causing the server to rock
8142643 the damages sustained by t r systems was due to the poor workmanship and or defective packaging design and methods used by ibm
8142644 that was strong enough to support the substantial height and weight of the server
8142645 its an extremely grey area because i dont think the exemption was altogether clear
8142646 the idea of trying to use copyright to in a sense establish exclusivity in a service contract is going to be an interesting thing to watch
8142647 for the sole purpose of lawfully connecting to a wireless telephone communication network
8142648 i know that many of you have seen the blog posts about the xps m1330 delays but many customers are asking for details behind the inspiron delays
8142649 color options are the main source of delay on inspiron notebooks basic colors like black are easier to produce premium colors and finishes like we use on the inspiron models introduce complexity into the process and thats holding things up
8142650 producing smaller quantities is not the issue its mainly an issue of scale
8142651 well continue to work directly with suppliers to ultimately increase our production on color notebooks
8142652 dedicated sales and support resources specifically to address the customer experience issues that these delays cause
8142653 linux and open source fans are always ready to stomp on microsofts proprietary programs so why do we not only give
8142654 i will and i wont i wanna cry but mykella got up at 6 30 a m asking is it time yet
8142655 there is huge demand we are waiting for the consignment
8142656 the demand for gold coins has slackened as the retail buyer has realised that he can get it at a cheaper rate outside
8142657 this unusual rush and the delay long wait at the cash counter are because more people have started to swipe their credit cards to buy ornaments
8142658 customers buy the one and two gram coins to give away as gifts such purchases are close to the festival season such as diwali because of the steep decline in the price the demand has surged
8142659 what is the use of taking coins from a bank
8142660 the jeweller refused to entertain the commission and tax i found that i had lost rs 135 on every gram purchased

8142667 ok give me the run down of the games played
8142668 first in our mini olympics we played around the world at the basketball courts
8142669 yea but because we were using that plastic ball the wind blew it off the court
8142670 then we found some orange cones and put them on the track and did hurdles
8142671 the refs shouldve fought back like a 5 on 1 rumble
8142672 embrace the friction because although it might be unclear uncomfortable and sometimes painful the friction of life takes us somewhere farther than we could have went without it
8142673 right now teachers are usually filled with excitement about the start of a new school year
8142674 but because of the lack of a fair and equitable settlement that excitement has been replaced with disappointment
8142675 but if we are attacked we will fight back with the tools we have in our arsenal
8142676 our teachers will be compensated and they are receiving their benefits
8142677 this has to do with a gross mismanagement by the school board for not checking their wallets first before approving a teachers contract
8142678 our salary hasnt kept up with inflation at all were falling way behind
8142679 i dont trust the board the way they spend money this is all just another way to make up the deficit
8142680 the board has clearly indicated there is no interest in or stomach for raising taxes
8142681 if you take it away and close it im lost i dont know where to go
8142682 lets not take away one of the good things left in macomb county lets find a way to make it work
8142683 i understand where theyre coming from but i have to understand where the rest of my community is coming from as well
8142684 i wish we could roll back gas prices to 1955 when dad worked on the bridge but thats not going to happen
8142685 it costs you extra money to do anything today the price of fuel has certainly affected my other travel plans we dont travel like we did before it used to be that you didnt hesitate to go up to northern michigan but weve curbed it quite a bit this year its gotten so a tank of gas exceeds the cost of the motel room
8142686 while the overall travel numbers are down slightly from last year it is important to note that more michigan residents are spending their vacation dollars in michigan
8142687 i guess when it comes to gas prices my philosophy is that it is what it is and its out of my control
8142688 i feel so privileged to be the first class here
8142689 because it was in an old high school before coming to this feels like theyre really in college
8142690 the beauty of work depends upon the way we meet it whether we arm ourselves each morning to attack it as an enemy that must be vanquished before night comes or whether we open our eyes with the sunrise to welcome it as an approaching friend who will keep us delightful company all day and who will make us feel at evening that the day was well worth its fatigue
8142691 i spent my time visiting everyone in town and no one seemed to mind or worry for my safety
8142692 i had no equipment and just my mothers farm so i bought a tractor and put in hard work and a lot of time
8142693 in uniontown if you were looking for something to do you could certainly find it
8142694 the saturday night movies in the park were always a good time
8142695 during summertime these saturday night gatherings were an opportunity for kids to catch up with school friends
8142696 although my late husband ed was not involved in civic activities he never resented the time i was away and always supported me in my efforts
8142697 if not for his support i would never have been able to participate to the extent i did
8142698 ninety percent of the students felt being bullied caused social emotional or academic problems
8142699 when someone or a group of people upset or create a risk to another persons health and safety either psychologically or physically their property reputation or social acceptance on more than one occasion
8142700 we will not bully other students we will help others that are being bullied by speaking out and getting adult help we will use extra effort to include all kids in the activities in school
8142701 in 2005 studies of 1 500 internet using adolescents found that over one third had been cyber bullied and half of those admitted to cyber bullying others
8142702 we need u s taxpayers rebuilding america and putting people back to work
8142703 youd think that both parties would be scrambling to try to figure out how to move in a new direction but thats not what john mccain says
8142704 i dont think john mccain says these things because hes a bad person i just dont think he gets it
8142705 she has always been looking out for working families all throughout kansas city
8142706 shes no longer the mayor but shell soon be the congresswoman from the 6th congressional district
8142707 we cannot compete on a global level if we dont educate our children
8142708 we need to enforce our labor laws that are on the books and get stronger labor laws

8142712 she reported she was a voluntary patient and could go out and kill herself if she wanted to
8142713 i really had to kick it in gear and get myself together
8142714 either get up off the couch and do what im supposed to do or ill be shooting needles in me and that wasnt really a choice
8142715 in my lifetime ive had enough of needles and doctors ive had good doctors great doctors but id rather see them in the store to say hello
8142716 my thinking was well uva helped save my life this time and thats the least i can do to give back
8142717 then the journey just took this whole other turn where i met women out there who were out there just because they hadnt had cancer they knew somebody or they worked with people who have it and i just thought that was amazing that inspired me to really kick it up a notch to take care of myself a little better and i realized that to me the cancer was a blessing in disguise i guess because i really believe that when its your time to go youre gonna go whether youre overweight underweight youre going when its time
8142718 i was afraid to start because i knew how out of shape i was and im not exaggerating for me to walk 50 feet was hard
8142719 i hated to walk i hated to get up it just tired me i remember the first night we went out it was a quarter of a mile and i thought i was going to die it was just rough
8142720 they walk with me the whole time and just keep me going and keep me motivated a lot of times while were on the track ill say girls go ahead and run i know you want to run and theyll say no we dont we just want to walk with you and theyve just been excellent
8142721 she thanked all of us for keeping her going but it is she who keeps me going
8142722 she has been my motivation to start running again not only has she battled cancer but she is out there every night pushing forward for such a great cause i have nothing to complain about in the evenings except that it is hot but she never complains she motivates me to get out there and off the couch
8142723 it was really wonderful to know that all that i had been doing was not in vain
8142724 my thinking used to be i cant walk a mile so im not going to walk wrong answer no i cant walk a mile but i can walk two houses and back and if i did that every day then i can walk three houses and thats exactly what i did
8142725 you dont have to jump in and think youre going to be a marathon runner you just have to start i used to hate walking and now im just like i need to go for my walk i cant wait and it does become addictive
8142726 she was actually in the room along with the mother nicole robinson and devyn brewington and devyn had a loaded handgun in his waistband
8142727 they were selling packaging and using the controlled substances when we entered the residence
8142728 id like to thank the citizens of greene county for giving us information that led to the arrests
8142729 we sure had a great fourth especially after we picked up our morning papers and found that congress had adjourned the night of the third
8142730 but our enthusiasm was immediately dampened for the senate are to meet again monday so that means that prosperity will pick up only 50 percent
8142731 this country has come to feel the same when congress is in session as we do when the baby gets hold of a hammer
8142732 its just a question of how much damage he can do with it before you can take it away from him well in 18 months these babies have left a record of devastation
8142733 no sitting congress has passed fewer public laws at this point in the session 294 so far than this one
8142734 no mans life liberty or property are safe while the legislature is in session
8142735 give empirical credence to the association of an active congress with poor stock market returns
8142736 cafe increases are indeed needed and the industrys hard at work moving forward to meet that goal

8142784 la diferencia entre el acta acuerdo y la media sanci n de diputados est en que ser el tribunal de tasaci n el que determine el valor de aerol neas y austral evidentemente se realizaron las gestiones necesarias con marsans para acordar que ste ser a el nuevo m todo de valuaci n
8142785 no queremos hacernos cargo de la deuda pero tampoco apropiarnos de algo sin tener los mecanismos legales necesarios
8142786 la historia de aerol neas es la cr nica de un saqueo primero fue el grupo iberia y luego marsans
8142787 por qu no incorporamos en el proyecto de ley un cap tulo que defina la utilidad p blica del servicio aerocomercial se proceda a una expropiaci n y se deje claro que el estado no ser solidario con la deuda de ambas empresas
8142788 si jaime contesta ser su opini n ni el ejecutivo ni el bloque mayoritario el kirchnerismo se someter n a discutir una expropiaci n
8142789 primero habr a que determinar si es el estado el que debe pagar por las empresas y sus deudas o son ellos por el grupo marsans los que nos tienen que pagar a nosotros
8142790 no se ha cumplido ning n procedimiento jur dico para la aprobaci n del acta el secretario acaba de mentirnos en la cara est afirmando algo que no tiene nada que ver con la realidad los diputados separaron el acta acuerdo por considerar que es el instrumento que convalida el fraude y vaciamiento de aerol neas
8142791 podr tener mi verdad y usted la suya eso de decirme mentiroso no corresponde en todo caso usted tiene su opini n
8142792 el responsable de los estados contables es el secretario de finanzas a m no me compete el an lisis de los balances
8142793 no ha tenido impacto alguno en los trabajadores o el medio ambientes
8142794 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
8142795 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and viewers
8142796 we are now in government house and wont move until the government resigns
8142797 the government is not willing to declare a state of emergency because it will damage the atmosphere
8142798 we are now controlling most of the key government offices to prevent them from coming to work
8142799 today we declare a long long holiday for the government
8142800 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments and reconsider this irresponsible decision
8142801 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8142802 we have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8142803 things are deteriorating quite quickly where it will end up is very hard to say at this point
8142804 the russians strongly believe they are in the right on this
8142805 nobody in washington expected the magnitude of the russian response
8142806 if that pipeline were destroyed or controlled by russia global energy supplies would be even more vulnerable to moscows influence
8142807 he dont belong in political office or blacks dont belong in political office
8142808 the imitation of an action that is serious and also as having magnitude complete in itself
8142809 tragedy is a form of drama exciting the emotions of pity and fear its action should be single and complete presenting a reversal of fortune involving persons renowned and of superior attainments and it should be written in poetry embellished with every kind of artistic expression
8142810 incidents arousing pity and fear wherewith to interpet its catharsis of such of such emotions
8142811 because every president for the past century carried the state at least once missouri voters have chosen correctly each election since 1904 except for the 1952 race
8142812 this is not surprising coming from a candidate who believes
8142813 i believe that the technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8142814 it will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8142815 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8142816 a shockingly minimal endorsement of obama she mentions him ten times and every mention with the partial exception of one was a generic could have been applied to any of the other democrats that ran for president
8142817 im like a one eyed jack peeking in a seafood store i can look at you till you aint no child no more
8142818 i can look at you and tell you aint no child no more
8142819 you should have a 100 commitment to your sitting practice
8142820 i feel a need to confess that i often feel only half hearted about it
8142821 the world as it is just wont do we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8142822 going down into the sea with flames on one of the wings
8142823 going down into the sea with flames on one of the wings
8142824 the economy today is in much worse shape than it was a year ago
8142825 if i had to pick one place to ride out the recession of 2008 2009 it would be the state of texas
8142826 they are making choices of rent utilities gas in the car
8142827 when we talk with people we find that the need is more profound
8142828 we are seeing a little bit more increase in medicaid
8142829 it looked like it started to trend up in the last part of 2007
8142830 my concern is theyll start the project and run out of money halfway
8142831 then well have a monster a real mess on our hands
8142832 youre always worried about your project until you start turning dirt
8142833 i dont see the project stopping its just going to take a while
8142834 our goal continues to be the selection of a best value proposal by the end of this year
8142835 all construction projects the last five years have gone up 40 to 60 percent
8142836 this project was identified in late 2000 or early 2001 to move forward the project back then was a 400 million project this is a huge interchange
8142837 two or three people in my neighborhood work in the hospital district and theyre waiting for that train to come up
8142838 the commuters in my neighborhood they talk about the funnel all the time
8142839 3 333 times would be 333333333333333333333333333333333333333333 it never turns to nines
8142840 how a notation comes to be defined and how it is distributed are inherently political issues
8142841 when the republicans get started next week at their convention theyre going to let the attacks loose in prime time right out of the chute
8142842 id never advocate using untruths or distortions but we ought to be going at them blow for blow right here on this floor and real soon
8142843 lets give people a reason to be for us rather than just telling them not to be for the other guy
8142844 a lot of people dont feel like they really know obama yet
8142845 i think michelle obama did a pretty good job of helping them get to know him and she did that in a very positive way that was very well received
8142846 i think well take it to mccain id expect thats what joe biden will do when its his turn to speak
8142847 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8142848 republicans have no qualms about using swift boat ads willie horton and just about everything else while we just sit back
8142849 i think john kerry made a big mistake when he didnt hit back in 2004 were in here preaching to the choir when we ought to be preaching to the folks at home watching this on tv
8142850 i think arlington like so many cities is going to have to develop a crawl walk run philosophy on transit with such a history of enormous citizen resistance
8142851 that one factor alone has probably caused people to reconsider mass transit and how it could play a role in their lives
8142852 if they think its a failure they will say it needs more money or they will say its a success so it needs more money
8142853 no matter how the performance is the answer from a year from now will be it needs more money and to be expanded
8142854 possibly caused by sexual abuse when he was a child
8142855 i think his fiction and pictures are a projection of his horrific childhood
8142856 our economy everything in the nation and the world is very diverse so its just training
8142857 theyre behind in elementary school and the gap slightly widens when they get into middle school and it widens slightly further by high school
8142858 frankly we just dont allow students to accept the gap
8142859 we know where you are we accept where you are but heres where you have to be and heres what were going to do to help you
8142860 if they win this its going to be open season on every homeowner in fort worth
8142861 no one is going to want to rent my house no one is going want to buy my house
8142862 all of these items are still under discussion until we have definitive answers from the various parties involved in the meantime no permits will be issued
8142863 there are going to be a number of efforts to try to get the legislature to help us on this issue
8142864 yeah i got an extra room you can come live with me
8142865 the coach wants to talk to you in the locker room
8142866 you know this is being overblown yes we have some clinton delegates in our delegation but we think this is going to be all right
8142867 what we take away from that is we may be experiencing a slight fluctuation in our home values but as a general rule we are flat
8142868 were not seeing huge gains but were also not losing value
8142869 im going to take off my jacket and get a little less formal here
8142870 people are scared about the future you know something about this in this facility
8142871 i dont think john mccain says these things because hes a bad person i just dont think he gets it i dont think he realizes what ordinary americans are going through
8142872 if people tell you we cant afford it remember that were spending 10 billion a month on iraq
8142873 we need u s taxpayer money rebuilding america and putting people back to work
8142874 in a facility like this the possibility for injury is enormous
8142875 its pretty standard to lose an eye lose a limb lose a life were going to have a government that makes sure workers arent put at unnecessary risk
8142876 it seems to me that hes zeroing in on the common people and the people who need help the most
8142877 are you sure he will be able to do drama class dont you think he might fall off the stage
8142878 after the 21st after his inauguration youre still going to lose your house
8142879 i understand the love that black people have for obama i get that
8142880 i think the way you make the president a good president is when you make them accountable
8142881 qui i vostri nemici non possono creare nuovi pericoli essendo questo il mio territorio
8142882 fino a quando arriverete alle terre delloscuro le riconoscerete subito non temete a quel punto dovrete aprirvi la strada fino alla sua statua che rappresenta il legame delloscuro con questa dimensione distruggetela e avrete vinto ma fate attenzione prima di giungere alle terre delloscuro sarete vulnerabili agli attacchi di un suo vecchio alleato e non si tratta di evocare avversari che vi intralcino vi attaccher direttamente mirando alle vostre menti siate forti e saldi nei vostri intenti o perirete

8142885 no non se ne parla non avr la vostra forza o i vostri poteri ma far tutto ci che posso chiaro
8142886 non dispiacerti abbiamo avuto anche troppo tempo non trovi un giorno arriverai a capirmi vedrai tutto questo pu apparire stupendo allinizio ma alla lunga linteresse svanisce e ci si occupa sempre meno delle questioni mortali per cercare nuovi spunti di interesse in questioni talmente astratte da non poter essere espresse a parole abbiamo sbagliato a sottovalutare loscuro spero che almeno il nostro esempio serva a qualcosa
8142887 non temere trover di certo qualche modo per tenermi attiva
8142888 ero sicura che anche te sapessi siamo i soli vero tutti loro non sospettano minimamente il nostro fato giusto
8142889 quanto gli somigli comunque non posso dirvi nulla lo scoprirete da soli addio ora
8142890 direi che da lei non avremo altre informazioni comprensibile sar occupata a pensare a cosa magari gli resta da fare no

8142915 our challenge in the state of wyoming is representation in the state legislature long term
8142916 that means identifying potential candidates and developing those candidates like these three
8142917 the wyoming democrats are on the rise in the polls and financially and they realize they need to look at new members and ideas as well as what has worked in the past
8142918 suppose for example youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver for whom would you vote

8142951 a group of us were able to sit down and look at the history at brandeis and have the opportunity to fold that history into our campus and celebrate a time that martin luther king jr stood on this campus and not too many people know that
8142952 a colleague of mine had seen this particular series at an event somewhere in new england
8142953 she saw this and was really interested to see if we wanted to bring this to campus
8142954 along the way this program basically developed into something great with individuals from all parts of the university coming together to put this together
8142955 its pretty awesome that here it is the 40th anniversary of martin luther king jr s death
8142956 at age 23 my first job was at ebony magazine
8142957 that september the birmingham ala 16th street baptist church was bombed i had to do layout art work for ebony magazine on that crisis
8142958 after adopting an african american son he was three we adopted an asian american child his father was a black american soldier and his mother was vietnamese
8142959 adopting black children was like putting a lightning rod on top of our house for racism
8142960 i always wanted to do a series i knew very clearly that 2008 was the 40th anniversary of martin luther king jr s death so in september 2007 i took a gold leaf workshop in new hampshire
8142961 then i started the first painting in october 2007 there were 16 paintings done in 3 1 2 months i finished the last one two days before martin luther king jr s birthday in 2008
8142962 some of the things i used i found at the dump
8142963 i put broken pieces of stained glass and i gold leafed them into the painting
8142964 as a visual artist this is my way of expressing the sacredness of the lives that were lost

8143021 gro artigen frau michelle die eine formidable first lady sein wird
8143022 vor genau 88 jahren haben amerikas frauen das wahlrecht bekommen meine mutter wurde geboren bevor frauen w hlen durften und meine tochter hat daf r gestimmt dass ihre mutter pr sidentin wird
8143023 die demokraten wissen wie amerikas probleme zu l sen sind wir haben es schon einmal gemacht wir haben es unter pr sident bill clinton gemacht und wir werden es wieder machen mit pr sident barack obama
8143024 vergesst es nicht bevor wir weiter machen k nnen m ssen wir erst einmal an den start gehen indem wir barack obama zum pr sidenten w hlen
8143025 one day after class i noticed a student pick up a pile of five chairs and place them on a pile of two i wondered how many times this student chose the bigger heavier more troublesome pile of chairs
8143026 some people dont understand what we mean by philosophy they think its just discussion
8143027 the truth is its a rigorous and analytical subject you have to do it properly we dont discuss the meaning of life as a subject i think its more fundamental than maths or english
8143028 whether it is genetics war globalisation or environmental issues we need students to be engaged with these issues at a level that goes beyond superficial
8143029 philosophy helps students to think critically provide good reasons for being persuaded and explore their beliefs and values
8143030 no one is seriously looking at teaching philosophy in high schools in nsw
8143031 philosophy is actually doing very well in other states so its clear were behind in educational innovation
8143032 would the world be a better place if kids began learning philosophy in school yes it would result in a more inquiring society a society of thinkers who are rational and reasonable
8143033 i think philosophy will eventually be added as a high school subject throughout australia
8143034 its a matter of strengthening whats already happening in the curriculum
8143035 the problem in australia is a lack of qualified philosophy teachers
8143036 my interest is in distributing and collecting resources for the teachers already teaching and inspiring a few more to start
8143037 overall i think we need more teachers to bring philosophy into common ground and understanding how great the skills it gives students are its a system of understanding the world and what could be more precious than that
8143038 once my students realised that they were learning to reason they seemed to be shocked that it wasnt taught to them earlier
8143039 i think its one of the most important things in life a student even said to me that learning philosophy was like flipping a light switch inside his head its encouraging for me as a teacher to elicit this kind of response
8143040 i now question absolutely everything and i take everyones word as opinion and not fact
8143041 being able to distinguish the difference between those two i think is priceless learning logic and reason has helped me find my moral compass for a long time id been wondering why should i do what someone tells me and philosophy gave me tools to reason and find answers
8143042 far more likely to think things through now and ask for more detailed reasoning nothing forces you to ask yourself why quite like philosophy
8143043 im christian so i had very firm beliefs to begin with but i found that even then i was able to become more sceptical and think about things in a different way because i had learnt to reason philosophy is not a yes or no subject
8143044 what weve found looking at the final year exams of queensland students is that those who have studied philosophy perform better across all subjects
8143045 the result is kids who are critical thinkers and informed citizens its a big call to say the world would be a better place if everyone was taught philosophy young but what youd certainly get is a more informed and critical population which can only be a good thing this is incentive enough to see philosophy subject taught in other states
8143046 for far too long there has been no significant competition in the australian broadcast news monitoring market
8143047 with the launch of newscentres radio and television news monitoring service business and government now have a real choice in broadcast news monitoring
8143048 by harnessing this latest technology weve managed to really change the whole paradigm about the sort of costs that are involved in broadcast monitoring particularly
8143049 traditionally you had hundreds of people with headsets on all over the country listening to all the output
8143050 but once you use the software to take the sound and convert it into text then you create the sorts of efficiencies that enable you to provide very competitive pricing
8143051 two people died in the southeast when their houses collapsed
8143052 a strong energetic and far sighted civil defence protects our people and offers them more security from disasters than in the united states
8143053 gustav continues to represent a potential threat to oil and gas installations in the gulf region
8143054 given the current track for gustav and the expectation that it might enter the gulf of mexico this weekend we are making logistical arrangements to evacuate staff who are not essential to production or drilling operations
8143055 evacuations could begin as early as wednesday there is no impact on production at this time
8143056 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8143057 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8143058 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8143059 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8143060 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8143061 this is the story of america of women and men who defy the odds and never give up
8143062 knocked it out of the park she knocked it out of the state
8143063 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days they are awfully hard to tell apart
8143064 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8143065 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8143066 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president

8143108 as a kid before cable or vcrs i used to use an audio cassette recorder to tape tv shows
8143109 i did it just to get the audio tracks also there was a lot of comedy on records i would listen to monty python and older british comedy like tony hancock and the goon show
8143110 often people would describe their favorite moments on the tv shows or records
8143111 i would say no youve got it wrong i would start to mimic what was accurate on those shows i would enjoy the retelling of the stuff i would enjoy peoples reaction to it once i did it
8143112 what attracted me to the character of dana was that its a funny part
8143113 he is vulnerable which was a departure from characters ive played who are unlikable i am attracted toward dysfunctional people because i find them more interesting its a challenge to play someone odd or dysfunctional and still make the audience care about them
8143114 thats why we settled on the jeans and t shirt the hair was always kind of cool
8143115 it did make me a little nervous to play jesus
8143116 i did wonder whether writer director andy fleming was just trying to be provocative to annoy christians in a certain way or if it was just funny i wasnt quite sure but in the end i just did it
8143117 as a generalization i think americans are less repressed than british people
8143118 culturally people from america come from somewhere else so theres the risk factor within the personality that makes them more free
8143119 the challenge was how to make it interesting when hes so big and demonstrative without making it over the top especially in contrast with the other characters in the film who are more grounded
8143120 in this marketplace that is difficult because representatives sometimes dont know how to sell me i do so many different things but it satisfies me creatively
8143121 wake up america in 2001 the oil companies the war contractors and the neo con artists seized the economy and have added 4 trillion of unproductive spending to the national debt we now pay four times more for defense three times more for gasoline and home heating oil and twice what we paid for health care
8143122 if there was an olympics for misleading mismanaging and misappropriating this administration would take the gold
8143123 world records for violations of national and international laws we cant afford another republican administration wake up america
8143124 the insurance companies took over health care wake up america the pharmaceutical companies took over drug pricing wake up america the speculators took over wall street wake up america they want to take your social security wake up america
8143125 this administration can tap our phones they cant tap our creative spirit
8143126 wake up america this is not a call for you to take a new direction from right to left this is call for you to go from down to up up with the rights of workers up with wages
8143127 up with fair trade up with creating millions of good paying jobs rebuilding our bridges ports and water systems
8143128 up with education for all up with homeownership up with guaranteed retirement benefits up with peace up with prosperity up with the democratic party up with obama biden
8143129 yes i can confirm im pregnant its still early so im being cautious im resting as much as possible
8143130 ive moved down to the beach with tito i love being by the beach
8143131 ece services have put in place significant changes over recent years and these studies are showing it is starting to pay off by helping children to make a strong start in their learning
8143132 its too late now too many competitions i should just pack my bags and go home the internet is too complicated etc
8143133 why in the world would he be smiling at me
8143134 i dont think so he was probably smiling at someone behind me
8143135 can you believe mr brown is making us do all this work for just one chapter i cant believe this shit
8143136 it has been a contributing factor in that i havent been able to get out on the park but its more that i feel that the club is going in a different direction with the young players coming through and i dont want to be in their way
8143137 i still havent made a final decision about playing footy again next year
8143138 any equipment that has been used in freshwater has the potential to carry the alga particularly larger recreational equipment such as kayaks rafts and paddles
8143139 much more drastically needs to be done at airports and ports its not coordinated and its not seen as being serious enough
8143140 the bottom line is that once it gets in here theres no way to control it
8143141 it will run rampant particularly in tasmania because it loves cold water that runs fast
8143142 australian biosecurity officers are not doing nearly enough at points of entry
8143143 anglers are a high risk pathway but bushwalkers boots are of interest to quarantine officers for various reasons so i dont think its fair to say they are not getting reasonable attention
8143144 and my understanding is that the import requirements for didymo are being reviewed and that includes looking at different treatment options
8143145 there is no change in the itinerary bangalore will host the first test
8143146 the atp board can confirm that it has regrettably accepted a petition from the bangalore open to suspend the 2008 event due to the local promoters security concerns

8143221 as prime minister of this country i take responsibility for all the news in this country on the economy good news difficult news and bad news
8143222 our attitude is simply this you can engage in that sort of political language as mr howard as prime minister did or you can engage in some very direct conversation with the australian people about the challenges we face
8143223 they are challenges which are substantial on the basis of the legacy of 12 years of neglect inherited from those opposite they are substantial because of the 10 interest rate rises we had in a row
8143224 i believe the best way forward is to be upfront with the australian people about the challenges they face rather than plucking statements out of the air as those opposite are so given to do
8143225 its important to remember that there are real people and families behind these statistics
8143226 the new census figures are a reminder of how important it is to ensure that all americans have access to affordable health coverage
8143227 nearly 46 million americans have no health coverage and remain vulnerable to financial disaster if a serious illness or accident strikes
8143228 this report shows how critical medicaid medicare and schip are in providing a safety net to americans who cant afford health coverage especially during tough economic times

8143245 this is the story of america of women and men who defy the odds and never give up
8143246 knocked it out of the park she knocked it out of the state
8143247 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days they are awfully hard to tell apart
8143248 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8143249 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8143250 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8143251 any equipment that has been used in freshwater has the potential to carry the alga particularly larger recreational equipment such as kayaks rafts and paddles

8143255 australian biosecurity officers are not doing nearly enough at points of entry
8143256 anglers are a high risk pathway but bushwalkers boots are of interest to quarantine officers for various reasons so i dont think its fair to say they are not getting reasonable attention

8143258 our participants experiences show that offering staff a life of meaning can be a powerful tool for recruitment that appeals to both millennials and baby boomers
8143259 we give our employees and recruits numerous opportunities to hear about the organizations values and discuss whether we are living up to them this has made a huge difference for us in attracting and retaining a workforce

8143318 a national program would be the best way to do it
8143319 most other states and some of the territories have been more successful and committed to serving children
8143320 i would even go so far to say under the right circumstances well even transport these individuals to the proper care facility
8143321 its a question of how do we allocate those resources for the best results
8143322 i am still waiting to hear from the opposition parties said pandikar adding that the ec was very efficient notifying him of the by election result within a short period of time
8143323 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8143324 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8143325 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8143326 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern

8143329 it will be a means of communication in the gay community as well as with the romanian public as a whole
8143330 some people are frivolously playing with fire on all sides
8143331 for this very reason we in the west should not react unwisely
8143332 to be driven by ones emotions at this point would be wrong
8143333 the conflict in the caucasus is in danger of escalating further if we are not careful the whole security apparatus in europe will be unhinged with unpredictable consequences for us all
8143334 we will not solve conflicts if we do not talk to each other
8143335 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he
8143336 every moment of this video is a wtf moment thats why its so good
8143337 its time to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8143338 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
8143339 we try to entertain in a way that some people will think was funny and some wont but we had no malicious intent
8143340 im happy with the kind of films i am getting and yes the sex symbol tag that i had got after julie is fading
8143341 i wouldnt have done khatron ke khiladi even if i was offered it because it wont challenge me creatively
8143342 i am comfortable doing about four films a year unless i get burnt out and totally exhausted i think i will continue doing so
8143343 i will be happy if in the morning i get a birthday wish call from my production people instead of a work call but no party plans yet
8143344 when a wednesday which addresses itself to an issue thats close to mr modi as a politician was ready i wanted him to watch it i called him and requested him to do so
8143345 mr modis counter request was tell me the story in two lines i told him he immediately agreed then his staff got into action and a date was set
8143346 it the screening went off fabulously let me tell you media perceptions of mr modi are completely wrong he is misunderstood because he is outspoken he is a politician destined for very big things the good thing was he came with no prejudices and he brought his entire ministry and government machinery with him
8143347 its very important for us actors to come forward and help a film thats done with sincerity of purpose and has got a message behind it
8143348 tahaan is a kashmiri fable its got some interesting actors but the best performances come from child actor purav bhandare and then the donkey who plays his companion all others in the cast have to take a backseat to the duo
8143349 my three films in two weeks offer me a chance to play completely different characters
8143350 theres so much new talent and appreciation for them sachin yardi who has directed c kkompany and neeraj pandey who has directed a wednesday will be major names after their films release
8143351 biggest loser has been my lifes biggest challenge and victory to get so many contestants to lose as much as 40 kg at a go was no mean achievement so yeah im bringing back the show but id leave the practical execution and the nitty gritty to my co producer rahul aggarwal
8143352 for me giving the full time attention and focus that the show requires is not possible at the moment
8143353 but yes id be there to give the show all the boost it requires we want the second innings of biggest loser jeetega to be bigger and more decisive than the first part otherwise theres no point in encoring the show
8143354 this film is our tribute to the brave people of mumbai who stood up to the extreme attack of terrorism on 7 11 and emerged almost unscathed
8143355 so we decided not to rush it there was no point the film has 8 9 new young actors all straight from the streets and trained by my director joy augustine through intense workshops the film needs rigorous promotion because its got no stars but every one of those 8 9 faces is a potential star
8143356 it was a film on international terrorism and we wanted it out in the week of 7 11 when the train blasts shook mumbai but then post production took longer than we expected
8143357 it is also about giving genuine users an assurance and protecting them
8143358 we are aiming for very high passing rates in the future
8143359 the education process is very important and once they start using genuine software and see the benefits for themselves they will appreciate it
8143360 that kind of cost of losing the data is a lot more than the initial savings of rm50 or rm60 so that is very important
8143361 microsofts wga initiative is one method that bodes well towards realising this behaviour among malaysians
8143362 we would like to see acts of piracy and disregard for others ip eventually diminished as msc malaysia promotes respect for innovation and creation of ip
8143363 at the same time this also provides assurance to local software providers that their made in malaysia innovations will be protected and that they are able to the reap the rewards of their development and ideas that go into such innovations
8143364 a high alert has been sounded in the jammu due to the infiltration of three terrorists from across the international border security forces have launched a massive search operation in the entire area
8143365 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories
8143366 of the 2 519 batsmen who have taken the crease in 131 years of test cricket bradman stands alone and untouched

8143390 the markets for mainstay mems actuator products like inkjet heads and digital light processor dlp chips from texas instruments finally have passed the baton to mems sensors to drive the next growth wave in the market
8143391 the new wave is partly founded in the rapid rise of consumer electronics applications such as motion sensors for gaming laptops and digital still cameras mobile handsets will also be a strong area with mems sensor revenue in this area to rise at a 22 9 compound annual growth rate cagr to reach us 925 million in 2012
8143392 the consumer electronics and mobile communications fields are much more dynamic than the previous mainstay markets for mems i e inkjet heads diverse industrial applications and automotive uses
8143393 existing companies have a great opportunity to ride this wave and new players have a chance to address a relatively open market however deep r amp d pockets are essential to compete in this area and the companies that will succeed will be those that bet on and invest in building dedicated mass production facilities
8143394 i felt every little bump as i was carried up the steps because of my back it was jarring and was very painful i was also very embarrassed
8143395 there was nothing it was as dead as a dodo
8143396 i pressed the button next to it for help but had no answer i kept pressing it for 45 minutes until a man answered it
8143397 he said he was in the main cardiff control room and that the lift was not working there was no sign or notice on the lift though and it looked like all the staff in the station had gone home
8143398 in the meantime i had called the police who then put me through to the railway police british transport police
8143399 my partner had also run up the steps and over to the other side of the platform to ask a train driver there if he could help and he rang the main rail control
8143400 by this point i was freezing and i was getting more and more stressed and panicking because i needed to have morphine for my back
8143401 finally there were sirens and an ambulance came i was put in a metal chair and two paramedics a man and a woman had to struggle to carry me up 45 to 50 steps with my partner struggling to carry my wheelchair and luggage
8143402 it took them a good half an hour and it wasnt easy because i weigh 12 stone
8143403 im thinking about other people say you had someone in an electric chair theres no way someone could lift that

8143411 our landline billing system as of now works on the conventional technology and we are unable to give a customised offer to subscribers but very soon all that will be a thing of the past
8143412 one of the advantages of the new billing system is that one single bill could be generated for an entire corporate house and the payments also accordingly be made from any where in the country
8143413 in addition we will be able to offer various tariff plans to landline customers on the lines of mobile tariff plans

8143416 is there anyone else involved and how real was this plot or was it just a discussion fueled by people with delusions of grandeur and too many drugs
8143417 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8143418 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8143419 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8143420 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8143421 i really didnt expect it to be that big of a margin it was the runoff i didnt have four years ago
8143422 i feel like i have been vindicated now from that
8143423 i feel like i have a mandate from the voters and i am going to try to live up to that mandate
8143424 i think the voters were ready for change and i have been told i did a good job for my eight years i served in district 5
8143425 but i dont have a problem with peoples votes i am very pleased with what this board has accomplished in the last four years i think we are headed down the right track this community is in a position to accomplish great things if they will work together and work smart
8143426 i have a race in november but i have had a ton of democrats tell me they wished they could have voted for me in the primary so we feel good about the general election
8143427 we are looking at all opportunities that would add value to the company
8143428 the costs were going up and there was a delay in the delivery of the two rigs
8143429 weve tried to do advertising to the general public about the importance of not sharing spit because thats how this thing has spread
8143430 its part of their belief system that this is not the right thing to do
8143431 this outbreak at least got going because it took hold in an unimmunized community so they are the ones who are really sitting ducks for infection
8143432 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8143433 and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8143434 they know the strength of america remains the greatest force for good on this earth
8143435 the confusion here is between john mccains rhetoric that no ones love of country should be questioned and the reality of his campaigns daily false personal and detestable attacks on sen obama
8143436 but its not a surprising tactic from john mccain who is offering four more years of karl roves playbook to distract from his plan for four more years of george bushs failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8143437 but confidence in oneself and confidence in ones country are not the same
8143438 he suggested that the end of the cold war proved that there was quote
8143439 for the sake of our own security and the defense of our values in the affairs of the world american leadership is critical while we have our share of critics around the world when people in the oppressed nations of the world need support and solidarity and hope they look to america
8143440 when they talk about our country it is not with distrust or disdain but with respect and affection
8143441 they do not resent or resist americas democratic influence in the world they thank god for it
8143442 of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8143443 if i catch senator obamas drift then our failure to
8143444 and if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
8143445 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
8143446 to promote stability and peace america must stand firmly on the side of freedom and justice the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8143447 in the old days we believed mr or mrs right would show up someday but as we remain single for much longer and are far more mobile the chances are more remote
8143448 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8143449 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8143450 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8143451 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern

8143462 we took him over to dr hillman to get checked out when he was about a month old and we found out he was a boy but we were already too attached to him we couldnt give him up dr hillman warned us that male pigs stink so we had him neutered
8143463 we have a customer who comes over from mobile every week and brings him cookies
8143464 one day recently he was lying on his side i guess sleeping
8143465 but then for a week or two i didnt see him out at all i gave them a call on my cell i told him i was one of the biggest fans of the pig and was concerned that i hadnt seen him recently
8143466 they said he was inside with the air conditioning on and was just fine its such a fun lift to see him out there enjoying himself
8143467 at 11 30 hell be out here rooting and grunting at my leg
8143468 his favorite food is onion rings but hes hell on krystal burgers and french fries and he loves pizza crust too
8143469 one of the things that bothers me is that it was a low turnout
8143470 in the final analysis many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy they are thus part of the market failure that is climate change
8143471 reforming energy subsidies opportunities to contribute to the climate change agenda
8143472 whereas fossil fuel subsidies are an example of a blunt policy instrument perpetuating old and inefficient economic models the new clean development mechanism cdm is an example of a more intelligent market based mechanism that is fostering the transition to a modern green economy
8143473 hillary can tell us to do whatever to support obama and unify but its not going to happen
8143474 when we leave here im afraid there will be a false sense that we have the unity to all march in line thats not going to happen
8143475 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8143476 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8143477 this is not an enviable position to be in for obama
8143478 cant live without the clintons but living with them is not a walk in the park either
8143479 these are the people in the end who will either decide that obama is fit to be the president or not
8143480 barack has said all the right things he needs to say them more often
8143481 hopefully starting tonight there will be a higher level of enthusiasm and commitment in support of sen barack obama
8143482 its time to unify and work together we have to unify the party
8143483 the clinton campaign thinks theyve done all they can and the obama campaign thinks so too
8143484 but if we dont come out of this convention running and functioning like we should then its everybodys fault
8143485 the interior minister has instructed us to restore law and order as soon as possible
8143486 those who have been following us on astv and radio for long please come out and join us here to make a sea of yellow at government house
8143487 a social trend in which people use technologies to get the things they need from each other rather than from traditional institutions like corporations
8143488 on ebay you buy from other people instead of a store craigslist lets you find a job or a babysitter without searching through newspaper want ads linux is an operating system created by engineers working together rather than depending on a big company like microsoft
8143489 anybody can put up a site that connects people with people if its designed well people will use it theyll tell their friends to use it theyll conduct commerce or read the news or start a popular movement or make loans to each other or whatever the site is designed to facilitate
8143490 and people have always rebelled against institutional power in social movements like labour unions and political revolutions
8143491 theres a social network for every audience linkedin targets working professionals piczo is popular with young girls brazilians join googles orkut while hi5 and bebo dominate in europe
8143492 these problems are generally caused by a combination of the proliferation of duplicate and often inconsistent occurrences of data and the misrepresentation and misunderstanding of the data caused by the lack of a cohesive enterprise wide data definition regime
8143493 because of the move away from centralised mainframe systems the proliferation of separate departmental information systems and the availability of personal desktop computing power including the provision of spreadsheet and database software
8143494 it involves unsupervised learning i e without targets or outputs and is more closely related to statistical clustering techniques than it is to methods such as regression analysis it offers a rather novel approach to clustering
8143495 the transformation does not involve the same space as the data but rather a two dimensional grid of nodes the idea is that a set of input data or input vectors is subject to a topology preserving transformation such that they are effectively described by the prototypes the som equivalent of clusters
8143496 for example he might learn the target companys domain names and the range of ip addresses it uses he might perform a port scan to see what ports are open on a target system
8143497 the hacker could pretend to be a representative of the service provider or a government agency
8143498 its going to be around a four month recovery rather than six months
8143499 the good news for leeds fans is that they can expect to see him ready for game one next year for the rhinos
8143500 well take the ducks out in a boat about 100 yards offshore and let them go
8143501 theyll come toward the shore because weve checked the tide schedule and know when the tide will come in the first one to make it to shore is the winner of a 500 gift certificate
8143502 if i go out an say im leasing a rubber ducky for the rubber ducky derby thats boring
8143503 we give a 4 000 scholarship every year to a navarre high graduating senior and we have the mardi gras parade in navarre on feb 21
8143504 when we party we do but we dont use fundraising money for that
8143505 eh ayo kita makan di sana ada potongan 10 kalau bayar pakai kartu kredit x

8143507 london mit es handele sich um drogen der klasse a das hei t harte
8143508 some multinational companies and zionist cartels produce new kinds of diseases to export their drugs to other countries
8143509 contrary to the commercial approach that is prevalent in the world drug markets our approach towards the production and export of drugs is humane
8143510 we should try to produce drugs that are needed worldwide to help the humans
8143511 saya merasa hal yang paling sulit adalah meyakinkan jurusan atau fakultas dan dosen lain mengenai masa depan e learning ini harus sabar dan terus menerus beriklan beberapa dosen juga mengalami kesulitan dan takut menggunakan moodle pemberian dokumen petunjuk penggunaan bagi dosen mungkin bisa membantu

8143522 senatorul john mccain este colegul i prietenul meu i a servit ara noastr cu onoare i curaj
8143523 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8143524 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8143525 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people
8143526 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain
8143527 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days its awfully hard to tell them apart
8143528 we need all those who knocked on doors and made phone calls or me and got into arguments from time to time to work as hard for barack obama as you worked for me
8143529 my superiors were not happy the local bishop was not happy but they did not understand me either
8143530 now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
8143531 we have to draw more attention to the world of nuns who are often not sufficiently appreciated by society
8143532 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god

8143542 the demand for undocumentated labor in the us economy is structural
8143543 these workers are members of our community who have lived in the us many years raised families and contribute positively to our society
8143544 they deserve to be free to remain united with their families and to have access to full citizenship rights

8143548 attacks on vulnerable populations in sudan are deplorable and violate international law
8143549 this really is a catastrophe people are being killed while the world just watches
8143550 independientemente de si votasteis por m o por barack ha llegado el momento de unirnos en un nico partido con una nica causa estamos en el mismo equipo y ninguno de nosotros se puede quedar al margen
8143551 m s estancamiento econ mico combustible caro y ejecuciones hipotecarias mas guerra y menos diplomacia

8143554 in many cases its not the dog its the owner
8143555 sometimes teens get pit bulls to add to their sense of manliness i dont know if theyre good owners we only find out when theres an attack
8143556 a lot of these owners dont know they can do it better they dont know how they dont have the resources
8143557 for those of you who are wondering what just happened so am i
8143558 i just made a giant masterpiece for all of the greatest worlds newspaper nerds
8143559 barack il mio candidato e deve essere il nostro presidente
8143560 da mesma maneira que nos unimos para empurrar nosso time que levantamos bandeiras e faixas de protestos que gritamos amor eterno da arquibancada e com a mesma f que pedimos para que os jogadores d em sangue por nosso corinthians podemos abra ar essa causa
8143561 and theres just one word that i still believe and its
8143562 frantic action packed tower defense game in a gritty sci fi setting
8143563 i can confirm im joining spurs right now im getting my visa and as soon as it is ready i will fly to england to sign a contract
8143564 everything has happened very quickly so i could not even say goodbye to my team mates
8143565 i could not decide if i wanted to go to england at first first yes then no
8143566 the only thing that stopped me from leaving was my family b
8143567 ive put my time into education its time to move on
8143568 we have been recognized locally regionally and as well as at the state level for the achievements of our students
8143569 our whole reason for being there not seeing them on a daily basis of course working with an excellent and very competent faculty and staff
8143570 all life is a repeating pulse and ebb and surge of motion
8143571 i felt every little bump as i was carried up the steps because of my back it was jarring and was very painful i was also very embarrassed
8143572 there was nothing it was as dead as a dodo
8143573 i pressed the button next to it for help but had no answer i kept pressing it for 45 minutes until a man answered it
8143574 he said he was in the main cardiff control room and that the lift was not working there was no sign or notice on the lift though and it looked like all the staff in the station had gone home
8143575 in the meantime i had called the police who then put me through to the railway police british transport police
8143576 my partner had also run up the steps and over to the other side of the platform to ask a train driver there if he could help and he rang the main rail control
8143577 by this point i was freezing and i was getting more and more stressed and panicking because i needed to have morphine for my back
8143578 finally there were sirens and an ambulance came i was put in a metal chair and two paramedics a man and a woman had to struggle to carry me up 45 to 50 steps with my partner struggling to carry my wheelchair and luggage
8143579 it took them a good half an hour and it wasnt easy because i weigh 12 stone
8143580 im thinking about other people say you had someone in an electric chair theres no way someone could lift that
8143581 first of all we would like to apologise to the disabled customer and carer for the inconvenience and distress this caused them
8143582 first sergeant hatley then made the call to take the detainees to a canal and kill them
8143583 so the patrol went to the canal and first sergeant sgt first class mayo and i took the detainees out of the back of the bradley lined them up and shot them
8143584 we then pushed the bodies into the canal and left
8143585 even if we are not the target we just might suffer because of the impact of a blast nearby
8143586 bmo continues to be tripped up by a variety of complicated investment products demonstrating that financial markets continue to sour
8143587 the canadian economy is expected to grow by the slowest rate since 1992 and the housing market is cooling but he jumped in at the end of a conference call with analysts to inject a note of optimism
8143588 it is good news that housing starts are at the low level where they are and at some point people are going to come out of rental housing and move back into purchased housing
8143589 i think that it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8143590 attention if obama becomes presedant i will kill him myself make no mistake about it
8143591 it will be such a slap in the face of white america that millions of americans will join their movement and bring on the race war they have been waiting for
8143592 are white people ready to accept a black man as president of the united states what we would hope is that we would look at him not as a black man but as a citizen of this country
8143593 de blir ett fantastiskt lag f r v rt land
8143594 after saawariya sonam was looking forward to working with ranbir everything was fine till she was told that deepika was also in mera jahaan thats when she said no
8143595 we had approached sonam there was a meeting with her and we told her that ranbir kapoor was part of the project and deepika was under consideration but sonam said she did not want to do a two heroine project at this stage of her career it was her call thats fair enough
8143596 she cited the two heroine reason because deepika was the other actress she did not even want to hear the script after hearing this
8143597 i normally dont talk about my personal life but his name is raj kundra we met a year ago
8143598 for the next 18 months ive got my hands full with work so i cant really think of marriage yet but after that i definitely want it to culminate in marriage and of course im dying to have a family at least two children
8143599 i spoke to her and we exchanged numbers it was really emotional i can only ask people to pray for her because there is a lot of power in prayers
8143600 i thought i served well and really moved good for the first round i went on a good roll at one point there
8143601 this take a little bit of pressure off me because i know a little more about where my game is at
8143602 i dont know much about him i only know what he looks like
8143603 i watched him play a few points on tv today i expect him to be a similar opponent who plays from the baseline
8143604 the olympic gold in doubles gave me a great lift
8143605 it really inspired me and i hope to use that to do well here
8143606 it is a special memory it was unbelievable to listen to the national anthem and share that moment with my friend
8143607 there is nothing embarrassing it happened in my life and only i know how much trouble i faced i should say it was the most difficult phase of my life i had no other option but to approach my friend dayal and he ended up producing a movie which went on to break records at the box office
8143608 fate played a very bad role in our lives but we worked it out together when he was in the dumps i helped him and when my movies started failing at the box office he came to help me out with the direction weve suffered together and weve won together
8143609 rani and lara came together as guests on the show they were very chirpy with each other but as soon as they walked on the stage to face salman the equation changed
8143610 it was evident that salman was more comfortable talking to rani than lara even his jokes and his one liners were directed towards her lara looked like she was out of place
8143611 salman and lara got along really well in partner but after that they really havent interacted much lara was in the running for the lead role of main aur mrs khanna but she wasnt too happy with the way she was dropped from the film that remained a sore point between the two moreover lara is also part of srks billoo barber and as sallu detests anyone who has anything to do with srk as of now could also be a reason
8143612 sallu and lara were hanging out a lot during the partner period in fact it was salman who recommended lara to david dhawan for the film there was even buzz that the two were more than just friends
8143613 no matter how far we go theres always something to remind us of where weve been
8143614 this match is going to help me because it was so challenging
8143615 i was missing a lot of match practice so i got a tough one today
8143616 the d90 delivers incredible imaging performance and control setting a new standard for its class this marriage of outstanding still image performance and hd movie clip capacity represents the dawn of a new age for d slr cameras the d90s handling characteristics and long list of features are sure to deliver the photographic experience that nikon photographers have come to expect from nikon engineering

8143618 when we began planning ie8 we took a hard look at our customers concerns about privacy on the web
8143619 many users are concerned about so called over the shoulder privacy or the ability to control what their spouses friends kids and co workers might see
8143620 if you are using a shared pc a borrowed laptop from a friend or a public pc sometimes you dont want other people to know where youve been
8143621 you know as well as i do this feature is built for porn
8143622 it sounded like a crazy idea but i do a lot of bike riding
8143623 i feel better doing a 100 mile bike ride than after 100 rounds of golf i dont like to play 18 holes of stroke play i like doing things out of the ordinary the weather cooperated im having some soreness but i enjoyed it
8143624 sunscreen and a good pair of golf shoes are important when you play 100 holes
8143625 i thought if anybody could pull it off chris would do it
8143626 everybody was told in the pro shop what i was going to do
8143627 no one had a problem with it the club members are great monday is the least busiest day and the kids were back in school
8143628 i think ill get somebody to go with me and play
8143629 next year well try to help somebody with the idea
8143630 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8143631 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8143632 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8143633 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8143634 as long as we dont get any more heavy rains i feel golfers will be getting a good course this week and into the holiday weekend
8143635 the really only time we get in trouble with water is when the creek gets out of its banks
8143636 we were unable to mow fairways and roughs for five days
8143637 the bunkers did wash but have all been put back there was no standing water on any holes
8143638 with the exception of a very heavy storm two saturdays ago most of the rain was slow and steady and more helpful to the courses than anything
8143639 i have never enjoyed playing golf in the rain but the better prepared you are the better you will play
8143640 i highly suggest buying a good pair of rain gloves they really allow you to hold onto the club in wet rainy conditions
8143641 other than that do all that you can to keep your equipment as dry as possible keep plenty of towels in your bag and always carry an umbrella
8143642 the two suggestions i can give are to move up a tee box so you will play about the same yardages into the greens with less roll
8143643 also to hit the ball solid whether it is wet or dry you must make contact with the golf ball first and the ground second when the grass is wet the water gets in between the club and ball and can cause the ball to squirt sideways
8143644 everybody thinks grooves are for spin but what they dont know is that they also work like treads on tires moving water away from the face of the club keep your clubs clean
8143645 who could write a better bio the band themselves or the kids that love them
8143646 no self respecting woman should wish or work for the success of a party that ignores her sex
8143647 if you cant say something nice dont say anything at all
8143648 son keep your mouth shut and let people think you are a fool rather than opening it and removing all doubt

8143757 and in 2008 he mccain still thinks its ok when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8143758 john mccain has never believed in renewable energy and he wont make it a part of americas future for all his talk heres the truth john mccain voted against establishing a national renewable energy standard he voted against tax incentives for renewable energy companies and for all his talk of drilling he refused to endorse a bipartisan effort to expand domestic oil production because that bipartisan proposal would end tax breaks for big oil
8143759 after eight years of a white house waiting hand and foot on big oil john mccain offers more of the same at a time of skyrocketing fuel prices when american families are struggling to keep their gas tanks full john mccain voted 25 times against renewable and alternative energy against clean biofuels against solar power against wind energy
8143760 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8143761 and guess who voted with president bush 90 percent of the time sen john mccain
8143762 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future

8143764 at a time when america should be working harder than ever to develop new clean sources john mccain wants more of the same and has taken more than a million dollars in campaign donations from the oil and gas industry now he wants to give the oil companies another 4 billion in tax breaks four billion in tax breaks for big oil

8143791 once our warehouses were full we had to rent a badminton court just to store them
8143792 it has cost us a lot of money to launder and store the clothes so we decided it would be better just to auction them
8143793 just a week after the quake we told people to stop sending us secondhand clothes but they kept on coming
8143794 people would just dump them on the ground and leave we received as many clothes in the three months after the quake as we had in the past three years
8143795 ondanks russische waarschuwingen stonden westerse landen te trappelen om de illegale onafhankelijkheidsverklaring van kosovo te erkennen
8143796 wij hebben altijd gezegd dat het daarna onmogelijk zou zijn om tegen de abchazi rs en de osseti rs en tientallen andere groepen wereldwijd te zeggen dat niet goed voor hen is wat goed is voor de kosovo albanezen in de internationale betrekkingen kun je niet een regel hebben voor sommigen en een andere regel voor anderen
8143797 i dont know how other players feel about it but as a pitcher i dont like it i think that they overshot the mark by far just because in a yankee game i guess somebody didnt get a homer
8143798 its happened thousands of times its part of the game its the beauty of the game i mean mistakes are made its not like anybody wants to make mistakes especially the umpire theyre doing the best they can and thats always enough the best that they can do in the end is always enough if its not enough for certain hierarchy or whatever i think thats a shame
8143799 a lot of people would love to be doing those gigs
8143800 sorry but i am not that girl the responsible one the one you thought could write more than a dumbass blog post im just not
8143801 there was black smoke everywhere dead bodies on the ground and people panicking and helping to transfer the injured to the hospital
8143802 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the cease fire deal
8143803 if it goes in the direction of aggravating relations its not going to be our choice
8143804 i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances
8143805 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8143806 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners if they want to preserve good relations with russia in the west they will understand the reason behind our decision
8143807 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8143808 dramatically escalated the crisis between russia and the rest of the world
8143809 the only place these people want to be is home and they cant go home because of what has happened to them and because of the situation that the russians have caused
8143810 there is a lot to do here and my job in all of this is to make sure that the international community does not forget what is going on here
8143811 and more importantly that we make sure to continue to bring light to the difficulties and the future difficulties that may occur particularly with a hard winter coming
8143812 we will take our orders from sheik osama bin laden because we are his students

8143844 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration

8143858 in the fall of 2002 bush and his white house were engaging in a carefully orchestrated campaign to shape and manipulate sources of public approval to our advantage
8143859 the phony bush lied story line distracts from the biggest prewar failure the fact that so much of the intelligence upon which bush and rockefeller and everyone else relied turned out to be tragically catastrophically wrong
8143860 in my experience the great majority of cases of actual politicization successful politicization are invariably subtle
8143861 the desire to avoid the unpleasantness of putting unwelcome assessments on the desks of policymakers
8143862 false information from the iraqi national congress inc affiliated sources was used to support key intelligence community assessments on iraq and was widely distributed in intelligence products prior to the war
8143863 a source who may have information related to the alleged sale
8143864 a contact with excellent access who does not have an established reporting record
8143865 this unremarkable report was disseminated but because it produced no solid answers there wasnt any urgency to brief its results to senior officials such as the vice president
8143866 in many ways we were prisoners of our own history
8143867 the u s rush to war against iraq marked the worst intelligence scandal in the history of the united states

8143871 ya hubo una tormenta fuerte el 11 de agosto cuando se registr una muy importante entrada de humedad y calor

8143878 the marks on the ground tell us that the plane hit the ground tail first and as a result the tail cone the end part of the plane broke off
8143879 i guess i did realize that when the plane was going to take off perhaps it was not going so fast
8143880 and i said to myself something is going on here
8143881 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling
8143882 there were children who had seats on top of them what i did was pull them out and set them aside so they were not trapped
8143883 i know a lot is being made of this but i think any human being at any time when people ask for help will give it
8143884 it is a contradictory feeling because i know that bodies are arriving back there and i will arrive intact
8143885 uh i heard your friend had beef with my moms second cousin
8143886 its not the best war but its the only one we have
8143887 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8143888 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8143889 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8143890 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8143891 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8143892 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8143893 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
8143894 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers
8143895 private insurance has been falling and public insurance definitely went up
8143896 the number of uninsured is considerably higher than when the president took office and in each year since then employer sponsored insurance has continued to diminish
8143897 i think its more like we are seeing a tide that i dont think anybody can easily fix particularly in the small business sector
8143898 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8143899 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8143900 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones

8143906 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8143907 the law recognizes a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
8143908 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth
8143909 if youre talking about a true threat there has to be some evidence theyre not just talking about it or thinking about it especially in a drug induced state
8143910 i think that its something that at times the media tried to make more of
8143911 weve always watched them as we watch all the other groups
8143912 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out

8143963 this is a tragedy for one of our rare native species
8143964 it highlights the importance of protecting native crayfish populations and preventing the spread of diseases between river catchments
8143965 we may never know how the signals were introduced into the afon llwyd but there are measures that people can take to help prevent crayfish plague spreading to other important white clawed crayfish sites
8143966 the environment agency is concerned about any deliberate or inadvertent introduction of this large non native crayfish which has the potential to seriously threaten the smaller native species

8143998 any equipment that has been used in freshwater has the potential to carry the alga particularly larger recreational equipment such as kayaks rafts and paddles
8143999 much more drastically needs to be done at airports and ports its not coordinated and its not seen as being serious enough
8144000 the bottom line is that once it gets in here theres no way to control it
8144001 it will run rampant particularly in tasmania because it loves cold water that runs fast
8144002 australian biosecurity officers are not doing nearly enough at points of entry
8144003 anglers are a high risk pathway but bushwalkers boots are of interest to quarantine officers for various reasons so i dont think its fair to say they are not getting reasonable attention
8144004 and my understanding is that the import requirements for didymo are being reviewed and that includes looking at different treatment options
8144005 i would even go so far to say under the right circumstances well even transport these individuals to the proper care facility
8144006 its a question of how do we allocate those resources for the best results
8144007 were just trying a pilot program to see if it works

8144014 im glad that theres something like this at rice because i think we need to be more environmentally conscious
8144015 from what i see it clearly went over the line
8144016 from my seat i thought it wasnt but i when i talked to him a little bit he said he saw it as going out once i got back to the dugout everybody said they saw it go out we still need replay no question
8144017 he kept the ball low and mixed it up real well and had command of all his pitches when hes doing that you just try to battle we hit some balls hard and some were caught those days happen
8144018 his command was good and breaking ball was good i thought he attacked the bottom of the strike zone really well with his fastball and thats what we want wandy to do
8144019 i was holding it here near the waist and i moved it up here in front of his face
8144020 i feel more comfortable every pitch i threw was better my breaking ball my fastball
8144021 i threw a bad pitch but it was hit well it was good pitch it was a strike but it was bad location
8144022 i just hoped the umpire was going to make the wrong call
8144023 i was going to play it off like it was a hit but i could see it from my perspective and he made the right call you cant take it away from him
8144024 a national program would be the best way to do it

8144044 having seven freshmen come in its a lot different in terms of showing them the ropes and making sure they knew how everything was supposed to go
8144045 they worked really hard and all of them got noticeably better from the time they came here at the beginning of the summer until the end
8144046 its kind of a big deal especially because i was the captain of the team
8144047 its a huge honor for me to raise the trophy at the end its a great experience to be the best in europe
8144048 it was a lot of responsibility for me but i was ready to take it because i think being captain on the national team is the biggest honor you can get
8144049 i hope i can help this team washington state in some way like i helped my national team
8144050 if im gonna be captain or not that doesnt mean anything im just trying to help this team the same way i helped my national team
8144051 i felt confident in my shot just my offense and my defense are doing much better than last season

8144096 we need to address issues such as pensions services to enable older people remain living in their own homes transport and employment policies
8144097 aib receives the largest cut as it has the highest proportion of property development exposure we estimate that approximately 17 of aibs loan book is to property developers the vast majority of this is irish property developers
8144098 we cut our 2009 10 estimates for anglo and boi by 8 16 primarily due to increased loan loss expectations
8144099 we have attempted to break down loan losses for the irish banks by asset class and geographic location we expect the largest loan losses to stem from property development in ireland
8144100 allied irish bank is the most exposed while bank of ireland is the least however bank of ireland has significant exposure to uk specialist mortgages where we also expect sharply increasing loan losses
8144101 we estimate that between 60 and 70 of allied irish banks loan book is directly exposed to the property sector about 17 consists of property development we reduced our estimates for allied irish bank by a third predominantly due to higher loan loss estimates
8144102 we believe they make up less than 5 of the total loan book while this is encouraging and leads us to forecast somewhat lower loan losses the large exposure to uk specialist mortgages is a cause for concern uk specialist mortgages make up 13 of its loan book
8144103 in addition we expect it to experience somewhat lower losses in its developer loan book due to cross collateralising
8144104 i dont know him personally but ive seen him around
8144105 someone told me hes been arrested hes a white male hes dressed in the kind of muslim wear
8144106 hes a muslim convert but he doesnt attend a local mosque
8144107 they kept the community informed and they looked after the families of people taken into custody
8144108 the local residents are quite happy with the way the police have treated the whole incident
8144109 the community has to wake up to the reality that terrorism is a real threat
8144110 people in lancashire have to come forward and provide any evidence
8144111 we want to align our technologies so as to provide a better service to our customers around the globe we are an ingredients and flavours business based globally and we are now at a stage where we have to align these technologies
8144112 lots of clubs dont have a great history but he created history at nottingham forest we were there a few weeks ago for a friendly and you still felt as though brian clough was there
8144113 i wouldnt say i hear his voice echoing but you just feel hes made a massive mark at the club
8144114 the great managers are remembered for what they leave behind rather than what they are doing at the time you look at forest and what hes left behind and you see a brilliant stadium great history trophies the way they play football
8144115 im pretty sure he wouldnt like whats going on in the game now with fitness coaches taking over and prozones weights dieticians pasta and bananas i dont think he would be too keen on all that
8144116 he was a football genius and the stuff he used to come up with at forest was so simple i try to take that into what we do here
8144117 but obviously he could spot a player and one that could plug into what he was trying to do what he won at forest and derby was brilliant but he had his bad times as well at leeds where it didnt quite work out
8144118 he bought many players at forest who were shown the door after a couple of months such as john sheridan they were really good players but he made decisions he felt were right for the club
8144119 i look back on my time there and he was very hard with me but very fair i have no problems with the way he treated me
8144120 the next time i saw him he said i thought you were going back and he handed me a boarding pass and off i went a couple of days early and he fined me a weeks wages
8144121 he was the manager and had every right to do what he wanted he knew i was a young lad and that the people had done something to me that wasnt nice he knew i was wrong to react but he understood it as well
8144122 i was young i was raw in my time at forest he probably thought i was the last person who would become a manager
8144123 but he was an absolute genius certainly the best manager i played under without a shadow of doubt
8144124 would he survive today most definitely he would stand up to the challenges although he might have been reluctant to move with the times in terms of the scientific side of things and i bet alex ferguson would tell you the same
8144125 brian clough would have survived of course he would he would have adapted and made his mark at whatever club he was at because he knew his football
8144126 towards the end a lot of people were very critical of him which was a disgrace hes sadly missed
8144127 he never talked to me about his leeds days but then again i hardly had a conversation with him a lot of senior players at forest were scared of him
8144128 if they heard he was in the building they would literally go hiding but maybe because i was young and playing in the first team i never felt that fear of him just unbelievable respect
8144129 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8144130 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8144131 i know that the fsln sandinista front wants to eliminate me

8144133 our preference is that it would not be played in tblisi and we would have an expectation it may not be there but it is up to what the fifa sub committee decides
8144134 its very difficult we have a thousand fans coming in we have the players coming in and there are issues around the insurance of players and everything that goes with that the reason why we looked for a neutral venue is so it is safe to play the game
8144135 georgia has been through difficult times i understand that i have spoken to the chief executive and the president and they understand our position totally they understand completely why we want a neutral venue and im hoping by this afternoon we have confirmation of where that venue is

8144605 these simulations show that young stars can form in the neighbourhood of supermassive black holes as long as there is a reasonable supply of massive clouds of gas from further out in the galaxy
8144606 the crucial element was the modelling of the heating and cooling of the gas as this tells us how much mass is needed for part of the gas to have enough gravity to overcome its own gas pressure and thus form a star
8144607 that the stars currently present around the galaxys supermassive black hole have relatively short lifetimes of 10 million years suggests that this process is likely to be repetitive such a steady supply of stars into the vicinity of the black hole and a diet of gas directly accreted by the black hole may help us understand the origin of supermassive black holes in our and other galaxies in the universe

8144623 after eight years of george bush you might be surprised that a texan is president of planned parenthood
8144624 after all there arent many people eager to see the words texan and president in the same sentence ever again
8144625 made me feel real good like ann is still living on through her daughter and granddaughter
8144626 these are human beings its our duty to protect the care for them
8144627 there is a tremendous amount of people in this county who participate in equestrian activities
8144628 now they have to go to conroe or katy for events
8144629 they can raise as much special interest money as they want its a bottomless pit of dirty money
8144630 its no wonder thousands of employees in the oil and gas industry as well as every other major industry overwhelmingly support senator cornyn since rick noriega thinks theyre dirty and is trying to put them out of business
8144631 so while the member of congress cant use all that money for his own campaign he can still know who the people are who write very large checks
8144632 in a body of 535 people there arent 300 leaders
8144633 its just another way to raise money a way to support higher ambitions
8144634 i would even go so far to say under the right circumstances well even transport these individuals to the proper care facility
8144635 its a question of how do we allocate those resources for the best results
8144636 when i got that hit to left field that guy started saying all kinds of stuff
8144637 hey i hit the ball hard people who know baseball know the guy rangers left fielder marlon byrd made a nice play i had no chance to make it to second i can deal with that
8144638 the next at bat when i hit the ball to left field he said the magic words
8144639 something personal about my family i dont deal well with that thats enough right there
8144640 i understand who i am and the money that im making
8144641 i understand that im hitting 250 and the fans are expecting a lot more than theyre seeing but the word he said trust me anybody would want to go there
8144642 its clear that iraq poses a major threat its clear that its weapons of mass destruction need to be dealt with forcefully and thats the path were on i think the question becomes whether we can keep the diplomatic balls in the air and not drop any even as we move forward as we must on the military side
8144643 i think all of us including the fans have come to appreciate the human element in calls
8144644 i like the idea the way theyre going to use it but i wouldnt want to see it spread to other plays or calls
8144645 i think theyll listen to you a little but not for long
8144646 to me its a little like when they began showing radar gun readings on the pitcher on the scoreboard
8144647 at first no one wanted anyone to know how their pitcher was throwing now its one of the first things everyone looks for its become part of the game
8144648 we were in kansas city when ron washington called me and when the manager calls you at 12 30 p m you dont know if its good or bad
8144649 he told me i was going to minnesota and i just said youve got to be kidding
8144650 then the general manager called me and i asked who they got for me and he said a young pitcher named hamburger i said what no fries or milk shake just me for a hamburger
8144651 i caught a plane got here by 6 p m and got to pitch in a 2 1 game in a pennant race does it get any better than that
8144652 since i arrived on campus andy has been a great leader for this program on the field in the locker room in the classroom and done everything we asked that we ask of all student athletes from where he was a year ago he has changed his life around 180 degrees and as a coaching staff we have seen the positive impact he made on this program
8144653 a team thats already thin in a lot of areas just takes another hit
8144654 ive said that its a total advantage to us to have them in our first ball game
8144655 because we began preparing for oregons complex spread offense a little bit earlier and that gives you a big advantage rather than if you played them the second game youd have four days to work on their scheme
8144656 the fact that were playing a rival a pac 10 game i think were going to find out very quickly what kind of team we are
8144657 i think sometimes you might play somebody where even after the game you dont know how good you can be were going to know i think this is a test for both teams
8144658 we get a chance to be one of the first teams to play and in a league game that is nationally televised
8144659 its a great opportunity for us to play a home game early and find out where our football team is
8144660 theres no question that it will be fun to run out of the rose bowl tunnel
8144661 but that will be short lived because as i look to the other side there will be the tennessee volunteers and we all know what kind of program they are you cant get too lost in the moment or youre going to get it rained on your head very quickly
8144662 i think it went back to your winter conditioning when you knew you had a conference opponent to open the season
8144663 it kind of changes the entire focus theres no margin for error weve got to get out of the box pretty quick
8144664 there is still work to do on the bill clinton front
8144665 now john mccain is my colleague and my friend he has served our country with honor and courage but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8144666 we will be making agreement on individual school performance reporting a condition of the new national education agreement to come into effect from the first of january 2009
8144667 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8144668 when people move interstate one of the things they want best and quickest is readily available comparative information on the schools within that geographic region
8144669 the argy bargy on this is going to significant with the states we accept that but we intend to prosecute this
8144670 we should not tolerate underperformance it damages students irreversible it fails their families and therefore it must change
8144671 where it is clear that individual schools are not up to the mark we need to be prepared to invest money and effort to lift their performance
8144672 the package will also include measures to recruit the nations most talented graduates into teaching and place them where they can make the greatest difference
8144673 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom
8144674 extraneous spending is easy to cut out by having cash
8144675 the slowdown in the u s economy has had an effect on our growth in the u s
8144676 people do use cash as a way of disciplining themselves
8144677 the kids really have no concept of living on a budget
8144678 i definitely use mostly credit cards its easier to keep track of
8144679 i spend about the same every month and i pay it off every month when i use cash i dont know where it goes
8144680 i remember talking to a young woman about 10 years ago who said she only used credit
8144681 i thought to myself why would you use a credit card to buy food its gone before you pay for it
8144682 i go through 100 in cash so often i dont want to carry all that money
8144683 this way i wont have the bills coming in later
8144684 were in the process of buying a home so were trying to save
8144685 we know from a century of northern resource exploration that there is gas in the beaufort sea oil in the eastern arctic and gold in the yukon there are diamonds in nunavut and the northwest territories and countless other precious resources buried under the sea ice and tundra
8144686 use it or lose it is the first principle of arctic sovereignty
8144687 i guess you could call it romanticizing el paso but i guess its also being naive and hopeful that things will change you could blame it on straight ticket demo voting or you could blame it on el pasos love for voting to keep political families in office one way or another or both i do hope we stop spinning our tires in the mud and get ourselves out of it only time will tell

8144712 creo que puedo hacer cosas importantes con mi equipo s que no somos profesionales al 100 por ciento nos cuesta mucho esfuerzo poder reunir al grupo y entrenarlo ellos a pesar de todo hacen el intento de trabajar a doble jornada hay veces que las cosas no se pueden dar como uno quisiera sin embargo por momentos pudieron mostrar la capacidad de buenos futbolistas que son

8144731 things have now evolved to the point where linux subsystems are set up so that you can use a removable device in the same way you use them in windows
8144732 even though linux has reached well beyond its school project roots linux users tend to be soapbox dwelling fanatics who are quick to spout off about why you should be choosing linux over windows
8144733 there are just as many help sites lists forums for windows as there are for linux
8144734 10 sets of rambling disjointed thoughts full of fallacies and assumptions on both sides

8144750 it would be an exaggeration to say that russia finds itself in international isolation writes
8144751 russia has clearly found itself in a vacuum no one has supported moscows actions although for various reasons
8144752 russia has demonstrated that it is able and willing to use force outside its borders in order to defend its national interests this leaves neighboring countries faced with the question of how to ensure their own security

8144795 i looked at it with my team and we thought we could identify it down to the level of genus but we had no idea what the species was

8144811 bureaucratic solution that has failed wherever it has been tried overseas
8144812 anyone calling for the national broadband network to be separated is calling for telstra to be separated given that the national broadband network is essentially a major upgrade to part of telstras existing network
8144813 telstra has made it 100 per cent clear that if further separation is required it will not build the national broadband network overseas experience has already proven that separation does not work it increases costs reduces efficiencies limits future innovation and most importantly kills off investment

8144822 dalam politik tidak ada kawan atau lawan abadi selain itu keterlibatan mereka dalam kasus itu sudah selesai secara hukum
8144823 mereka yang mengaku reformis sekarang sikapnya juga banyak yang sama dengan orde baru keras kepala dan otoriter jadi akhirnya semua tergantung orangnya dengan komitmennya

8144836 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
8144837 history despite its gut wrenching pain cannot be unlived but if it is faced with courage it need not be lived again
8144838 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8144839 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8144840 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8144841 little children it is the last hour and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming even now many antichrists have come by which we know that it is the last hour they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that none of them were of us
8144842 who is a liar but he who denies that jesus is the christ he is antichrist who denies the father and the son whoever denies the son does not have the father either he who acknowledges the son has the father also
8144843 those who do not acknowledge jesus christ as coming in the flesh this is the deceiver and the antichrist
8144844 it was in antioch that the disciples were for the first time called christians
8144845 shout a full throated shout hold nothing back a trumpet blast shout tell my people whats wrong with their lives face my family jacob with their sins

8144848 you shall leave your name as a curse to my chosen for the lord will slay you and call his servants by another name
8144849 he found him and brought him back to antioch they were there a whole year meeting with the church and teaching a lot of people it was in antioch that the disciples were for the first time called christians
8144850 this is the only way you can receive this kind of anointing
8144851 ya allah berkahilah kami pada bulan rajab dan bulan syaban dan sampaikan kami ke bulan ramadan

8144858 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8144859 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8144860 nothing to improve the prospects of peace in the caucasus
8144861 the warfare began aug 7 when georgia launched a barrage targeting south ossetia
8144862 envisioned using computer game technology to provide the public a virtual soldier experience that was engaging informative and entertaining
8144863 we entered into a marriage of game industry technical expertise and army core values and applied that to something really meaningful
8144864 americas army looked nothing like the other games it had high quality graphics animation and sound even though the game was free to players i think everyone expected it to be junk they were all surprised
8144865 soup to nuts virtual experience within which to explore entry level and advanced training as well as soldiering in small units
8144866 we have virtually taken our players through boot camp and airborne training and even introduced them to the special forces
8144867 through americas army players have learned about rules of engagement lifesaving laws of war and army values
8144868 the stronger the family the stronger the army because strong families improve combat readiness
8144869 it has words in it that resound today in terms of resilience in strength
8144870 this is not welfare not gimmes but things that army families depend on to be able to persevere through this persistent conflict
8144871 most of programs are funded by our global war on terrorism supplemental dollars
8144872 they will be sustainable because weve taken about half of those dollars and put them into the base funding program in the long term we wont retain an all volunteer force unless we retain army families
8144873 only 3 percent of those returning have lost limbs and yet that is who the people think of when they think of severely wounded veterans the rest of them have multiple injuries
8144874 most of them have post traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury and these are the ones who may decide to get out of the military
8144875 so we wrap our arms around them and their families to provide some of them counseling and to help them get job skills
8144876 we have a university that will broadcast classes into their room at walter reed at no charge so they can go ahead and get their bachelors their masters they will get life skill credits in the college and we do everything to get them employable and help to find them jobs
8144877 were finally getting after our geographically dispersed soldiers before we really couldnt conceive of how to use the technology to get to our reserve national guard engineer district rotc recruiting battalion soldiers and families
8144878 were doing that with military one source and what we call the army integrated family support network which will be unveiled in october
8144879 so were doing things like getting counselors in the schools to help the military child with transition
8144880 the hardest thing in the world the first day of school is who are you going to sit with at lunch they made sure that they would assign a buddy to go with them just knowing things like this as a mother was a huge thing for me that made a tremendous difference in the ease of moves for my children and thus for my husband and me
8144881 its the army taking responsibility not for just its on post schools but for where 70 percent of its families live and thats off post
8144882 a soldier will write a check payee freedom and put down an arm or a leg or his life but he will not risk his children ever
8144883 when you realize how important children are to our ncos and our young officers they will not risk their childrens education or their safety security or future
8144884 so schools are a huge deal to our army families
8144885 with each new mission lopez created a legacy that will be hard to replace
8144886 this is exactly what these men were trained to do
8144887 the speech was too good it just proves that she should have been the presidential vice presidential nominee

8144907 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8144908 a disturbing and undemocratic overreach not in the interest of either management or labor

8144914 we have developed a method that enables us to visualise fingerprints even after the print itself has been removed we conducted a study into the way fingerprints can corrode metal surfaces
8144915 for the first time we can get prints from people who handled a cartridge before it was fired wiping it down washing it in hot soapy water makes no difference and the heat of the shot helps the process we use
8144916 the procedure works by applying an electric charge to a metal say a gun or bullet which has been coated in a fine conducting powder similar to that used in photocopiers
8144917 even if the fingerprint has been washed off it leaves a slight corrosion on the metal and this attracts the powder when the charge is applied so showing up a residual fingerprint
8144918 the technique works on everything from bullet casings to machine guns even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun

8144956 star wars the clone wars brings an entirely new look and feel to star wars by moving it into animation we wanted to use technology that would live up to the high standards of lucasfilm and selected autodesk maya as our animation platform for both the film and tv series we chose maya for its creative tools extensibility and large user base maya is the backbone of our global production environment enabling us to seamlessly share work between our united states based creative team and our production studios in asia

8144960 this is actually a process thats not being done by anybody else
8144961 weve done some early small shoots with it but doing 40 half hours with the digital puppetry and live animation system has really proven to be an exciting breakthrough for our company

8144965 we actually direct the animation as if its live action using a director who calls out shots and takes just like a live action director
8144966 when we have a director in here he can set up the shots and move the cameras around and we can actually do take 1 take 2 take 3 until the joke and the timing of the scene is exactly right

8145034 our goal with the new jets stadium is to create the best home field in football and provide a range of seating options

8145040 its very exciting you try not to get too excited about it
8145041 ive played in a lot of big games before so im not going to try to build that up in my mind too much
8145042 im just going to go out there and do what we do im going to go out here and have a good practice today well get to do some philly prep at the end of practice and just take it one pass play at a time
8145043 i know ill get to play i dont know how much but i know im going to get the opportunity to play
8145044 we were running our four minute offense and they called a pass play down the field
8145045 in that situation you dont want to throw the ball away because then the clock stops and were trying to run the clock out you just get what you can and take the sack in that situation
8145046 i feel like i can make progress just from observing from the sideline each game i feel like ive gotten a little better whether ive played or not
8145047 it sounds funny but thats a testament to the coaching the sideline operation coach brian daboll and coach noel mazzone on the sidelines are always kind of helping me out even though they know im not playing
8145048 i cant try to do what he does in practice because physically what he can do with the football is amazing

8145058 we are hopeful of doing a cash neutral deal given that the lease costs are coming down and newer aircraft are available in the market which leads to lower operating costs more fuel efficiency
8145059 so even though we may currently carry old aircraft in our fleet with low lease rentals these can be replaced with newer slightly more expensive aircraft with far better operating efficiencies
8145060 mamyta yo te qiero y estoy contigo no estas sola
8145061 the roar of the greasepaint the smell of the crowd
8145062 i know theres change and progress and all that kind of thing
8145063 but this is a very emotional time i was here when this building opened up i saw it open
8145064 they let me make the last pick of the 1975 draft
8145065 i picked ohio state te mike bartosek in the 17th round he didnt make the team but he wasnt the first player cut
8145066 george sauer was my tennis partner gerry philbin was the first jet who came to my house we used to have a kitchen at the complex and bake joe namath apple pies
8145067 weeb had so much time for everybody hed walk around every part of the building and talk with everyone he made you feel important no matter who you were
8145068 just because it didnt work out here doesnt mean its not going to work out for you and you need to keep pursuing your dream and your passion this is by no way saying that things are not going to work or that you cant do it its just not going to work out here right now
8145069 you want to see a good formula for success in the nfl take a look at jerricho cotchery
8145070 youre not eating the same foods your great grandma used to cook
8145071 we each have the potential for positive change in our lives
8145072 i feel like i got hit by a truck i am just tired all the time
8145073 the american people are not supportive of the continued involvement of our fighting men and women in an unfocused mission that lacks an objective and exposes them to further harm we should bring the troops home as soon as we have secured the release of any prisoners of war and received a full accounting of our missing in action the president is making a terrible mistake if he thinks that six more months of the continued presence of our forces in somalia will result in anything but the deaths of more american military men and women there is significant sentiment in the senate to bring the troops home i am certain that once senators and congressmen hear from their constituents the american people they will demand the expedited end to the united states role in somalia
8145074 our landline billing system as of now works on the conventional technology and we are unable to give a customised offer to subscribers but very soon all that will be a thing of the past
8145075 one of the advantages of the new billing system is that one single bill could be generated for an entire corporate house and the payments also accordingly be made from any where in the country
8145076 in addition we will be able to offer various tariff plans to landline customers on the lines of mobile tariff plans
8145077 shopkeepers have to decide whether they want to save their shops or save their nameplates that dont have marathi the outcome will be there for all to see on friday
8145078 had the state government or the brihanmumbai municipal corporation been really concerned about marathi signboards they wouldnt have sat on it for all these years the bmc has collected some fines but more serious action needs to be taken
8145079 we will definitely not blacken signboards it will be more serious than that
8145080 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
8145081 according to gay gene theory genetic factors are responsible for sexual orientation with our genetic inheritance programming us to desire one sex rather than the other this is a very simple deterministic thesis a causes b i dont disagree that genes and hormonal exposure in the womb influence sexual orientation
8145082 an influence is not the same as a cause genes and hormones may predispose a person to one sexuality rather than another but thats all predisposition and determination are two different things
8145083 there is a major problem with gay gene theory and with all theories that posit the biological programming of sexual orientation
8145084 if heterosexuality and homosexuality are indeed genetically predetermined and therefore mutually exclusive and unchangeable how do we explain bisexuality or people who suddenly in mid life switch from heterosexuality to homosexuality or vice versa we cant
8145085 if gayness was primarily explainable in genetic terms we would expect it to appear in the same proportions and in similar forms in all cultures and all epochs
8145086 far from being cross culturally uniform and stable both the incidence and expressions of same sex desire vary vastly between different societies
8145087 social factors are also important influences in the formation of sexual orientation these include the relationship between a child and its parents formative childhood experiences family expectations cultural mores and peer pressure
8145088 by about the age of five or six a combination of biological and social influences seem to lay the basis of an individuals sexual orientation
8145089 they also see the gay gene explanation as a useful defense against the arguments of the religious right which dismisses same sex relationships as a lifestyle choice but no one sits down one day and chooses to be gay or straight
8145090 sexual orientation is not a choice like choosing which biscuits to buy in a supermarket we dont have free will concerning the determination of our sexual orientation our only free will is whether we accept or repress our true inner sexual and emotional desires
8145091 a terrible lack of self confidence and a rather sad desperate need to justify queer desire its almost as if those pushing these theories believe we dont deserve human rights unless we can prove that we are born gay and that our homosexuality is beyond our control we cant help being fags and dykes so please dont treat us badly this seems to be the pleading defensive sub text of much of the pro gay gene thesis surely we merit human rights because we are human beings the cause of our homosexuality is irrelevant to our quest for justice we are entitled to dignity and respect regardless of whether we are born queer or made queer and irrespective of whether our homosexuality is something beyond our control or something freely chosen
8145092 sexual orientation appears to become fixed in the first few years of life for most of us it is impossible to subsequently change our sexual orientation however what definitely can change as people grow older is their ability to accept and express formerly repressed queer desires a person who is ostensibly heterosexual might in their mid 30s become aware of a previously unrecognized same sex attraction that had been dormant and unconscious since childhood societys positive affirmation of homosexuality might help such a person discover and explore those latent hidden suppressed feelings the homophobes are thus paradoxically closer to the truth than many gay activists removing the social opprobrium and penalties from queer relationships and celebrating gay love and lust would allow more people to come to terms with presently inhibited homoerotic desires in this sense it is perfectly feasible to promote lesbian and gay sexuality and make someone queer individuals who have a homosexual component in their character but are inhibited by repression or guilt definitely can be encouraged to acknowledge their same sex attraction and act upon it
8145093 all the scientific evidence now shows that there is a very significant possibly a majority influence based on our genetic inheritance and hormonal influences in the womb
8145094 you cannot say that gay people just willfully go out and decide to be gay and choose to lead this lifestyle that is scientifically refuted it is absolutely wrong for the church to denounce condemn and ostracize gay people who do not have the freewill choice over their sexual orientation

8145098 the scheme being proposed in the green paper runs the real risk of damaging one of the best means australia has of contributing to the fight to limit and reduce global greenhouse emissions
8145099 it has been wonderful to have a commander in chief who knew from experience what it means to wear your nations military uniform what it means to spend long periods away from your family and to spend a great deal of your career moving from one new town to another what it means to go to war and to fight alongside your comrades
8145100 you and mrs jeffery know better than most what our current high operational tempo means for our young soldiers sailors airmen and women and their families the demands we place on them and the support they need
8145101 i frankly think mr mugabe might take the hint the best thing mr mugabe could do would be to walk out of the parliament and walk off the stage
8145102 he should take the hint and walk off the stage
8145103 what we have been able to glean is that the journalists the canadian the australian and the somali are unharmed they have their clothes theyre getting food regularly and they may even have access to satellite tv
8145104 you can understand that the group may be afraid of a possible armed mission to rescue the journalists
8145105 polaris is certainly moving up better and some of the midcap it stocks are doing better not just polaris even tech mahindra is giving an impression of a major accumulation happening but the big ones like satyam infosys or tcs are simply suggesting that they are in a trading range and likely to remain so
8145106 presently the stock is trading at rs 845 which is at 9 94 times to its earnings and 5 15 times to its book value of rs 185 66 since the stock seems to offer extremely good investment opportunities we initiate a buy signal on the stock with a target price of rs 1150 in medium to long term investment horizon expecting an appreciation of about 36 from the current level of rs 845
8145107 suzlon energy has been a favorite but the market doesnt respond that way it has broken down support levels the impression it gives is that its going to reach out its original support at rs 170 180 and i would not think that this is a trading opportunity or a buy on dips opportunity anymore we have to wait for that support to emerge for a stock to stay put there so it should be now out of all these
8145108 there is something going on in jp associates it is weak but there is a sense that its bottoming out in fact another infrastructure or construction stocks like punj lloyd is giving an impression of a big up move while on the other hand gmr infra is saying nothing is going to happen here so there is a mixed message coming jp associates is giving an impression that the worst is getting over at least for the short term
8145109 our goal is to get the iphone client out as quickly as possible because it does represent a significant percentage of the devices touching our network

8145112 what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
8145113 even if we are not the target we just might suffer because of the impact of a blast nearby
8145114 yes indeed we feel unsafe because of such offices in our vicinity and all the security steps that they continue to adopt goes to show that these organizations have no plans of moving out anytime soon
8145115 we have developed a method that enables us to visualise fingerprints even after the print itself has been removed we conducted a study into the way fingerprints can corrode metal surfaces
8145116 for the first time we can get prints from people who handled a cartridge before it was fired wiping it down washing it in hot soapy water makes no difference and the heat of the shot helps the process we use
8145117 the procedure works by applying an electric charge to a metal say a gun or bullet which has been coated in a fine conducting powder similar to that used in photocopiers
8145118 even if the fingerprint has been washed off it leaves a slight corrosion on the metal and this attracts the powder when the charge is applied so showing up a residual fingerprint
8145119 the technique works on everything from bullet casings to machine guns even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun
8145120 vamos a esperar la voluntad de los prefectos y si no por decreto supremo vamos a aprobar la nueva constituci n
8145121 muchas veces las normas a slan e impiden la libre decisi n esto ocurre cuando se exige 66 de los miembros hist ricos de una comunidad andina para adoptar una decisi n
8145122 las comunidades podr an asociarse con los capitales y la tecnolog a a trav s del alquiler de tierras y as aumentar el valor de millones de hect reas y de doce mil lagunas para la acuicultura
8145123 si a las tierras alquiladas llegan mejores pastos y vientres de alta productividad se convierten en un foco de progreso que irradia hacia las tierras no alquiladas
8145124 es bueno aclarar que lo esencial de la propuesta fue pensado para los andes pero por error o confusi n se
8145125 saludo su buen objetivo pero creo que hay un mejor camino por el que proteger a los m s pobres y es el desarrollo permitiendo su conexi n con el avance tecnol gico y productivo del resto del per
8145126 creo que la discusi n ha sido muy importante porque tarde o temprano se avanzar en esa direcci n no se puede dejar espacios herm ticamente cerrados al avance tecnol gico y al mercado eso mantiene el atraso y la miseria
8145127 una escalada provocada por los dos lados un mal c lculo en la apreciaci n de las intenciones de la parte adversa el miedo a perder el prestigio atizado por los ultrapatriotas llev a europa a la primera guerra
8145128 contin o porque tengo la ilusi n de trabajar por mi selecci n
8145129 if we stay disciplined defensively and capitalize on our offensive options we will have success
8145130 we have respect towards them because they are here for the same reason we are
8145131 the first game is perhaps the most important because if you win you put pressure on the other team during the second game
8145132 if we play with the right intensity we should have a good result
8145133 we are expecting them to be a little more conservative and organized in front of their own net we will have to put them under pressure and be aggressive to provoke things and finish off our scoring chances
8145134 contin o porque tengo la ilusi n de trabajar por mi selecci n
8145135 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
8145136 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
8145137 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8145138 you stupid american you think the air in beijing will pollute your lungs then why do your american team still come to the olypics you said you feel sorry about your tibetan friends then why dont give your money directly to them do you really care about them are you really friends of them you brainless american have you ever been to beijing or tibet do you have any evidence to prove what you said
8145139 it has been great being able to play with a band because there isnt a band in narooma and ive learned a lot
8145140 it is such a long and tiring drive coming up to rehearsals that ive said to my teachers on monday dont give me any work my brain is dead

8145145 amerika hat nie angst vor der zukunft gehabt und wir sollten jetzt nicht damit anfangen
8145146 to be on the lookout for stock piles and caches of supplies that could be used by violent protestors at the up coming democratic national convention
8145147 past practices of demonstrators show that they will use outlying abandoned buildings homes camping facilities secluded woods and farm fields to store their supplies
8145148 be alert for medium and large numbers of these items that seem out of place for its location this could indicate the stock piling of supplies to be used against first responders
8145149 can also be used to throw at first responders and interfere with and horses
8145150 violent protestors are using 1 1 2 inch to 2 inch self tapping screws to secure the handles on these shields
8145151 the screws have been secured to the shields to act as an assault weapon against the officers
8145152 another tactic used by violent protestors is to sharpen the upper edges of the shields and then use them as a slashing weapon against the officers
8145153 heavy wooden handles in 5 foot lengths are perfect for swinging at first responders
8145154 metal posts can also be used to hold improvised tiki torches to deliver flammable liquid on first responders
8145155 can be used in balloons to throw shoot at first responders
8145156 im confident we have everything in place to keep the event secure
8145157 first you have to know with no fear that someday you are going to die until you know that you are useless
8145158 a lot of farmers have had money tied up in dairy farmers for a long time
8145159 this gives them a chance to get some capital behind them and reinvest in the area
8145160 dairy farmers started in the illawarra so there are a lot of people in the area who dont want to see their local brand and supplier being sold to a foreign company
8145161 but in real terms once you get away from the heartstrings it is a very good thing for everyone

8145167 in three years afghanistan has gone from 82 percent of the provinces growing poppy to approximately 60 percent of the provinces being poppy free
8145168 at this point in time i would like to ask nato and isaf to concentrate on these three very physical targets targets in the hands of either insurgents or criminal groups
8145169 and therefore not attacking the farmers but attacking those who provide the opportunity for farmers to cultivate opium
8145170 we are continuing to collect information through the afghan authorities but his safety has yet to be confirmed
8145171 we will do our best so that mr ito is rescued as soon as possible
8145172 its such an international game that the opportunities to play rugby around the world are great
8145173 i cant imagine anything better over the next four to five years than maybe to end up in japan or wales or italy or france
8145174 whether i get on the field or not ive had a great ride over the last 10 seasons
8145175 theres been great support too i think im going to be more emotional about the support ive had from all the fans and from family
8145176 clinton toopi and i couldnt believe it we were hugging and jumping around grand final week was probably the best experience of my life
8145177 i havent been able to find my groove and i dont blame anyone else for me not playing well
8145178 unfortunately i had a couple of bad runs with injuries i got a few opportunities to stamp my position but i couldnt do it
8145179 with explosions continuing and a fire raging it is quite treacherous for rescuers since there are huge hidden dangers amid the blasts along with leaks of toxic gases such as ammonia and formaldehyde
8145180 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8145181 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8145182 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8145183 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8145184 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8145185 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8145186 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8145187 they bring a lot of heavy weapons and heavy logistical support from other areas in order to enter the camp to destroy the camp and to kill civilians this is the strategy of omar al bashir since he came from turkey he said that he wants to confront the international community he wants to wipe all the camps from the map in darfur
8145188 according to our people on the ground they have seen 11 bodies in unconfirmed reports the number of dead persons was higher than that number such reports will be confirmed by unamid today
8145189 we are concerned about what is going on of course and we are engaging the government of south darfur it is not the first time that these kind of events took place last year it was an almost similar scenario so we have to come out with a lasting solution and as a matter of fact the government of south darfur asked us to organize a meeting with idp representatives and representatives from international ngos to find a solution to this tension which is prevailing in this big and huge camp since a long time
8145190 we are very very very astonished by the failure of the unamid forces
8145191 they came to protect civilians and now they let civilians be killed by the khartoum government
8145192 its early to say who was behind the attack we are looking into all aspects
8145193 they the militants believe this force has become a stooge promoting someone elses agenda
8145194 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8145195 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8145196 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8145197 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8145198 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8145199 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8145200 it is prudent for the governor general to remain in canada
8145201 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8145202 wir haben uns noch nicht entschieden ob wir definitiv ein angebot abgeben werden
8145203 i would say some people thought we were going to die the woman sitting in the seat in front of us was whimpering
8145204 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible
8145205 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8145206 i was scared i think everyone was scared ive got three kids and my wife on the flight and i just sat there helplessly thinking it might be the end
8145207 i would say the crew didnt know what to do they didnt inform us for about 20 minutes which i think was wrong a little information would have calmed everyone down
8145208 my wifes oxygen bag inflated and so did my sons mine stayed flat all around me people kept tugging and saying its not working properly
8145209 the first thing we do in these situations is take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8145210 they usually inflate when passengers exhale its a trickle of pure oxygen you dont feel a rush of gas all its doing is enriching the low pressure air
8145211 the pilot is having to navigate having to communicate with air traffic control and having to avoid hitting other aeroplanes his priority is to keep the aeroplane safe
8145212 they satisfy every single safety level but it is the minimum
8145213 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 men and 15 women
8145214 this matter is of grave concern to the united nations we have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
8145215 weve been working really hard against the im just going to stay home or the the countrys not ready
8145216 they were like thats going to do it for me
8145217 we know that the racial factor is a component for some union members

8145219 the retirement sector simply because of the way they grew up they are the ones who will have to look at the issues

8145222 this is a unifying effort coming off here dont let anyone tell you otherwise and dont you go telling anyone anything different
8145223 when he said a few months ago that weve made great progress economically it made me wonder who does he mean by we and then i read he owns seven houses and it was clear that we didnt include me
8145224 our oem partner has given us an appropriate outlook regarding the annual revenue expected from the sap f amp r system that is decisive for us in addition the sales campaigns we launched will incrementally increase revenues from saf s own license sales
8145225 furthermore we have built up significant continually growing maintenance revenues in the previous years saf s services are rising following increased customer demand for analysis and implementation services
8145226 unser oem partner hat uns bez glich des zu erwartenden jahresumsatzes mit dem f r uns ma geblichen system sap f amp r einen entsprechenden ausblick gegeben zudem werden sich durch die gestartete vertriebsoffensive die erl se aus dem saf eigenen lizenzverkauf schrittweise erh hen

8145235 i am ruling out mr peters he simply doesnt have the integrity in my view unless he can somehow change that
8145236 mr glenns letter represents a direct challenge to mr peters credibility from the only person in the world in a position to know the facts
8145237 the bottom line here is that mr glenn has in writing put a very clear and direct statement mr peters has failed at this point to refute that and would have to provide clear and direct evidence that mr glenn has got it wrong you have to say what motive has mr glenn got for misleading the privileges committee
8145238 youd have to say on the balance of things yes
8145239 as far as i am concerned there comes a point where enough is enough
8145240 well thats not the point in the early part of this year mr peters held a press conference where he held up a statement and said at no time had he been involved in solicitation or receipt of 100 000 donation that according to mr glenn is factually incorrect
8145241 faced with todays revelations it is no longer acceptable for mr peters to offer bluster and insults where simple courteous honest answers are required
8145242 faced with todays revelations helen clark must stand mr peters down as a minister thats what i would do if i were the prime minister
8145243 helen clark has made it clear that she is waiting on the outcome of the privileges committee who will examine the conflicting evidence presented to it today
8145244 what was zany lollapalooza doing booking a country act wahoo
8145245 please brothers and sisters if you could just take a few steps back if you dont well have to stop and we dont want to do that we want to play everything we have for you
8145246 on my first record i didnt have a direction i just wanted to make a record
8145247 i feel pass it along is the best body of work ive done this is where i am now and where ive come from
8145248 this new series will be of the same caliber as the other two these writers know what they are doing they can write good television youve been with us this long stay with us for the ninth inning itll be worth it and thank you for the five years youve given us
8145249 i envy you you north americans are very lucky you are fighting the most important fight of all you live in the heart of the beast

8145252 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
8145253 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life

8145294 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8145295 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8145296 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8145297 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8145298 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8145299 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8145300 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8145301 the current platinum guide should be retained and clarified and a supplement added to address descriptions of platinum and non pgm alloys
8145302 a system that facilitates potentially deceptive representations is created that cannot be resolved by a complex disclose of the composition of the alloy
8145303 reasonable consumer is unlikely to comprehend information about alloy content thus the suggested disclosures are the equivalent of no disclose at all further the practical impediments required to make these disclosures means that the consumer will likely not receive the information the result will be consumers who believe that they are buying high content platinum products and they are not
8145304 simply telling a consumer that a lower purity engagement ring made not have the same attributes as a ring made of traditional platinum delivers no useful information
8145305 a consumer could easily buy a ring without understanding that it may not hold a diamond as well or might tarnish or may not be hypoallergenic
8145306 the average jewelry salesperson would be hard pressed to deliver this information at the retail level the jewelry workforce is not equipped to take on this complex metallurgical disclosure in many cases they simply will not provide the information or will provide wrong information
8145307 adopting this approach will benefit consumers by providing a clear and easily understood signal distinguishing these two very different alloys
8145308 as a result traditional platinum products are costly as platinum and other pgms are rare expensive and highly desirable
8145309 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8145310 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8145311 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

8145316 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8145317 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8145318 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8145319 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8145320 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8145321 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8145322 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8145323 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8145324 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8145325 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8145326 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8145327 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8145328 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8145329 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8145330 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8145331 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8145332 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8145333 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8145334 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8145335 who are open to doing something on the production side
8145336 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8145337 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8145338 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8145339 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8145340 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8145341 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8145342 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8145343 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8145344 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8145345 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8145346 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8145347 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8145348 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8145349 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8145350 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8145351 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8145352 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8145353 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8145354 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8145355 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8145356 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8145357 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8145358 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8145359 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8145360 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8145361 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8145362 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8145363 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8145364 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits

8145366 my colleagues in the national media are absolutely biased in the tank supporting the obama candidacy while claiming the mantle of objectivity
8145367 my party loathes me much more than your party loathes me david whats your party
8145368 i get frustrated by people who have an obvious partisan bias that dont proclaim that bias
8145369 im not uncomfortable with a guy like sean hannity or bill oreilly or keith olbermann because anybody tuning in can tell theyre not passing themselves off as objective journalists
8145370 my colleagues in the national media are absolutely biased in the tank supporting the obama candidacy while claiming the mantle of objectivity whether theyre on the front page of the washington post new york times or on any one of the newscasts
8145371 at this moment i have a lot of goodness in my life a lot my life right now is very abundant i do my best to give of myself to others and i hope for others to experience goodness as well the trouble i am having is that i look around me and see so much need and pain and suffering it pains me i mean it actually physically hurts
8145372 it hurts so much that sometimes my own pain from seeing it prevents me from being useful in any way i want to know what i can do about that
8145373 i think this pain is good i think it would be of greater concern if you saw the suffering of others and felt nothing the discomfort you feel indicates you have compassion the problem with these feelings is when you allow them to become lip service
8145374 why did the black robot have to die huh why

8145420 in the old days we believed mr or mrs right would show up someday but as we remain single for much longer and are far more mobile the chances are more remote
8145421 single men are concentrated in rural and remote communities whereas single women prefer the city and lifestyle towns
8145422 a generation ago women were more likely to remain in rural communities
8145423 there are man dams little isolated reservoirs of men in suburbs across australia where for some odd reason there are more single men than single women and you find a lot of them in rural communities

8145427 the us is bad off demographically but most of the rest of the world is worse off the us has a problem because it has not been saving but that is largely because much of the rest of the world is neo mercantilist and is subsidizing export industries and the us buys
8145428 boomers will need to labor longer and they should do so
8145429 to the extent that this causes labor shortages the us will see greater employment prospects for its people

8145433 for me giving the full time attention and focus that the show requires is not possible at the moment

8145435 this film is our tribute to the brave people of mumbai who stood up to the extreme attack of terrorism on 7 11 and emerged almost unscathed
8145436 so we decided not to rush it there was no point the film has 8 9 new young actors all straight from the streets and trained by my director joy augustine through intense workshops the film needs rigorous promotion because its got no stars but every one of those 8 9 faces is a potential star
8145437 it was a film on international terrorism and we wanted it out in the week of 7 11 when the train blasts shook mumbai but then post production took longer than we expected

8145442 when a wednesday which addresses itself to an issue thats close to mr modi as a politician was ready i wanted him to watch it i called him and requested him to do so
8145443 mr modis counter request was tell me the story in two lines i told him he immediately agreed then his staff got into action and a date was set
8145444 it the screening went off fabulously let me tell you media perceptions of mr modi are completely wrong he is misunderstood because he is outspoken he is a politician destined for very big things the good thing was he came with no prejudices and he brought his entire ministry and government machinery with him
8145445 its very important for us actors to come forward and help a film thats done with sincerity of purpose and has got a message behind it
8145446 tahaan is a kashmiri fable its got some interesting actors but the best performances come from child actor purav bhandare and then the donkey who plays his companion all others in the cast have to take a backseat to the duo

8145450 inpex has very clearly said that they wont be making a decision im sure they wont be making a decision on where they base their important project during the midst of a western australian election campaign
8145451 it was certainly supposed to be and i understand theres been some undue delay

8145479 i am old fashioned i love the sport the way it is
8145480 but the time has come for this i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay
8145481 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8145482 that any change is very very difficult in the nfl the rules change every year weve had one significant rule change in the last 35 years the dh and were still arguing over that
8145483 the ballparks have just gotten tougher and tougher over the years
8145484 youve got all of the new ballparks and fans are sitting closer to the outfield there are different colors and lines and ground rules
8145485 its going to be nice having help with instant replay
8145486 i think its a rush to judgment to implement it at this stage in the season the timing is terrible
8145487 i think that it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8145488 with the ballparks getting smaller so fans can be closer its getting harder and harder for umpires to make the right call
8145489 whenever theres a disputed call you always have one manager out there arguing
8145490 and then the umpires get together and if its overturned then the other manager comes out to report corrections and clarifications contact reader editor
8145491 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8145492 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us
8145493 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8145494 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8145495 more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church
8145496 im going to assume from her remark that she had a fundamental misunderstanding of the catholic opposition to abortion as a fundamental teaching of the church
8145497 i hope she understands this is not an historical controversy recently settled but a long standing fundamental teaching of the catholic church that abortion is inherently immoral and perhaps it will help open her heart
8145498 scandalous is the word that many catholics use when they feel that a catholic elected official of the highest rank fundamentally is erroneous about what is catholic teaching or not
8145499 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
8145500 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8145501 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
8145502 her views on when life begins were informed by the views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8145503 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view
8145504 there were some airports that were affected more than others
8145505 it appears to be an internal software processing problem were going to have to do some forensics on it
8145506 so what we had to do was dump all of the flight plan information that was in the system and then manually enter the people who were waiting to take off
8145507 thats what created the ripple effect throughout the system and created the delays that we had
8145508 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8145509 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8145510 we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english
8145511 this should be a priority in their professional development just the way working on their short game is a priority
8145512 the lpga could come out and say they only want 10 koreans but theyre not
8145513 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8145514 despite the fact that we differed on issues in every debate i pointed out my respect for him
8145515 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8145516 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8145517 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8145518 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
8145519 will consider soon a step to restore the nuclear facilities in yongbyon to their original state
8145520 will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8145521 weve been very clear with north korea that there will be action for action
8145522 and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks
8145523 i would be fairly confident the number of uninsured will go up in 2008
8145524 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8145525 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8145526 the big plus is that you can now shoot video with a great lens
8145527 the one thing thats really been missing from the slr market has been the ability to record high quality video
8145528 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
8145529 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
8145530 will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
8145531 i dont think any georgian government can accept losing those territories
8145532 absolutely in the future this is a recipe for future clashes if it is accepted by the russian government sooner or later the fighting will re erupt
8145533 recognition by russia of the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia is the necessary condition for ensuring the security of these peoples
8145534 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever be one state with georgia again
8145535 the people of south ossetia and abkhazia have made their choice in life and they have made up their minds about with whom they should be and build their economic and political relations
8145536 a very strong signal to the west that were very serious
8145537 if youre not ready to give guarantees to the abkhazians and ossetians of peace and stability in the region we will recognize them
8145538 if the west is ready to give these guarantees russia will not recognize them
8145539 only see these guarantees as real if russians take part
8145540 i think each and every member state is very clear that it is of the utmost importance to find a common position and i am going to do whatever i can so that we succeed
8145541 the russian federations actions are an attempt to militarily annex a sovereign nation the nation of georgia
8145542 this a challenge to the entire world not just georgia
8145543 the point here is the russians are bluffing and theyre overplaying their hand
8145544 i am holding talks today with international partners and will be visiting ukraine to ensure the widest possible coalition against russian aggression in georgia
8145545 the ball is in the europeans court if they want a worsening in relations they will get it of course
8145546 if they want to maintain strategic relations which is in my opinion totally in the interests of russia and europe everything will go well
8145547 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8145548 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8145549 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8145550 we plan to give a recommendation for one of the four concepts by monday

8145555 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses
8145556 a national program would be the best way to do it
8145557 most other states and some of the territories have been more successful and committed to serving children

8145602 to have that kind of exposure people talking about ucla football in anticipation of this game is terrific
8145603 we want to have people across the united states to look at this game and say that would be a cool place to play
8145604 in terms of getting our program where we want it this is important to play on this kind of stage you dont have to look very far for an example of somebody who did just that right across town usc coach pete carroll he went out and played all these kind of games and fared favorably and obviously built a program that certainly is among the best if not the best right now
8145605 odetteroulette i dont think we have heard the last of this from clinton supporters

8145607 do not go gentle into that good night blog blog against the dying of the light
8145608 thats going to be interesting because ive never been in that position before
8145609 i know one thing im going to be one proud father to have my boys out there on the field
8145610 i wanted to go to smu that was something that i put my mind to because of my uncle and my dad
8145611 i told ben the same thing my dad told me
8145612 even though i would have loved to see the legacy continue and it was in the back of my mind the value of commitment is important to us too
8145613 weve been talking about this game for months my three sisters are so excited they want to make t shirts practically my whole support system is going to be there
8145614 of course they probably wont side with one particular team they just want to see both of us do well
8145615 i dont know if they saw i saw a difference in them whereas they might have seen one in me when i talked to them about this is game week
8145616 man this is what its all about this is fun
8145617 so i didnt give them a chance to show me what they had as much as i wanted to explain what this was all about how excited they should be
8145618 he gets down there and defensive end mike bennett had already left so now he is mad because mike left
8145619 he wasnt saying much anyways so he went back inside and i was sitting out there talking to associate athletic director for football operations tim cassidy like did i do something
8145620 i wasnt sure what was going on but cassidy was like nah its just game week hes going to be like that
8145621 im doing work now but today or thursday itll start to hit me a little bit but you know its fun
8145622 you hope your coaching beats their coaching your players beat their players i will say this theyre a very well coached football team in all phases this is a good challenge for us
8145623 i tell you theyre not going to be intimidated coming into kyle field
8145624 theyve had opportunities in the past every year they play some of the top teams in the country theyve played in front of a lot of great crowds going to tennessee or going to austin and playing well so that part of it wont happen theyll be ready to play theyre very well coached
8145625 from my perspective we are going to have to play our best game
8145626 they are not going to be intimidated by who we are or this place or anything
8145627 they play big time schools every year and play them well their best games of the year seem to come against the best teams this is the first game of the year so they are healthy they are excited and they are going to have a lot of energy we know its going to be a great contest

8145631 i just needed something a little more exciting more physical
8145632 a friend introduced me to a club football i tried out and loved it
8145633 our games would have 200 250 people mostly friends and family
8145634 its pretty overwhelming when you come over here and play in front of 30 000 at robertson stadium
8145635 i struggled with the transition from german football to the college level
8145636 the rules are pretty much the same but you dont have as many athletes because its not as popular in germany the tempo and quickness arent the same the overall skills arent as high thats a big adjustment
8145637 i took english in high school so i had the basics down i got across what i was trying to say but i couldnt hold up a real conversation that first year or so the team made me feel right at home i made great friends even though i wasnt able to communicate that much they took me in and taught me and spent time with me the team became like a second family
8145638 i like to do things i like to learn things i really do like the weight room when you work hard you see the results its the same on the field when you make a mistake you see it on film and work to correct it i enjoy that part of it
8145639 he was pretty quiet when he got here because he didnt speak the language he was opened up since then he has a great sense of humor
8145640 you practice with the same guys for hours everyday and its fun when you compete with them against other people when youre playing well its 11 guys becoming one i love it
8145641 wir haben uns noch nicht entschieden ob wir definitiv ein angebot abgeben werden

8145650 ich halte die risiken der politischen szenarien in hessen f r unvertretbar
8145651 wird das sie selbst die spd in hessen und die bundes spd vor der bundestagswahl schwer besch digen
8145652 ist sie abh ngig von der linken und den traumata des herrn lafontaine sie begibt sich in die h nde einer partei die einfluss ohne verantwortung ohne jede verpflichtung h tte die w chentlich daf r sorgen kann dass regierungsf higkeit wieder verloren geht
8145653 es st rt mich dass die linke nicht in eine politische haftung genommen werden w rde darauf hat franz m ntefering schon im februar hingewiesen
8145654 nicht vorstellen mit leuten auf einer bank zu sitzen die zum teil mitverantwortlich waren diese geschichte nicht aufarbeiten und sich nicht davon distanzieren

8145752 theres an obama mania in greece and europe in general

8145756 edwards spoke to those issues when edwards pulled out i just kind of checked out and waited to see
8145757 that was really nice because it made us realize people actually care what were writing and want to hear from us
8145758 the room we were offered was 45 a night so we jokingly referred to it as the blogger crackhouse
8145759 one of our bloggers is staying at the media housing though and he said its basic economy lodging and we wouldve been fine there

8145778 the only means by which in this heterogeneous society of ours we can reach some general accommodation on what is a religiously charged and publicly charged debate
8145779 biden has opposed government funding for abortion so basically he doesnt want to put women and doctors in jail he doesnt want to criminalize abortions but nor does he want the government to pay for them
8145780 our catholic institutions will not honor catholic politicians who take pro abortion legislative positions

8145786 just what makes someone a climate researcher couldnt someone who studies solar radiation also be considered a climate researcher
8145787 its possible that the sun plays an even more central role in global warming than we have suspected anyone who claims that the debate is over and the conclusions are firm has a fundamentally unscientific approach to one of the most momentous issues of our time
8145788 there is much evidence that the suns high activity cycle is levelling off or abating if it is true that the suns activity is of great significance in determining the earths climate this reduced solar activity could work in the opposite direction to climate change caused by humans in that case
8145789 we could find the temperature levelling off or actually falling in the course of a 50 year period
8145790 atrocious weather has seriously delayed the harvest this year but this is not a symptom of so called global warming

8145794 since the focus of the ecological footprint is heuristic to awaken people particularly those in more heavily industrialized societies to their extensive resource use and its externalized costs greater precision or detail might actually get in the way of this teaching goal
8145795 land for carbon absorption is the most significant globally representing nearly half of humanitys total footprint
8145796 ecological footprints and bio capacity essential elements in sustainability assessment
8145797 half the global average eco footprint and a greater proportion in high income countries
8145798 there is a whole other point china and now india are among the most polluted countries on earth but much if not most of the worst pollution comes from particularly dirty processing and manufacturing industries that have migrated there from europe north america and japan but continue to operate producing goods mostly for consumption in those countries result the rich countries get cleaner the developing countries and their populations pay the pollution costs this phenomenon is readily revealed in our ecological footprint analyses much of the pollution in china represents the extra territorial eco footprints of the us canada europe japan australia etc not of china itself in short goklany beckerman lomborg and the like select data to create a black and white and partial caricature of a very complex and grey scale picture this is dangerously delusional and grossly misleading
8145799 philosophical prejudice that has led to unsound long term forecasts

8145808 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
8145809 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
8145810 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child

8145812 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

8145836 the obama campaign knows it cant argue the facts of the link between obama and ayers so it is instead resorting to a desperate campaign of intimidation and legal threats

8145897 if youre 13 14 15 and you have sex this is not gourmet stuff
8145898 nobodys buying you a bottle of wine and candlelight and putting some romantic music on no youre in the clothes closet or down near the dryer or dishwasher saying hurry up before my mother comes home thats why you dont know the boys name
8145899 now let me tell you the pitiful part the child youre now pregnant with neither you nor peewee are pleased with having this child if you never dreamt of having this child how are you going to think lovingly of raising it
8145900 in my time it wasnt a perfect time but it was tough trying to get some
8145901 women interviewed you what high school did you graduate from
8145902 have a coke and a smile and shut the fuck up
8145903 saya sudah datang dari jam 10 malah sebelum jam 10 saya sudah tiba jadi jangan salahkan saya karena meninggalkan acara ini karena saya masih punya agenda lain
8145904 the combined offerings are focused on helping clients accelerate growth mitigate risks and lower costs
8145905 tsg will focus on servers storage software and technology services such as installing maintaining and designing technology systems for customers as well as certain consulting and integration services
8145906 we couldnt believe the results of this research in fact we were amazed so many of us are so snoopy said virgin mobile pr manager amber morris
8145907 in a society where we very rarely let our mobile phones out of our sight its quite amazing to think that for a lot of us the minute we jump in the shower someone might be checking up on us
8145908 if i do it would be a marvelous happily received christmas present
8145909 i have heard republicans say to me i will vote for a democrat but would never send one to washington
8145910 he came to our town which is 75 percent republican and was introduced to a lot of people and he listened and engaged with them in a way he probably would not have in his first campaign
8145911 the confluence of these factors make this a different race
8145912 if we had reached across to the other side of the aisle last year we might have already begun a redeployment and have less dead potentially
8145913 its all been about ending or not ending the war by approving or limiting war funding rather than a more strategic approach in which we explained to the nation that ending the war was necessary
8145914 could be on the cusp of owning national security issues for generations
8145915 ending the war in iraq is necessary however how the war is ended is of even greater importance for united states national security the safety of members of the united states armed forces currently serving in iraq and stability in both iraq and the middle east
8145916 at times i see there is an almost physical divide between the two parties
8145917 when he speaks he has the ear of everyone on the committee
8145918 my belief is that those that have more recent experience and time in the military can help explain why certain defense polices
8145919 i know a little bit about working in the white house
8145920 and if the president doesnt listen call the first lady and with michelle obama were going to have somebody to answer that phone
8145921 because when you start running you have no idea where the path will lead
8145922 no one has been more gracious more forthcoming more helpful to me over the last few months than sen clinton
8145923 and in two days just two more days were going to make a little more history when we nominate this guy that i happen to be married to barack obama to be president of the united states
8145924 shes going to be the next eleanor roosevelt i hope
8145925 for my colleagues in the house of congress those of who work with her every day this is unbelievable to us
8145926 it just keeps occurring to us that stephanie is gone
8145927 to begin with shes a woman and she should be supporting a woman
8145928 i take the race very serious look at the gop registration edge im at a disadvantage and if you look at the very fact that john mccain is from arizona theres a lot
8145929 i think that were in a very good position were ready
8145930 i dont know if it would be good or bad
8145931 im just going to run my campaign the best i know how
8145932 given harry mitchells full throated opposition to drilling to lower the cost of gasoline and his vote to provide taxpayer funded benefits to illegal immigrants it is safe to say that he will be carrying some significant liabilities with him into the general election
8145933 in the last election the district voted for sen jon kyl r ariz and also voted for me so hopefully the district looks at people as candidates and not just by the party and thats what im really counting on
8145934 in any state in a general election the democratic congressional candidates challenge is making sure that african americans dont go into that ballot box to vote for obama and leave
8145935 youve got to be very careful for drop off votes its going to be important for these candidates to get known in the african american community
8145936 when obama was used as a foil to defeat childers our turnout among african americans was amazing compared to the first round of voting
8145937 i think the campaign feels its important to show that the uniformed military respects obama
8145938 as i watched him i saw a man of tremendous integrity it was very clear that we shared the same values
8145939 he was clearly the candidate who saw this iraq war was a loss from the start
8145940 hes got leadership qualities i wish i had barack obama is electric and that comes through in person
8145941 supports the bush policy of not talking to leaders we dont like and gave george bush the benefit of the doubt on iran and pakistan on these key questions barack obama not only made a different judgment he made the right judgment
8145942 if the key issue is the economy this fall then maybe we will stay muted
8145943 people will look at military issues and say if generals say obamas plans are ok then they must be ok
8145944 includes such suburbs as ridgewood and tenafly in bergen county and some rural communities along the pennsylvania border
8145945 is the direct result of big oil and their cronies like scott garrett blocking sound energy policy for years
8145946 she was always in a good mood always had a smile and wanted to see how you were doing
8145947 she didnt want to be on a pedestal she wanted to be like everyone else
8145948 it is hardly a secret that gov napolitano has aspirations for higher office her claims otherwise are about as valid as her discussions about controlling spending
8145949 lets hope before potomac fever sets in she cleans up our multibillion dollar budget deficit
8145950 weve got a great opportunity to take arizona for barack obama
8145951 a hometown guy might have an advantage john mccain hasnt shown himself to be interested in arizona
8145952 mccain will win arizona anyone thinking otherwise is suffering from something other than the thin denver air
8145953 sen mccain is extremely popular in arizona because arizonans know mccains track record of tackling tough issues as they say actions speak louder than words
8145954 im a delegate but i havent really done any delegate work this week
8145955 if george w bush will not sign the d c voting rights act barack obama will
8145956 we are hoping to scratch an itch to get people to hear a little more about the issue
8145957 i knew about it but probably like most of the country i havent done much about it
8145958 there has been a culture of dishonesty cronyism to a huge degree poor judgment and the expectation of self interest instead of whats best for the people of the united states
8145959 the k street types are good information gatherers but wont be the turnkey for influence
8145960 by getting the big bucks but by getting real folks money getting 5 weekly people who have never contributed before
8145961 he has pulled people in to feel a part of the process
8145962 there are plenty of d c lobbyists working for good causes
8145963 i hate to see everybody tarred with the same brush
8145964 to make a fortune and those who are trying to make a difference
8145965 i do think lobbying in d c has gotten out of hand
8145966 i think of myself as the party hostess who no one wants at their party
8145967 do i get as much access as these big time lobbyists and politicos
8145968 these are the steps to be taken to get this issue out there again and again
8145969 were not doing lunches or hosting receptions we are there but we are there as convention goers
8145970 the automakers are all broke and they have no political capital
8145971 they have nothing to play with anymore and the alternative energy groups are outdoing them
8145972 given that energy is going to be one of the no 1 issues in the election who better to be here than the industry thats responsible for providing half of the electricity america relies on every day
8145973 theres a huge opportunity because this is sort of the tipping point
8145974 we want leaders from across the country to be aware that solar energy is available now it works and with the proper policies in play it can become a much larger share of the energy mix
8145975 ryssland kan finna att det hamnat i en mycket farlig isolering om ingen annan stat st der abchaziens och sydossetiens sj lvst ndighet
8145976 h r m ste man se hur l ngt ryssland n tt de senaste ren n r det g ller att bygga upp kontakter med till exempel arabv rlden det r inte om jligt att turkiet iran syrien eller jordanien kan st dja ryssland i detta men det r os kert
8145977 m nga ryska regioner nu f r ett nytt argument f r sj lvst ndighet det m ste man se klart till exempel kan stabiliseringen i norra kaukasus se mycket annorlunda ut nu
8145978 nordkaukasus ser moskvas beslut som ett uttryck f r en beslutsamhet och styrka som det ofta har saknat de senaste ren men denna gl dje kan f ljas av en helt annorlunda reaktion
8145979 skyldighet att h lla dessa republiker flytande speciellt om ingen annan erk nner dem
8145980 v st kommer att skapa barri rer f r rysk aff rsverksamhet och kommer att komplicera visumfr gor men man kommer inte att pressa ryssland alltf r mycket av oro f r att f rlora chanserna till dialog
8145981 naturligtvis var alla negativa konsekvenser v ntade utbrott av uppr rdhet och hot fr n europa och usa och latent ovilja fr n l nder med etniska problem som kina
8145982 men ryssland har bevisat de h r dagarna att man inte vinner n got med hot och att isolering r meningsl s eftersom det inte p n got s tt r fastst llt vem som r mest beroende av den andre
8145983 where else would you expect a guy named jimmy ryan to hold a party
8145984 the day hes sworn in he says guess what i am a muslim allah akbar bitches
8145985 if he runs al qaida like he runs america hell run it into the ground
8145986 do not try to eat food with the spoons being served with the coffee
8145987 hes going to contrast the fact that john mccain voted consistently against middle class families and with george bush not only generally but very specifically
8145988 hes going to create contrasts hes been serving with john mccain he knows john mccain he can very effectively talk about why john mccain is more of the same
8145989 of the four speeches clintons has to be about our base and pulling together behind a great team bidens has to be about why this team is better than john mccains vision for america he has to show that he and obama together are a powerful recipe for change in america
8145990 i was totally unaware of the commotion when police kicked down the door of the suspect who broke a window and jumped
8145991 but in my defense i was on an upper floor
8145992 what you see before you are the handmaidens of big oil
8145993 the fact of the matter is that we are here because we see this energy issue as a national security and economic security issue for our country
8145994 at least hes supporting big oil by driving in a big truck
8145995 there is insufficient information at this time to indicate a true threat of crime or conspiracy against sen obama
8145996 they didnt reveal a plan i think what you see in the affidavit is a lot of racist ranting and a lot of hatred for sen obama as an african american to take a position at that level
8145997 johnson further related that adolf said he wanted to kill obama on the day of his inauguration and additionally stated that adolf would specifically use a 22 250 sniper rifle and high powered scope and find high ground to set up and shoot obama
8145998 there were no political reasons for wanting to kill obama and that the only reason to kill obama is because obama is black
8145999 the thing you got to remember they were all meth heads one meth head talking to another meth head on life
8146000 for years our colleagues have said to edwards why dont you run for president
8146001 he is an extraordinarily talented person he is a champion for veterans in the congress under his leadership we have passed the biggest increase in funding for veterans health benefits and other benefits in the history of our country
8146002 for a decade veterans were on a budget treadmill trying to keep up with inflation while losing with health care and other benefits
8146003 pelosi made a commitment that the va would make it a highest of priority in the congress
8146004 were doing these things because it is the right thing to do
8146005 i would say if we could get an additional 1 billion that the va would be in good shape
8146006 since democrats have taken over they have tried to convince people that although they are against the war they support the troops
8146007 republicans and democrats have been trying to out do each other on va benefits but in the end it has been good for vets
8146008 there is no way that the private sector could provide the same quality of care at the same cost
8146009 as the casualties rise people will need the care some for the rest of their lives
8146010 everyone has been playing the guessing game and the governor has been in a bunker so in the absence of any information its an interesting development
8146011 im going to wait and see how things shake out
8146012 ive made it clear that i would be honored and pleased
8146013 tammy and i are great friends but i dont know what to read into it and what it really means
8146014 its strikes me as counterintuitive to characterize the seat exclusively
8146015 its not a question of who has the greatest political connections in springfield its who can make the strongest case to gov blagojevich
8146016 im not interested in anything right now there are always people that self promote themselves and i dont get involved
8146017 i do have ideas but im not going to do that right now
8146018 it would be a distinct honor and a great privilege to serve the state of illinois in the senate
8146019 but i am not campaigning during this convention for anything other than to elect barack obama president of the united states
8146020 in my opinion they needed to stay at home and stay out on the campaign trail and keep raising money
8146021 because while obama may not win alabama hes not going to get his ideas accomplished without democratic congressional members in alabama
8146022 were trying to convince those kids that theyll make a bigger impact spending three hours making calls for these congressional candidates than they will by making calls for obama

8146026 protesters are the american way and im not just being pollyanna ish about it
8146027 ive not been invited i dont even know where they are
8146028 know how strong an advocate i am on the inside im a legislator i have a role to play
8146029 i thought theyd be saying dont piss on our parade instead they say theres a need to keep the pressure on
8146030 win without war is not protesting the democratic national convention
8146031 were frustrated that there was not more action taken quickly enough thats something weve all been frustrated with
8146032 wondering what god is up to in all of this
8146033 so much of the journey forward involves a letting go of all that once brought us life we turn away from the familiar abiding places of the heart the false selves we have lived out the strengths we have used to make a place for ourselves and all our false loves and we venture forth in our hearts to trace the steps of the one who said follow me in a way it means that we stop pretending that life is better than it is that we are happier than we are that the false selves we present to the world are really us
8146034 am i experiencing my spiritual life not as a love affair but as burdensome heavy exhausting and alien
8146035 come to me all you who are weary and burdened and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
8146036 only christ can carry us to rest the kinds of doings we have learned are not weighty enough to allow us to walk in the spiritual fields of the kingdom of god
8146037 give up everything else but him we experience the freedom of knowing that he simply loves us where we are we begin to just be having our identity anchored in him we begin to experience our spiritual life as the easy yoke and light burden jesus tells us is his experience
8146038 it is of no use to ask god to give us energy to make our way back up the cliff over which we have fallen
8146039 jesus help me all my lovers have failed me forgive me i cannot quench my thirst give me the water of life
8146040 ill send you a book that describes more about my life im sure youll get a lot out of it
8146041 id like to send you to a weekend seminar about intimacy with me and that should be very helpful

8146065 sera g n ralis d s la mi 2009 comme le souhaitait le haut commissaire aux solidarit s actives martin hirsch
8146066 la recette de cette contribution additionnelle qui sajoutera aux 11 de pr l vements sociaux existants csg crds contribution de 2 cotisation solidarit autonomie de 0 3 et qui touchera les revenus per us en 2009 serait proche de 1 4 milliards deuros

8146068 les nouvelles sources de financement devraient permettre un taux de cumul de 62 entre les revenus de la solidarit et les revenus dactivit
8146069 that is a danger to be complacent but there is so much at stake it would be criminal not to be focused
8146070 it is either being in the group stages on friday or being out
8146071 anything can happen at that level because we had a very difficult first leg but it cannot be just because you were taking this game lightly
8146072 the tie is not dead because you could see from the first leg how quickly we could score two goals from nothing
8146073 we have done the job well at twente but the job is not over
8146074 we have to respect twente and come into the game with a desire to win
8146075 it is not always easy to go into a match when you lead 2 0 but i want us to be positive and to win it
8146076 we were not good on saturday and we lost the game it is as simple as that
8146077 you cannot want the supporters not to take it to heart because we do we are all very disappointed with our performance
8146078 i shall not be bringing in anyone today or tomorrow so for now everyone should be concentrating on the job in hand and that is making sure that liverpool reach the group stages
8146079 the team have forgotten the match in liege it was just a bad day and we are thinking about qualifying at anfield
8146080 for liverpool the champions league is a huge competition and it would be a disaster not to get through
8146081 nobody in the squad is thinking about anything other than qualifying i am always optimistic and i am convinced we will beat standard
8146082 but there are no easy games in europe and we are aware that this match is not decided
8146083 i am not even considering the option of liverpool not qualifying for the group stages i am just thinking about winning
8146084 my concern now is to improve how we play we can play better liege were good in the first leg but we were really poor
8146085 if we improve and play at our real level it will be very difficult for them
8146086 liege are probably the hardest opponents we have faced in champions league qualifiers but we know we are better than them even though they played well in the first leg
8146087 at anfield we are confident we can win and i expect us to win the key is to be calm and confident in your team and the ability of your players we have the players who can win this type of game
8146088 whatever happens it will not really disrupt my transfer plans we are so close to the end of the window things will not change
8146089 but yes i am aware of the financial implications of liverpool not qualifying money is really important but that is always the situation in football
8146090 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8146091 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8146092 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalise our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8146093 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8146094 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatise social security and in 2008 he still thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8146095 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8146096 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8146097 at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right and the status quo just wont cut it
8146098 we simply cant drill our way to energy independence even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards including the ones he cant even remember
8146099 this is not the time for excuses we have been outplayed england are playing with huge motivation and huge aggression
8146100 we have got to find out what the problem is we have got a lot of experience and we have got to tap into a bit of that
8146101 we have had times on this tour when we have had to look at each other honestly and find out what mistakes we are making our rhythm and confidence is not right i dont think reading the riot act is going to help
8146102 outside of world cup semi finals this is right down there in terms of lows we did not assess conditions well enough
8146103 we have got to look at ourselves and match the england team in the way we have matched in the time that i have been involved all of us need to get together
8146104 it was not a 280 wicket and that affected how we played there was a bit of bounce but if we could have got 230 we could have put them under a pressure but when you are only chasing 80 you play with freedom
8146105 i am trying to get into him that it is really great to be on a wave but you have got to get to a level where you are cool and calm and deliver
8146106 our opportunity this week is to back up essentially and thats something that we havent been able to do for some time
8146107 when you get experiences like last week under your belt it contributes to belief if you use it in the right way if it contributes to an over confidence then it will bite you
8146108 a win would be very special not so much for the history its not something that weve spoken about thats the first ive heard of it
8146109 weve come over here with two games our focus is to win both those games so that would be very special more from the team point of view weve obviously set our goals very high and we want to achieve those
8146110 were busy enough doing that and conscious that theres another group thats looking to do the same thing and as weve seen already a week is a very long time in rugby but the great thing from your perspective in terms of interest is theres always someone suffering
8146111 nicollette sheridan and michael bolton have amicably ended their engagement
8146112 they appreciate your respect for their privacy in this matter
8146113 i thought i served well and really moved good for the first round i went on a good roll at one point there
8146114 this takes a little bit of pressure off me because i know a little more about where my game is at
8146115 i dont know much about him i only know what he looks like
8146116 i watched him play a few points on tv today i expect him to be a similar opponent who plays from the baseline
8146117 the olympic gold in doubles gave me a great lift
8146118 it really inspired me and i hope to use that to do well here
8146119 it is a special memory it was unbelievable to listen to the national anthem and share that moment with my friend
8146120 if we leave before this government resigns that means we are defeated
8146121 kate does not know the plaintiffs and has never met with them or spoken with them
8146122 im talking specifically about starters who consistently pitch six or seven innings
8146123 it just makes sense to have your best pitchers the ones youre paying the most money working those pressure innings
8146124 mentally youre training pitchers to look over their shoulder for the next guy to bail them out and then you have the 12th or 13th best pitcher on your team coming in for important outs that doesnt make sense
8146125 im not even sure i could pitch today id probably want to be a reliever as a starter you have no chance of controlling your destiny you can have a great game and not be able to finish it i trust me more than i trust a reliever
8146126 we were on a performance count not a pitch count
8146127 dont let them take you out win or lose this is great
8146128 pitchers of the generations up to marichals had a belief that this game is mine the idea of doing permanent harm to a pitchers arm didnt come into anyones mind
8146129 i think its proving over time that they arent really saving anybody guys are getting hurt just as much today as they were before if not more so this whole theory about saving their arms i aint buying it i think kids have to throw more and the more they throw the stronger theyll get in time i think it will go back to what it was for 100 years of baseball
8146130 what organization is going to have the guts to go down to the lower minors and have a four man rotation and forget about counting pitches and let them figure out how to pitch i think a lot of them want to its a combination of agents the money in the game today and fear

8146142 with rising fuel costs and increasing carbon emission both our economy and environment are at risk
8146143 we must take it on ourselves to do what we can to mitigate this risk i strongly feel that as the green sector with major responsibilities to address both our economic and environmental concerns we should show the way for others to emulate
8146144 people should feel comfortable walking or even using public transport
8146145 well get an opportunity to greet people on the way with hehe

8146159 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8146160 we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
8146161 we think it is against the territorial integrity of georgia and we cannot accept it
8146162 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe to save the lives of people for whom we are responsible because most of them they are russian citizens

8146174 i have a lifetime of experience john mccain does all barack obama has is a speech he gave in 2002

8146187 emergent christians and pomothinkers like to emphasize that the faith is a story with a storyline and want to deemphasize the rigid creedal and doctrinal aspects of the faith
8146188 the unity of the body of christ is centered on the fact that there is one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of us all and one holy spirit who is our bond of peace this means that there is really only one bride one church and one body of christ at the same time we are not gnostics and history has told a messy story of conflict within the church where brothers and sisters have divided and gone separate ways but if we know our bibles well we know that division is how god always works to bring new and glorious blessing to his people
8146189 we celebrate the protestant reformation because it is yet another sign that god has been faithful and will continue to be faithful to his people if it had been our church if it had been our planning and our scheming for the conquest of the world it would have been far more boring far more tame and whole lot less messy

8146196 browse is big and costly and has higher co2 content than our other projects
8146197 of all of our lng portfolio it is also the project that will be the most adversely affected by an unfavourable emissions trading scheme
8146198 and if we dont get that it will impact the ability of this project to move forward
8146199 if the current discussion paper is not corrected well need to consider dramatically reducing the spending that we have going in 2009 and beyond
8146200 without fundamental re working of the ets it would be hard to justify substantial expenditure on browse

8146212 im here tonight as a proud mother a proud democrat as a proud senator for new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8146213 fate of our nation and the future of our children
8146214 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team
8146215 and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8146216 she was unbelievable i thought it was really magnificent i was proud of her
8146217 which candidate offers the change we need to restore the promise of america
8146218 is it john mccain he continues to claim that under president bush we made great progress economically in 2007 he voted with the bush administration 95 percent of the time so if hes the answer the question must be ridiculous
8146219 only one candidate in the race offers the change we need to restore the promise of america a person of integrity honesty and love for his country barack obama
8146220 barack obama has a different vision and a different plan right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right and the status quo just wont cut it
8146221 now let me tell you if you think youve seen dramatic changes in the world and in technology in the last ten years you aint seen nothing yet
8146222 we cannot afford more of the same leave it to the republicans to serve a big business agenda and call it a small business plan they may not know the difference between wall street and main street but barack obama knows that small business is big business in america
8146223 i thought joe biden as a selection for barack obama was designed of course to bring foreign policy experience to barack obamas team and his ticket
8146224 i think it brings experience but if you look at joe bidens record with some 30 years in foreign policy experience theres about 30 years of being generally being wrong on foreign policy issues
8146225 unlike senator clinton i have no kind of ambiguity about my candidate
8146226 she said her candidate is unprepared to be president i announced when i was running that if i wasnt running i would support john mccain so im very enthusiastic
8146227 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8146228 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8146229 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8146292 there was some tension there it was a long battle and thats what politics is about
8146293 its a little bit like relationships you fight and you reconcile
8146294 you could argue that no one is ready to be president
8146295 sen clinton has pledged her whole support to my campaign as has president clinton
8146296 i think you will see during the course of this week that the democrat party is energized and determined to take the white house back
8146297 hell not only transform the nation hes going to transform the world
8146298 and im glad to be on the trip with him
8146299 we cant afford four more years of a foreign policy that has shredded our alliances and sacrifices our moral standing around the world
8146300 ladies and gentlemen thats the bad news but there is good news america we dont have to have four more years of george w bush and john mccain
8146301 the story of 2007 was for all intents and purposes the story of nintendo it was the story of the wii the years biggest cultural phenomenon by any metric and how it remained perpetually sold out no matter how many nintendo could muster its factories to make it was the story of competition caught flat footed how other hardware manufacturers worked to steal some small portion of nintendos new market even as third parties scrambled to get something anything out on wii it was the story of satoru iwata a man barrons listed as one of the worlds best ceos and how he led his company back to market leadership
8146302 its such a quick thing and the way the parks are thats sometimes a long way to see fan interference or fair or foul the umpires make the right call most of the time but itll be helpful
8146303 i know people want their home run to be a home run but i dont see anything wrong with the game as it is now walker said
8146304 whats next a red light goes on for a strike and a green light goes on for a
8146305 its similar to calling a guy up in september to see how he looks

8146307 it felt really good said lowry who threw fastballs as well as change ups this time
8146308 all of the follows family and close friends have been contacted weve filed a missing persons report and have reached out to the australian consulate for guidance
8146309 we should disclose that the band has been going through some hard times recently both as a band and as individuals

8146311 any equipment that has been used in freshwater has the potential to carry the alga particularly larger recreational equipment such as kayaks rafts and paddles
8146312 much more drastically needs to be done at airports and ports its not coordinated and its not seen as being serious enough
8146313 the bottom line is that once it gets in here theres no way to control it
8146314 it will run rampant particularly in tasmania because it loves cold water that runs fast
8146315 australian biosecurity officers are not doing nearly enough at points of entry
8146316 anglers are a high risk pathway but bushwalkers boots are of interest to quarantine officers for various reasons so i dont think its fair to say they are not getting reasonable attention
8146317 and my understanding is that the import requirements for didymo are being reviewed and that includes looking at different treatment options
8146318 i was in a private area in the parents room behind the curtain and this cleaner just walked in on me and watched what i was doing
8146319 she told me the parents room was for parents and breastfeeding only and that i wasnt allowed to eat lunch in there
8146320 they told me that a little kid had been running around in the parents room and had briefly seen what i was doing and had complained to its mum she said
8146321 the mum then complained to security and the cleaner came in to inspect what i was doing they told me the complaint was that there was a topless woman eating her lunch in the parents room
8146322 its tough enough that i have to do this during my break but for a complaint to be made about me doing it is really upsetting
8146323 theres a public ignorance and theres still a lack of knowledge around breastfeeding and how it works she said
8146324 this mother was very humiliated and something like this could have seen the end of her expressing milk or working
8146325 its already very stressful and then to have someone complain about it is absolutely traumatising

8146351 the current assistant secretary of the lto singled out the misuse and abuse of protocol license plates without specifying instances thereof presenting evidence in regard to the involvement of any member of the house of representatives in any incident of abuse or misuse of such license plates thereby subjecting the house of representatives and its members to public suspicion ridicule and even contempt
8146352 wala po akong binabanggit na ganon na merong mga mambabatas o mga congressmen na nagbebenta ng otsong plaka i never said anything like that that some congressmen were selling their number 8 plates
8146353 is he making liars out of the media men who quoted him in their stories i am more convinced that this blanket denial of lto chief suansing is just an excuse because he doesnt have proof to substantiate his claims it is also an obvious attempt to smokescreen the inefficiency and incompetence of the lto in carrying out its mandate

8146372 we missed chances but they also did thats how football is they were better in the first half however we were better during the second just as it had been during the first leg in the end we were simply the more effective team
8146373 slavia are one team and sparta are another altogether just as panathinaikos and ajax are we concentrate on our own team and they concentrate on their own
8146374 we had more possession and more opportunities repeatedly throughout the two matches we started nervously in the first half of both matches on both occasions there was debate in the change rooms during the break and we improved
8146375 the most important thing was for the team to qualify panathinaikos has some years left during which it will spend in the champions league and it will be a fantastic experience now that it will return to such a big competition which is the most significant club competition in the world
8146376 i am pleased with the players i have especially with the defense which has only conceded four goals in the nine matches weve played
8146377 as a sportsman i wish all athletes the best of luck so i wish both olympiakos and anorthosis the best of luck
8146378 we could celebrate today but our minds are with the young man who lost his life when he came to the stadium the win might not been anything to his family but we hope it provides something positive for them
8146379 finally i would like to thank all of the fans who came here tonight because they helped to achieve what we wanted
8146380 every player is delighted to play in such an atmosphere
8146381 we qualified with two victories which were not easy fraught with nerves and anxiety sparta took a risk in the end and it would have been a shame to have ruined everything in three minutes we are returning after three years dont forget
8146382 i have played in about 30 40 champions league matches and i am going to enjoy it were going to play more freely i hope we qualify past the group stages as we have done in the past

8146419 german authorities look into allegation that rtp research triangle park makers pesticide harms environment
8146420 f armers in the affected region had been required by the local authorities to use treated seed because of the threat posed by the western corn rootworm an insect classified as a quarantine pest
8146421 unusually high quantities of dust which had been emitted into the environment during sowing as a result of abrasion of corn seed from batches which had not been treated correctly
8146422 sampling of pollen from honeybees and from beehives was not feasible because bees could not collect appropriate pollen quantities due to the bad weather conditions hence no residue analysis of the test material and metabolites were performed on the pollen m ale and female blossoms were sampled from summer rape plants but were not analyzed since nectar analysis was considered to be sufficient to detect residues of the test material this was a deviation of the original study plan honey bee mortality in the controls was higher in the treatment exposed honey bees however there was not a significant difference based on visual inspection of the data r esults from other parameters measured i e bee foraging behavior and the weight development of the beehives are questionable due to the adverse weather conditions during the sampling period the study is classified as supplemental because this study was conducted without a prior agreed upon protocol between the registrant and the agency
8146423 this study is not scientifically sound beehives were placed in open uncaged fields and the distance between fields e g control and treatment was not provided as a result the reviewer is not convinced that bees foraged in the plots that they were intended to forage in while mortality in the 25 0 pglkg treatment group was notably higher than mortality in the control group these data were reportedly unreliable because wasps were observed removing dead bees fiom the study plots the study is not scientifically sound because measures were not taken to ensure that bees remained in intended plots and mortality data were unreliable because wasps were observed removing dead bees from the study plots the results of this study are unreliable and this study is classified as invalid
8146424 although there were no honey bees hived on the untreated control rape plot thus lessening the scientific value of this study this study is still considered to be scientifically sound but it does not fulfill the requirements for a pollinator field test because a protocol was not approved by epa for this insect field study prior to conducting the field study these studies are only required on a case by case basis a protocol was not approved by epa for this insect field study a beehive was not installed on the control plot the study authors stated that this was because the prepared beehive was not in a condition which permitted transport p 7 as a result there was no comparison to residue levels found in honeybees from the treatment plot this study was conducted without a prior agreed upon protocol between the registrant and the agency

8146457 she said that she had her there and was trying to get the other kids out as well and just somehow lost her in the panic with the other kids
8146458 she went back to get her out and could hear her inside but she just couldnt get in
8146459 it started in the lounge room on one side of the house and it just took the rest of it within two minutes
8146460 we got our hose but there was nowhere to plug it in to there was a few people out there but there was nothing we could do
8146461 there was a man trying to get back in because there was a girl lost in there
8146462 there were initially five children ranging from two up to 17 and four of them got out but unfortunately the two year old toddler did not
8146463 their grandmother made a lot of valiant efforts in getting the kids out she suffered burns and smoke inhalation trying to get the kids out
8146464 currently in the legislation it says you have to have a smoke alarm on every floor in a house what were saying is you should have smoke alarm in every bedroom

8146511 the first thing for me is the silverware i like to talk about trophies
8146512 after that comes money you have to put both things together but for me we are here to win titles
8146513 but the one thing we know is we need to win for different reasons i am not thinking about losing

8146518 cant seem to let any counter point of view alone without deleting all the vowels disemvowelling they call it isnt that so very cute and precious so the two comments i managed to make before disemvowellment
8146519 any of the stuff that you use to be a 21st century westerner

8146521 it is our religious custom not to touch our women so we cannot search females our female ips will be extremely important to use at checkpoints and government buildings throughout the province
8146522 they will bring fresh ideas to how we conduct business
8146523 but im proud to be a part of this page in kirkuks if not iraqs history
8146524 this is going to be an amazing experience for all of us
8146525 im looking forward to helping my fellow female police officer and being a part of the positive historic changes occurring here
8146526 man or women if you come through our check point we will stop you
8146527 they are not iraqis they are not muslim it is not our way
8146528 the tree grows bent in the direction of the prevailing wind and in the calm can never fully right itself
8146529 pat is one of the best developmental coaches in the game today he comes from a family of coaches and he thrives on the little things
8146530 his attention to detail and knowledge in our offensive skill developmental program was instrumental in our teams success
8146531 the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago
8146532 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
8146533 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
8146534 it always is viewed by the church as something that is wrong but theres been gradations of whether it was wrong you know from venial or mortal sin as we catholics say and versions of it
8146535 its been pretty clear thats been automatic moment of conception
8146536 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8146537 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8146538 se ores pasajeros tenemos un ligero retraso no se asusten si se siente algo debajo del tren cuando pasamos por esa v a no es nada
8146539 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8146540 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8146541 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8146542 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8146543 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8146544 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8146545 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8146546 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8146547 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8146548 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8146549 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8146550 no one works for someone we all just work together
8146551 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8146552 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8146553 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8146554 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8146555 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8146556 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8146557 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8146558 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8146559 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8146560 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8146561 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8146562 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8146563 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8146564 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8146565 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8146566 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8146567 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8146568 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8146569 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8146570 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8146571 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8146572 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8146573 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8146574 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8146575 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8146576 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8146577 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8146578 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8146579 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8146580 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8146581 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8146582 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8146583 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8146584 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8146585 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8146586 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8146587 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8146588 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8146589 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8146590 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8146591 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8146592 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8146593 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8146594 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8146595 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8146596 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8146597 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8146598 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8146599 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8146600 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8146601 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8146602 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8146603 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8146604 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8146605 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8146606 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8146607 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8146608 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8146609 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8146610 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8146611 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8146612 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8146613 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8146614 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8146615 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8146616 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8146617 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8146618 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8146619 but right now im fired up to elect barack obama
8146620 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8146621 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines its a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8146622 i think hillary would have been a good vice presidential choice but thats the past
8146623 the scripture says dont let the sun go down on your wrath
8146624 but because i believed in labor i worked as hard as if i had that title
8146625 i told him the other day i was proud of him and that hed come a long way
8146626 andre would mess up and gruden would act like its the end of the word say dramatic stuff i was always the one whod tell andre its all right
8146627 i had no room for error but at the same time i knew i could play and had the potential to be a starter and still feel like that
8146628 i had to be a role player last year still i was so nervous
8146629 hes a guy who puts a lot of pressure on himself to perform which is something youve got to have he expects to go out and play well and make big plays and hes starting to fit into his role
8146630 i think they noticed i was pretty tough and willing to do whatever i could for the team
8146631 its whatever now you need me for short yardage a seam route to go make a block chip cut ill do whatever
8146632 hes short and compact but he knows how to run
8146633 at contact he knows how to get low and hes already a low guy so its hard for guys to bring him down
8146634 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
8146635 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8146636 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8146637 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8146638 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
8146639 this is a planning took where all things are going
8146640 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8146641 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8146642 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8146643 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8146644 ted kennedy seemed to be in good spirits after a visit to the hospital
8146645 an irishmans dream is to cook for two people the pope and a kennedy one out of two aint bad
8146646 to be able to talk to bill oreilly was my way of keeping my sanity
8146647 yeah when i was on my way in here to ask you for your autograph bill oreilly walked by
8146648 well why did you pass up mr oreilly to get my autograph when you could have asked him for his
8146649 i jumped back on my bike and started chugging up the hill
8146650 the executive assistant said the guy ryan had found my wallet
8146651 i called him and he said he had a hectic schedule today and could i pick up the wallet at the hilton gardens front desk
8146652 and then i became a fashionable feminist and started shaving my armpits at 30
8146653 the overwhelming presence of law enforcement was over the top and intimidating
8146654 everybody deserves a second chance if they honestly want one
8146655 its another chapter in my life thats going to start and end well ive always been the underdog you know that taking over this team that hadnt won what does that tell you it tells me were going to win and kick some butt
8146656 i think hell make a great coach braxton knows what these kids endured just like i know what these kids endured
8146657 i feel like things have already turned around we restored order and thats the first challenge
8146658 somebody call the ball i got it i got it i got it be confident make the decision
8146659 i like the true friends i have now and i dont need the damn drugs and the partying to have fun
8146660 a lot of these kids theyre all second chance type guys
8146661 theyre getting a chance to redeem themselves and play in a program thats positive
8146662 everybody deserves a second chance if they honestly want one
8146663 i wont mention the guys but we worked hard and we played hard hard and fast baby
8146664 that was my problem i didnt think i was an addict because i would come home at night and get up and go to work the next morning i wasnt not doing my job or robbing people id get up go to work make some money and buy some dope and get high
8146665 people say oh im not hurting anybody but myself but you are youre hurting your family
8146666 ive always been the type of guy who thinks things happen for a reason ive always wanted to stop and this jump started me into stopping
8146667 he laid it out real just like coming out here and playing football
8146668 youve got somebody telling you something and youre not going to believe it unless they went through it
8146669 part of the process of getting healing is you cant keep any damn secrets thats what really eats you up the secrets
8146670 youve got to be able to tell somebody im not necessarily telling the whole expletive city of denver colorado im talking about my counselor he can know but thats a big weight off my back
8146671 i watched this community and watched this team and there was a huge need for what i have to offer
8146672 football is more fun with these guys coaching us its definitely more work but thats just what we needed
8146673 a lot of kids were going to pomona ralston valley arvada west because it was not perceived that there was any continuity or commitment at arvada there was a lot of turnover with coaches and it doesnt take much for kids to get wind of that but its been a night and day adjustment attitudewise
8146674 i always hated them damn coaches who were always on my butt and now look at me
8146675 now i find myself doing the same thing im like man am i like morton that much am i crazy i cant believe im like morton
8146676 it was like damn how am i going to have fun again i cant get high i cant drink but now i found out i can still have fun
8146677 im not running from those memories but the main reason why people slip up and relapse is they feel overconfident
8146678 so i dont ever want to feel that i dont want to feel like ive got this thing kicked so i make sure im not i just get out
8146679 im not excited im not happy i think i could have made more plays i was doing my job i just wasnt making a lot of plays out there
8146680 were going through the appeal process i have no clue as to what went on tuesday when its going to be finished
8146681 im sure it will be done in a timely fashion
8146682 sometimes it happens in a couple days sometimes it takes a couple weeks
8146683 im just working on some things working the scout team trying to stay sharp
8146684 i want to make sure its all ready because this is the week to do it
8146685 my dad he bought 40 tickets and theyre already all gone
8146686 he sold them but they are all gone and people were looking for a few more and there are a lot of others we know who are coming on their own
8146687 so im definitely excited because it is my home and the last preseason game probably the most important game ive ever played in for a lot of reasons
8146688 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
8146689 we keep saying to ourselves who is that kid and where did she come from
8146690 its all incredible and we are very proud of her
8146691 to compete at international level each one of us is required to spend at least rs 10 000 per month and if this expenditure is taken care of by way of sponsorship there will be more medals coming to india
8146692 my poor man are you planning on spending the night here on this embankment
8146693 i wont have it youre coming to my house and youre going to spend a comfortable night and youre going to get a good dinner
8146694 james please make sure hes put in the servants quarters and treated well
8146695 whats the trouble my good man didnt you get a good meal
8146696 maybe you need a little company why dont you move over a bit
8146697 theres no power crisis just unexpected malfunctions in equipment and faulty electricity lines
8146698 even if only three of our four units are working we are still able to supply the power requirements of puerto princesa and the municipalities
8146699 we cant be totally blamed for all these blackouts because theyre part of the system we cant stop them from happening even if we have our own engineers taking care of problems in our equipment they will happen because we are using machines
8146700 we have been sued by the city government on this
8146701 took the law into their hands and abetted their co officers and co employees of cjh to take the law into their hands in clear grave abuse of rights
8146702 without any court order or any notice to me they demolished the structures of the restaurant and forcibly took away all the things there
8146703 although there was notice to vacate there was no notice of demolition
8146704 was to surprise me and render me unable to seek injunctive reliefs
8146705 not only disrespected and disregarded the law and legal process but engaged in unlawful conduct and abetted activities aimed at defiance of the law and at lessing confidence in the legal system in violation of their oath as lawyers and of canon 1 rules 1 01 and 1 02 of the code of professional responsibility
8146706 these tenets underscore the role of a lawyer as the vanguard of our legal system which both alvarez and belmes defied and violated
8146707 it is unfortunate that aside from harassing our officers with criminal cases comes this
8146708 part of desperate moves of aniceto to unfairly attack counsels
8146709 losing the injunctive relief she earlier sought but was denied
8146710 it is not resolved yet because the civil case and other reliefs we sought in the civil case have not gone to trial

8146716 with intensifying hunger and poverty not just in rural but also in urban areas cordillera women are in in more difficult times searching for food resources the subsistence agricultural production which used to be sustainable and self sufficient is taken over by cash economy families have to produce cash for commodities and other needs like education and health
8146717 worse efforts from the government such as feeding and medical programs to the cordilleran children are inefficient unsustainable and only serve as showcase for the governments hunger mitigation program
8146718 lebachs employees were caught drilling in the absence of an exploration permit that was the second time they were caught why would we endorse them when theyve been violating the law
8146719 the barangays that will be directly affected can tell that they were not consulted there was a barangay that was consulted but residents do not want it why would we still approve its endorsement
8146720 its as if somebody is going to die if lebach is not endorsed why is there an emergency why their endorsement should be approved immediately

8146723 the right to life of people is inseparable from their right to sources of food and livelihood allowing the interests of big mining corporations to prevail over the peoples right to these sources amounts to violating their right to life the promised economic benefits of mining are outweighed by the dislocation of communities especially among our indigenous brothers and sisters and the risks to health and livelihood and massive environmental damage mining areas remain among the poorest areas in the country the cultural fabric of indigenous peoples is also being destroyed by the entry of mining corporations

8146734 come here to look for that information and you are exposed to everything else you get a real idea of what norwich is all about
8146735 to my mind however it was an average performance not a slashing attack on the bush cheney record nor a rousing rallying cry for obama nor a very insightful analysis of the countrys problems there was virtually nothing about foreign policy she did what she had to do tell her voters to back obama
8146736 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8146737 ill amend this if im mistaken but on first read of hillarys speech text i see no clear flat assertion that obama is qualified and prepared to be commander in chief from day one which of course was always her central critique of him that was something i had expected to see

8146754 when a wednesday which addresses itself to an issue thats close to mr modi as a politician was ready i wanted him to watch it i called him and requested him to do so
8146755 mr modis counter request was tell me the story in two lines i told him he immediately agreed then his staff got into action and a date was set
8146756 it the screening went off fabulously let me tell you media perceptions of mr modi are completely wrong he is misunderstood because he is outspoken he is a politician destined for very big things the good thing was he came with no prejudices and he brought his entire ministry and government machinery with him
8146757 its very important for us actors to come forward and help a film thats done with sincerity of purpose and has got a message behind it
8146758 tahaan is a kashmiri fable its got some interesting actors but the best performances come from child actor purav bhandare and then the donkey who plays his companion all others in the cast have to take a backseat to the duo

8146763 were going to spend every day looking for every opportunity to remind voters in the twin cities and across the country that a vote for john mccain is a vote for and his failed policies

8146765 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8146766 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8146767 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8146768 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8146769 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8146770 this is the story of america of women and men who defy the odds and never give up
8146771 knocked it out of the park she knocked it out of the state
8146772 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8146773 the frightening thing is that this data does not reflect the impact of the current economic downturn
8146774 too many families were being left behind even when the economy was relatively strong and the situation has certainly worsened since this data was collected
8146775 these figures should be a wake up call for policy makers
8146776 the effects of poverty are devastating for children and for our communities wisconsin has many strengths but we could be doing much more to help kids and families escape from the poverty trap
8146777 we know that access to quality early care and education adequately funded k 12 schools and opportunities for low income parents to qualify for good paying jobs by pursuing higher education and skills training are all critically important in moving families out of poverty
8146778 these are areas we must focus on as we make decisions about how to invest public resources in wisconsins future
8146779 we are edging closer to the ultimate goal of insuring every kid in wisconsin
8146780 if we continue to make health care coverage a priority and fill the few remaining gaps in our system of programs we can achieve that goal in the foreseeable future
8146781 the census bureau data make it clear that we need a coordinated strategic plan to end child poverty in wisconsin
8146782 the vision 2020 campaign is a way for public officials citizens and organizations to get involved in a tangible focused way poverty need not be something we just accept as inevitable we can address these issues and vision 2020 provides a roadmap for doing so
8146783 a basketball bounced on a stiff surface produces a characteristic loud thump followed by high pitched ringing

8146785 our opportunity this week is to back up essentially and thats something that we havent been able to do for some time
8146786 theyre building a bit of belief i guess when you get experiences like last week under your belt it contributes to belief if you use it in the right way if it contributes to an over confidence then it will bite you
8146787 a win would be very special not so much for the history its not something that weve spoken about thats the first ive heard of it
8146788 weve come over here with two games our focus is to win both those games so that would be very special more from the team point of view weve obviously set our goals very high and we want to achieve those

8146792 it is smaller scale pilot programs like this that provide a great learning environment where the company can try out new ideas and implement them right away

8146822 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8146823 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8146824 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8146825 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8146826 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8146827 the thing im most excited about is how much of the atmosphere of the original guk is captured in the new zones from the zone art to the effects to the population and quests guk offers both a sense of nostalgia for longtime eq players and a new haunting experience for those who have yet to enter its cursed halls
8146828 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8146829 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8146830 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8146831 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8146832 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8146833 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8146834 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8146835 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8146836 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8146837 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

8146848 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8146849 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

8146855 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8146856 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8146857 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8146858 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8146859 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8146860 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8146861 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8146862 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8146863 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8146864 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8146865 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8146866 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8146867 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8146868 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8146869 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8146870 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8146871 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8146872 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8146873 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8146874 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8146875 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8146876 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8146877 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8146878 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8146879 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8146880 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8146881 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8146882 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8146883 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8146884 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8146885 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8146886 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8146887 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8146888 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8146889 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8146890 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8146891 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8146892 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

8146928 en vue du congr s de reims mi novembre dans un entretien que publie mercredi
8146929 i get a chance to play the highest level of volleyball besides the olympics
8146930 i had a strong loyalty to sd state but i felt a stronger loyalty to my coach
8146931 they ask me a lot of questions about what he likes and what he wants
8146932 coach palileo was a huge influence on what sport i wanted to play
8146933 ce nest pas une mesure prise la l g re ou sans en avoir pleinement pes les cons quences

8146936 having seven freshmen come in its a lot different in terms of showing them the ropes and making sure they knew how everything was supposed to go
8146937 they worked really hard and all of them got noticeably better from the time they came here at the beginning of the summer until the end
8146938 its kind of a big deal especially because i was the captain of the team
8146939 its a huge honor for me to raise the trophy at the end its a great experience to be the best in europe
8146940 it was a lot of responsibility for me but i was ready to take it because i think being captain on the national team is the biggest honor you can get
8146941 i hope i can help this team washington state in some way like i helped my national team
8146942 if im gonna be captain or not that doesnt mean anything im just trying to help this team the same way i helped my national team
8146943 i felt confident in my shot just my offense and my defense are doing much better than last season
8146944 i think our role is to try and make the freshmen think like we think
8146945 we need to know and those guys need to know that we are not ucla or usc we dont get the best talent were not everyday on tv were just a small team from pullman underdogs so were trying to build that mentality
8146946 our familys struggle to remain independent was richly rewarded as triple xb xxxb was named champion premium bitter at the great british beer festival four consecutive years
8146947 we are thrilled to build on that success and return to the usa market in partnership with sbs
8146948 rarely do brands of this caliber become available and i know that lovers of classic english ales look forward to their arrival
8146949 we are very pleased to have won these awards it demonstrates the versatility of our brewery showing that we can brew two very different ales of award winning standard and get recognised for this
8146950 the passion enthusiasm and sheer quality of south west food and drink products have shone through once again we are delighted with this years winners
8146951 didnt you say at the scene of the accident im fine
8146952 well ill tell you what happened i had just loaded my favorite mule bessie into the
8146953 did you not say at the scene of the accident im fine
8146954 well i had just got bessie into the trailer and i was driving down the road
8146955 judge i am trying to establish the fact that at the scene of the accident this man told the highway patrolman on the scene that he was just fine now several weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client i believe he is a fraud please tell him to simply answer the question
8146956 id like to hear what he has to say about his favorite mule bessie
8146957 well as i was saying i had just loaded bessie my favorite mule into the trailer and was driving her down the highway when this huge semi truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my truck right in the side i was thrown into one ditch and bessie was thrown into the other
8146958 we expect the growth trend to continue for at least five more years therefore we needed to prepare for providing our customers with the products that meet their requirements both in terms of quality and quantity
8146959 having in 2006 completed an upgrade of our other quarry situated at tygerberg we are now well prepared to service our clients to their satisfaction
8146960 we are convinced that this is a good investment at the right time
8146961 the fact that the power consumption per ton produced will decrease by over 20 is an added benefit the importance of which we did not appreciate when planning the project well ahead of the power supply issues we face today
8146962 the supervision of the quality of construction and engineering should be improved
8146963 corrupt officials take all the money so the building wasnt good quality
8146964 did not have to be destroyed thats the sad truth
8146965 the earthquake in sichuan sounded the warning bell for us
8146966 in newly built and renovated schoolhouses anti earthquake precautions need to be strengthened
8146967 contractors will do what they can to save money its a fairly common phenomenon in a heated market where demand is high and there is a lack of resources
8146968 the government really has to look after the life and way of construction in the rural regions
8146969 i immediately thought about my son and knew the school was over 20 years old and maybe wasnt safe
8146970 we cant keep running at these costs the government has to give us some kind of rebate
8146971 every time the price of diesel goes up the pinch increases the quarry puts up its running costs but dont pass it on to haulers
8146972 we could be forced to give up but i couldnt imagine doing anything else
8146973 we ask for a raise but dont get one because they cant afford to run the trucks everyone is trying to save money
8146974 fuel goes up food goes up and wages stay the same
8146975 small companies are going down because of this they cant afford to pay the fuel bills
8146976 everything we buy is delivered by truck everything from food to cars
8146977 they fill up on the continent come here and dont have to fill up
8146978 there will definitely be job losses if this continues and we dont want anybody laid off
8146979 we havent had a rise for two years but the cost of living is going up
8146980 im officially retired but what i get from my pension isnt enough
8146981 we dont mind paying a little more for petrol because it is in short supply but the tax on the fuel is unfair
8146982 i didnt vote for brown i voted for blair we have rising fuel taxes and jobs are looking insecure i never asked for this fella to lead the country
8146983 completes a pattern of hyped one sided reportage that goes back a while
8146984 we are studying the viability aspect and hope to get into it in the next 18 months it has a good future in india and we plan to foray organically with our own set up
8146985 rmc has a long way to go in the country and we may foray into it in a years time
8146986 we are setting up a new rmc plant every fortnight
8146987 the rmc market will take time to mature in the country unless a company has a countrywide presence its difficult to compete let the market mature then in the next five years we will set up rmc plants
8146988 we have to study and explore possibilities how to go ahead with rmc but any such initiatives would come only after completing our new cement plant in karnataka

8146990 well keep doing it until we find the right way
8146991 i think the whole ballpark knew he wasnt going to swing but he put on a good show
8146992 its frustrating but with this team in this stadium you never know
8146993 im a competitor and i get the sense this marketplace doesnt compete
8146994 everyone is hanging on for dear life at both papers i think probably the days of high stakes competition in chicago are over to see whats happened in this business i dont want to go down with it

8147004 it was initially a temporary loan reviewed monthly by the department when our turnaround plan was agreed by the strategic health authority in february the department was happy to convert this into a long term loan with scheduled repayments over 10 years
8147005 we also have a long term loan of 1 7m dating from march 2007 this is being repaid over three years and to date we have repaid 500 000

8147018 vote for barack obama if youd be happy with massive blanket entitlements with huge tax increases on the very people who provide jobs to americans
8147019 if you want higher taxes on everyone vote for barack obama
8147020 if you want everyone to pay huge tax increases vote for obama
8147021 if they didnt want taxes to be raised they shouldnt have invaded a country and done this incredibly expensive occupation and raised this deficit
8147022 somebodys going to have to pay off this deficit and taxes are going to have to be raised thats unavoidable now its true that george bush did not raise taxes but he effectively did because he spent so much and it has to be paid for sooner or later
8147023 pretty much from the get go i didnt have my good stuff
8147024 i couldnt get ahead my curveball and changeup werent really there overall not a very good night
8147025 right when i got out there i knew something wasnt right
8147026 i was struggling to get ahead it was just brutal
8147027 but even when he doesnt have his best stuff hes got quality stuff to get you out we did a good job of waiting him out and getting balls that were up in the zone
8147028 that was a very good inning against a guy who looks like hes on his way to the cy young
8147029 with brandon you have to be patient because he sinks the ball and tries to get you to chase his off speed stuff

8147031 within the world of basketball within those trail blazers teams he was a jokester
8147032 he was a big loving teddy bear at times guys got frustrated because he didnt have a mean streak he was just a great guy he loved the team atmosphere loved being a teammate in those successful blazer teams
8147033 kevin will be remembered by fans as one of the most popular and recognizable players to ever wear the blazers uniform but to people who knew him hell be remembered as one of the warmest and biggest hearted
8147034 you wake up in the morning and its your first news of the day it just kind of hits you
8147035 for me i spent so much time with that young man and had so much success with him it really hurt its almost like losing a brother
8147036 i feel better than ever im excited ive got a whole new look on life i look at life on a whole nother radar
8147037 this may sound drastic but i have put it in gods hands and now have peace knowing that this is the best way to put this disease in check

8147044 two to three militants managed to infiltrate into the indian territory they were at a distance of 150 metres so we could not target them
8147045 there is a sensitive situation in our neighboring country i think they are taking advantage of all that and creating an atmosphere of distrust so that peace process and dialogue are delayed
8147046 when the land acquisition notice was issued at that time there was an advertisement and we requested all those land losers to register their names who are employable
8147047 the farmers did not want to lose ownership of their land so the formula we have worked out is that once the mining is over we will level the land and give it back to the farmers
8147048 we are happy and this can be an example for the rest of the country to follow our land will not be acquired and we will simply rent it out

8147056 in that situation with that team trying to make it to the playoffs that was a big one for me and for the club
8147057 im trying to make a mark for myself here but were just trying to win games
8147058 definitely im going out there trying to make a case for myself for next year
8147059 but at the same time its all about trying to win my goal is to go out there and be consistent and go deep into games
8147060 the oakland team has been struggling a lot and i knew that
8147061 but these guys have a great offense and theyre playing for the postseason so when you go out and do well against them you feel good about it
8147062 today i felt really really good theyre in the pennant race and we were able to beat them
8147063 i was throwing to delmon young the next hitter and i was still thinking about the home run
8147064 its great to be able to hand the lead over

8147071 the way the timing is happening we have the off day and jarrod washburn will be pitching on an extra days rest in cleveland
8147072 the way he pitched for us monday is a nice way to go into 2009
8147073 what do i do to stop his data going to the device
8147074 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories
8147075 if he can get himself in the right position he can definitely make plays physically he covers a lot of ground and can really get to the ball
8147076 we have observed previously that the idea of smoking a cigarette becomes increasingly attractive to smokers while they are craving
8147077 this study suggests that when smokers are not craving they fail to appreciate just how powerful their cravings will be this lack of insight while not craving may lead them to make decisions such as choosing to attend a party where there will be lots of smoking that they may come to regret

8147088 not too much has gone right for us so far this year

8147090 a lot of kids are scared of getting hurt playing football and only want to play one or two specialized sports
8147091 we need the best possible athletes in the school on the football field to keep up with burlington and limon

8147112 fernando um grande contador de hist rias conta hist rias que me atraem e eu gosto do m todo dele de trabalhar com o elenco sabia que ele improvisa muito com os atores que reinventa as cenas no set muitas das indica es que tive para construir minha personagem em cegueira vieram dele diretamente n o estavam escritas talvez sugeridas mas o olhar de fernando que vale

8147121 por outro com o aumento das temperaturas ocorrer redu o no risco de geada o que permitir que reas hoje restritas ao cultivo de plantas tropicais sejam favor veis no futuro
8147122 a din mica clim tica deve causar uma migra o das culturas adaptadas ao clima tropical para reas mais ao sul do pa s e de altitudes maiores para compensar a eleva o da temperatura
8147123 em compensa o o aumento da temperatura e da defici ncia h drica dever o expulsar definitivamente a soja do rio grande do sul estado que j considerado de alto risco para a cultura

8147137 adem s cumplimos con el plan de accesibilidad ya que hay aceras muy estrechas que no permiten rebajar las aceras para que pase una silla de ruedas y con este sistema se supera esa dificultad
8147138 vai depender de como o ministro gilmar mendes presidente do stf vai formatar o julgamento mas dificilmente a causa ser julgada na quarta feira
8147139 se decidirmos a partir de coordenadas constitucionais objetivas evidente que isso servir de par metro para todo e qualquer processo demarcat rio se n o para os passados ao menos para os futuros
8147140 se o supremo fixar que a demarca o deve ser setorizada por ilhas evidentemente se estender a todo o territ rio nacional
8147141 independentemente do resultado esse julgamento vai balizar crit rios para demarca o e a participa o dos estados nesse processo esse julgamento vai ser rico nesse tipo de orienta o
8147142 estamos dispostos a acompanhar todo o julgamento o tempo que durar o clima na comunidade de expectativa para uma solu o definitiva se a demarca o n o for cont nua para onde v o os 20 mil ind genas que l vivem

8147148 es como el cambio clim tico un problema que hemos ignorado durante mucho tiempo la situaci n de los oc anos podr a ser incluso peor porque en muchos sentidos estamos muy cerca del precipicio
8147149 han querido aplicar una ley sin haber proporcionado las medidas para evitar el problema ahora tenemos que trabajar sobre las consecuencias en una autonom a donde hay m s abandonos que adopciones

8147151 no se puede penalizar a los animales por la falta de educaci n y sensibilidad de nuestra sociedad

8147162 lo primero que me dijeron en la embajada era que la ni a que esperaba cynthia no era legalmente m a pese a ser el padre biol gico me aconsejaban salir del pa s sin ellas
8147163 el tema de los residuos en espa a est descontrolado el ministerio de medio ambiente ni siquiera centraliza la informaci n y son las grandes empresas las que se han hecho con el negocio de hacer desaparecer la basura por eso optan por incineradoras no por tratamientos espec ficos para reciclar
8147164 el problema es de partida en espa a el 90 de los residuos van a vertedero o incineradora no hay apoyo al reciclaje
8147165 y as nos va tratar la basura en origen es lo nico que solucionar a el problema los espa oles generan cada a o un 5 de residuos m s que el anterior mientras que el reciclaje lleva una d cada estancado por debajo del 10 as en 2008 nos encontramos con los vertederos colapsados normal
8147166 en europa de media el 28 de los residuos son incinerados dinamarca llega al 60 en espa a no pasamos del 7 por eso queremos construir entre 14 y 17 nuevas plantas en la pr xima d cada para llegar al menos al 20 de la basura generada
8147167 la incineraci n es sin duda la peor opci n para tratar los residuos
8147168 primero porque es la soluci n m s cara segundo porque en contra de lo que se dice no es una alternativa al vertedero el 30 de la basura que entra se convierte en cenizas t xicas que luego hay que llevar a vertederos especiales tercero porque a pesar de todos los avances tecnol gicos sigue emitiendo a la atm sfera part culas contaminantes y cuarto porque desincentiva el reciclaje las empresas incineradoras esperan de los ayuntamientos que les manden cuanta m s basura mejor porque se es su negocio
8147169 en realidad entre tirar la basura a un vertedero y quemarla en una incineradora no hay gran diferencia son soluciones finalistas una vez que nos desborda la basura lo resolvemos as buscando d nde meterla
8147170 se es el problema apostar por soluciones finalistas lo que hay que evitar es que se genere ese volumen de residuos tan alto con programas de concienciaci n ciudadana y mucha m s inversi n para la red de reciclaje poner dinero en ese trabajo previo no en construir plantas ni vertederos
8147171 pero son m s de 200 sustancias las que una planta de incineraci n emite a la atm sfera
8147172 no hay filtros para los furanos y eso no s lo contamina el aire sino toda la cadena alimentaria hay empresas de alimentaci n que en los contratos con sus suministradores de materia prima obligan a que las verduras sean de campos donde no haya una incineradora cerca la industria sabe que el problema existe
8147173 en su d a se fijaron unos l mites de emisiones lo que hay que hacer es vigilar que se cumplan esos l mites y en europa se cumplen no hay riesgos pero sobre todo no hay ninguna duda de que el vertedero es mucho m s contaminante que la incineradora el 4 de los gases de efecto invernadero proviene de la gesti n de residuos y de sos el 90 es de los vertederos
8147174 la ltima directiva de gesti n de residuos aprobada por el parlamento europeo el pasado junio aunque a n no publicada obliga a dejar el vertedero como ltima soluci n de gesti n de la basura el objetivo es que en 2020 los residuos sean o reciclados o convertidos en abono o eliminados obteniendo energ a las incineradoras resuelven eso queman la basura y generan energ a es una f rmula que la sociedad necesita m s ahora que se buscan fuentes de energ a alternativas
8147175 no debemos sobredimensionar las plantas de incineraci n por puro negocio hay que combinar esta opci n con una apuesta por el reciclaje
8147176 por primera vez europa cataloga las incineradoras como elementos de aprovechamiento energ tico no de eliminaci n de basura se olvidan de que incinerar desincentiva el reciclaje que es la aut ntica manera de ahorrar energ a
8147177 los pa ses que m s reciclan de europa alemania francia dinamarca holanda suecia son tambi n los que m s porcentaje de basura incineran y los que menos recurren al vertedero justo al rev s que espa a
8147178 lo peligroso de las incineradoras son las cenizas volantes que se generan en la combusti n las pavesas y los productos que se usan para neutralizar el cloro y el azufre
8147179 s lo representa un 4 de la basura que entra
8147180 y eso se entierra a los tres d as en vertederos especiales guardado en sacos de doble capa
8147181 las incineradoras tienen los l mites m s estrictos que hay en espa a sobre emisi n de contaminantes si te pasas de ese l mite se para la planta si le aplicasen a todas las industrias los l mites de emisi n que nos aplican a nosotros las dioxinas que se emiten proceden de 28 fuentes distintas industrias tabaco tr fico incendios y s lo el 0 001 es responsabilidad de las plantas de incineraci n

8147192 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
8147193 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
8147194 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
8147195 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive
8147196 squash is a truly global sport indeed the top six teams in last years world mens championships covered the five continents and olympic success would be the ultimate goal for all our athletes

8147206 nicht vorstellen mit leuten auf einer bank zu sitzen die zum teil mitverantwortlich waren diese geschichte nicht aufarbeiten und sich nicht davon distanzieren das geht mir gegen den strich
8147207 ich erinnere wie das in den siebziger und achtziger jahren gelaufen ist die schulden sind gestiegen der abschwung kam trotzdem
8147208 es gibt abw rtsrisiken die ich nicht untersch tze aber ich widerspreche allen die schnellz ngig eine rezession herbeireden wir sind in keiner rezession

8147216 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8147217 the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas and when hope replaces fear
8147218 there was insufficient evidence that the statements of the suspects constituted a true threat
8147219 as estimativas sobre os pre os e a renda comprovaram que essa quantidade de pobres era muito baixa
8147220 as novas estimativas representam um avan o importante na tentativa de medir a pobreza
8147221 os novos dados confirmam que o mundo provavelmente conseguir atingir a meta de reduzir pela metade o n mero de pobres entre 1990 e 2015 e a pobreza vem caindo em 1 ao ano desde 1981
8147222 a not cia ruim que a pobreza maior do que pens vamos e precisamos redobrar nossos esfor os principalmente na frica
8147223 mas diante do crescimento populacional esse progresso n o foi suficiente para reduzir o n mero de pobres fora da china
8147224 se essa tend ncia continuar um ter o dos pobres do mundo viver o na frica em 2015
8147225 dado que a pobreza t o profunda na frica um crescimento ainda maior da economia ser necess rio para ter algum impacto na pobreza

8147271 de jeito nenhum mccain n o barack obama meu candidato e ele precisa ser nosso presidente
8147272 n o importa se voc votou em mim ou em barack agora a hora de se unir como um nico partido n s estamos no mesmo time
8147273 ajudou a fazer 18 milh es de rachaduras no telhado de vidro e abrir novas possibilidades para todos os americanos
8147274 os caucuses foram roubados a campanha do obama levou um monte de gente de outros lugares para votar um absurdo
8147275 quero que hillary concorra presid ncia em 2004 n o quero que aquele homem ganhe e talvez fique por dois mandatos
8147276 john mccain meu colega e meu amigo e serviu o pa s com honra e coragem mas n s n o precisamos de mais quatro anos iguais aos ltimos oito anos mais estagna o econ mica altos pre os de gasolina mais guerra e menos diplomacia
8147277 john mccain diz que a economia est sadia john mccain n o acha que ter 47 milh es de pessoas sem assist ncia m dica uma crise john mccain quer privatizar a seguridade social com uma agenda como esta faz todo sentido que john mccain e george w bush estejam juntos nas cidade g meas na pr xima semana porque est muito dif cil de diferenci los
8147278 quando barack obama estiver na casa branca ele vai revitalizar nossa economia e eu me lembro o presidente clinton e os democratas j fizeram isso antes
8147279 seja os que votaram em mim ou em obama chegou a hora de se unir como um nico partido e com um nico objetivo
8147280 queremos um processo democr tico e justo ela hillary foi v tima de roubalheira nas prim rias e sexismo da m dia

8147285 what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
8147286 we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english
8147287 its been a hard year but the olympic doubles gold really gave me a great lift and im really inspired to do well here
8147288 i really hope i can stick around for some time
8147289 its stupid rules that somebody made in 1850 and now they give me the problems with these things and it shouldnt be that way
8147290 how can a guy see a foot fault with sunglasses from 35 feet metres away it doesnt make any sense
8147291 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8147292 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain
8147293 it makes sense they will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8147294 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8147295 revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8147296 democrats know how to do that as i recall president clinton and the democrats did it before and president obama and the democrats will do it again
8147297 began his career fighting for workers displaced by the global economy he built his campaign on a fundamental belief that change in this country must start from the ground up not the top down
8147298 a strong leader and a good man pragmatic tough and wise
8147299 the democratic party represents a much better future for everything we care about i will be making a strong case that we must stand behind our nominees
8147300 we cant afford four more years of a republican in the white house
8147301 barack and joe will stand with us and fight for us i ask all of you who worked so hard for me to work as hard for barack obama
8147302 i know a little bit about how the white house works
8147303 you know if the president is not exactly on our side call the first lady and with michelle obama were going to have someone to answer that phone
8147304 once we taxied out then they said unfortunately we cant move
8147305 we saw just this line of planes on the tarmac and we had to wait our turn until we could finally get going
8147306 once we got in the air they gave us our drinks and pretzels we needed more than that after that long time
8147307 it is time to take back the country we love and wether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8147308 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8147309 i just want to say heres the map of south ossetia and heres a town called akhalgori and ive been told that tonight russian troops are sweeping through it pushing georgians out and over the border its ethnic cleansing creating a homgenous south ossetia that is unacceptable we cant accept everything
8147310 if they want a worsening of relations they will get it but if they want to maintain strategic relations which is absolutely in the interests of russia and europe then in my view everything will be fine

8147312 the government has put this recompetition on a very tight schedule
8147313 what you see here is the improbability of conducting a major competition in record time
8147314 this delay means the pentagon is taking its time to do the right thing
8147315 its a series of small things that cumulatively add up
8147316 it took me about half an hour to create the 3d model where it would have taken me a week to do it before
8147317 it allows you to work quickly and answer tons of questions about your design in three dimensions that you wouldnt be able to answer as well by drawing it out on a board
8147318 has proven tricky especially when much of the required data lives in proprietary design systems
8147319 the level of detail may not be there if you want to design a microprocessor or the details of an engine for example
8147320 we were driving a lot to get to clients and show them designs
8147321 driving so many miles to build an environmentally sound home was counterintuitive
8147322 most of my friends dont know that facebook and myspace have japanese language sites
8147323 so i think its very unlikely that facebook and myspace can overtake mixi here
8147324 the caffeine makes drinkers think they are not impaired but they are actually supercharged drunks who think they are bulletproof
8147325 they are more likely to drive fight and have unsafe sex
8147326 the chilling part of this is that it does give people the illusion that theyre not drunk or theyre not intoxicated
8147327 physically what it does is caffeine is a stimulant and of course alcohol is a depressant
8147328 they feel more up and therefore they drink more and their blood alcohol content deceives them
8147329 theyre just getting double and triple shots of caffeine along with an herb that has another caffeine thats not listed
8147330 the reason people mix caffeine with alcohol is because they receive pleasure from it this pleasure can be very dangerous if your heart is not healthy
8147331 we feel these types of drinks are marketed to children or are appealing to adults who may not be aware the combination is really a very potent one
8147332 moderation is something that is not recognized in the u s when it comes to this type of drink
8147333 im still leaning on incumbents i think the incumbents have brought in a lot of money and im not sure about the new people
8147334 the other ones without charges against them havent been caught yet
8147335 he was a really good guy he didnt get into a lot of trouble and he didnt seem to pass judgment on some of the ones that did
8147336 hes done a great job everybodys got a few mistakes in their past but i havent seen anything that hes done that would make me want to vote for somebody else
8147337 i love him dearly but there comes a time its time for a change
8147338 begich kind of seems to be in the middle and he goes for anwr and i just typically tend to vote more that way people that kind of dont follow one way or the other
8147339 the events were decided upon by a committee of faculty members
8147340 the educate 08 program was also designed to reach out to the surrounding community and get them involved in the excitement of the debate
8147341 we have an american culture studies course focusing on the presidency
8147342 there are people who come away disturbed there are people who come away inspired i think almost to a person with one or two exceptions they understand that what christenberry is doing is important so that people do not forget what the klan was and is and so that we do not forget our past and are not doomed to repeat it
8147343 he tried to attend a klan meeting in the courthouse
8147344 william talks about going up three flights of stairs looking for the klan meeting and as hes going up the stairs to the third floor he runs into a fully robed klansman standing guard the klansman never moves he just shifts his eyes and stares at william william said that it was the most terrifying experience of his life
8147345 i think that if we had it to do over again we would have it a year earlier or a year later
8147346 i just hope that people will not come away with the wrong impression like i did at first
8147347 but every person who comes out from behind that curtain comes out with a different perspective than what they came in with it makes people think
8147348 people told me that it was interesting and they were right it was very interesting
8147349 when i finished the exhibit my heart was a little heavy i asked myself why i felt this way what purpose did it serve what was i supposed to feel my feelings went all the way from hurt to one who recognized a very talented bit of art
8147350 i was under the impression that the exhibit was pro klan right after i came out of it
8147351 but then i had people tell me it was anti klan and they pointed out a few things to me about the exhibit like the wax figures hanging down from the ceiling and the klan dolls in a miniature jail i realized that they were right
8147352 but i guess what the artist really wanted was for people to have dialogue about it and he certainly succeeded in that
8147353 the artist has in their mind what they want to communicate but it is still up to the viewer to interpret that and artists realize that
8147354 as an artist myself i dont calculate success or non success
8147355 the goal is the further artists go from an oh thats nice response to i hate that or i absolutely love that the farther away you go from that middle ground the more functionality the pieces lend to the viewer
8147356 kindle has hit a nerve and it represents the future of electronic books
8147357 over time these social networks will add great value to the experience
8147358 finally if you use an apple computer and want to sync your standard mac ical calendar with google you can get a program called spanning sync which has been working flawlessly for us during the past few weeks version 2 0 will be released any day now and will include native address book syncing
8147359 will increasingly rely on emerging markets as mature regions such as western europe japan and north america reach saturation
8147360 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8147361 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain
8147362 it makes sense they will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8147363 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8147364 revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8147365 democrats know how to do that as i recall president clinton and the democrats did it before and president obama and the democrats will do it again
8147366 began his career fighting for workers displaced by the global economy he built his campaign on a fundamental belief that change in this country must start from the ground up not the top down
8147367 a strong leader and a good man pragmatic tough and wise
8147368 the democratic party represents a much better future for everything we care about i will be making a strong case that we must stand behind our nominees
8147369 we cant afford four more years of a republican in the white house
8147370 barack and joe will stand with us and fight for us i ask all of you who worked so hard for me to work as hard for barack obama
8147371 i know a little bit about how the white house works
8147372 you know if the president is not exactly on our side call the first lady and with michelle obama were going to have someone to answer that phone
8147373 she was too good the dims are so screwed up theyve got the wrong nominee
8147374 its such an international game that the opportunities to play rugby around the world are great
8147375 i cant imagine anything better over the next four to five years than maybe to end up in japan or wales or italy or france
8147376 whether i get on the field or not ive had a great ride over the last 10 seasons
8147377 theres been great support too i think im going to be more emotional about the support ive had from all the fans and from family
8147378 clinton toopi and i couldnt believe it we were hugging and jumping around grand final week was probably the best experience of my life
8147379 i havent been able to find my groove and i dont blame anyone else for me not playing well
8147380 unfortunately i had a couple of bad runs with injuries i got a few opportunities to stamp my position but i couldnt do it
8147381 they estimated the wind at 80 to 90 mph after it broke the instrument
8147382 he was smirking while mr ruan was saying where they went
8147383 he said oh well im sure that was a complete waste of time
8147384 aber da der junge mann sehr freundlich war fragte ich ihn ob ich noch zu ende rauchen darf
8147385 das war okay f r ihn und die sache damit erledigt
8147386 auch wenn ich mit michael schumacher in einem team gefahren w re h tte ich gezeigt dass ich auch neben ihm nicht die nummer 2 bin
8147387 we dont have the means to store sort launder and then distribute clothing and other items
8147388 we provide immediate relief to the families for food for clothing and to help them start to rebuild their lives
8147389 we had almost too much help last night there was nothing we could do except love each other
8147390 this is a tragic loss for these boise families and sizzler wants to help
8147391 i wanted to bring my child home to that house
8147392 now they are gone burned up i dont think i will be going to class this week
8147393 can you believe it it is the only thing that survived the only thing left
8147394 we are to forever wonder what is in that ash
8147395 we were on our way home from my piano lessons
8147396 when we got closer we thought it was our house
8147397 we got the computer our photos and a file with important papers
8147398 were lds one of the things we teach and that we practice is to be prepared
8147399 i want the whole community to help everyone like this
8147400 i didnt think it was going to jump the street
8147401 i was making other plans when they said it was still there
8147402 when i went outside i saw a line of fire
8147403 all the neighbors went from house to house helping each other
8147404 i think there may be smoke damage i cant smell because theres so much smoke in my nostrils
8147405 the people i know who lost their homes are the best people ive ever known in my life
8147406 barack obama est mon candidat et il doit tre notre pr sident
8147407 que vous ayez vot pour moi durant les primaires ou vot pour barack le temps est venu de lunit avec un seul but nous sommes dans la m me quipe et personne dentre nous ne doit rester sur le banc de touche
8147408 quand obama sera la maison blanche il revitalisera notre conomie il d fendra les travailleurs am ricains et rel vera les d fis mondiaux de notre poque les d mocrates savent comment faire cela et je me souviens que le pr sident clinton et les d mocrates lont fait auparavant et le pr sident obama et les d mocrates le feront encore
8147409 des gens comme hillary clinton qui a fait 18 millions de fissures dans le plafond de verre pour que nos filles et nos fils puissent r ver plus grand et viser un peu plus haut
8147410 la s natrice clinton a men sa campagne des primaires en affirmant que barack obama n tait pas pr t tre commandant en chef et que jamais ce soir elle a dit quil tait pr t

8147426 a real bit of silliness that should be removed on the tripods next iteration
8147427 en este tipo de cosas no tienen que ver las diferencias
8147428 quiero que sepan las personas que se la llevaron que la tienen que si a ellos no les salieron las cosas y silvita ya estuviera con dios entonces que me digan d nde la dejaron para nosotros ir por ella y ya estar en paz no sobreviviendo
8147429 pero si silvita estuviera con vida pues entonces que me la devuelvan yo creo que ellos tienen a quien querer alguien que los quiera yo creo que ellos tienen coraz n que late

8147435 weve refined our manufacturing techniques and redesigned our low density ssds to get what the low priced pc market is looking for in the way of improved cost performance and availability
8147436 por cuando menos la mayor a de los miembros que hubieran asistido a la sesi n
8147437 el rector solamente es el conducto de la udeg en ning n lado del documento del fideicomiso aparece la facultad para que el rector pueda remover al presidente aqu lo relevante es que la ley org nica de la udeg no aplica para un fideicomiso esta ley es para asuntos internos mientras el fideicomiso tiene fondos de otras entidades como la federaci n el estado los municipios por citar ejemplos
8147438 subvierte la norma porque para esto debi sesionar el comit t cnico la decisi n de carlos brise o fue unilateral fuera de la ley
8147439 hubo una lectura incorrecta del contrato del fideicomiso de manera facciosa
8147440 el comit t cnico adoptar resoluciones fuera de sesi n siempre y cuando stas consten por escrito y el acta se encuentre debidamente suscrita por la totalidad de sus miembros
8147441 conforme al orden anterior indicado en la propia cl usula
8147442 lamentamos la destituci n de ra l una persona que siempre ha aportado mucho al corporativo tiene mucha experiencia pero seguimos trabajando mantenemos nuestra direcci n institucional
8147443 nosotros nos mantendremos al margen el cambio no est tocando la estructura de la administraci n de las empresas aunque s traer algunas consecuencias la destituci n de ra l padilla el compromiso es trabajar para que esto no se recienta
8147444 para hacer productivas a las empresas como la feria internacional del libro fil
8147445 se destituye a la gente por ineptitud o malos manejos pero no hay ninguna de las dos causas hay gentes capaces entregadas y honestas que est n trabajando y lo vemos reflejado en los n meros en los ltimos estados financieros presentados se ven claramente los ingresos extras que se est n teniendo antes era puro ponerle dinero a las empresas es gente muy valiosa partiendo de la base que es ra l padilla
8147446 jalisco se ha dado a conocer por los mejores eventos con una derrama econ mica importante de turismo en ocupaci n hotelera y de servicios esta es una decisi n tomada con el h gado

8147448 apelo a la responsabilidad de los l deres universitarios para que nuestra m xima casa de estudios mantenga por encima de todo el inter s de formar a las y a los jaliscienses y a la mejora permanente de la vida acad mica y que encuentre en el di logo la v a del crecimiento arm nico y del entendimiento entre personas capaces de anteponer el bien de la instituci n a las inevitables diferencias personales
8147449 en beneficio de los jaliscienses por lo que no tenemos que reconsiderar el tema de venderlo
8147450 primero vamos revisando la situaci n y despu s determinamos posiciones porque esto ha sido una serie de guerra de declaraciones lo primero es tener prudencia ante un escenario donde son edificios para un desarrollo de la cultura en jalisco
8147451 me extra a mucho la actitud hay que recordar que en el propio congreso el rector es el que solicit el financiamiento l personalmente ya siendo rector carlos brise o pidi presupuesto para endeudar a la udeg y culminar el centro cultural universitario
8147452 creo que el bot n que menos podemos tocar en la universidad de guadalajara es lo del mbito cultural
8147453 por la tardanza del rector general al entregar su proyecto de presupuesto ampliado a la comisi n de hacienda
8147454 pada prinsipnya memisahkan anak dari keramaian dengan maksud ingin memberi kepada anak suasana yang dalam islam disebut khusyuk maksudnya agar anak menjadi fokus serius konsentrasi menerima pelajaran tanpa hingar bingar televisi dan sebagainya
8147455 saya memakai program yang disebut sistem metafora pohon untuk jerapah kecil
8147456 kami memberi pemahaman bahwa tuhan itu satu tidak ada yang lain dan tidak boleh mengandalkan yang lain
8147457 batang pohon ini seumpama tubuh anak anak jika batang pohonnya kecil lunglai dan tidak kokoh sama seperti tubuh anak yang sakit sakitan oleh karena itu anak anak diberitahu tentang kesehatan tubuhnya ajarkan mereka untuk tak terlalu banyak makan makanan yang tak sehat sebaiknya yang bebas bahan pengawet atau pewarna kita ajak mereka untuk mau makan sayur dan buah dengan memberi alasan yang logis
8147458 hidup sehat tak cuma olah raga dan makan makanan sehat saja tetapi mereka diberi pengertian juga untuk mulai membersihkan kamar dan lingkungannya seperti menyapu mengepel dan bersih bersih
8147459 saya yakin jika anak anak sudah diajarkan melayani sesama sejak dini bangsa kita berangsur angsur akan memiliki mental yang baik
8147460 anak anak akan senang melihat wajah senang dari orang orang yang diberi kolak dan es buah inilah yang dinamakan service learning mengajari anak anak untuk berlaku ikhlas sabar dan mau mengalah demi kebaikan
8147461 jika hanya pemahaman keislaman saja yang diberikan itu terlalu sederhana sementara amal saleh atau hands on nya belum dilakukan dengan materi menyeluruh anak anak jadi tahu apa yang seharusnya ia lakukan setiap hari di dalam kehidupan sosialnya anak anak pun jadi tak malas berbuat sesuatu yang baik
8147462 masyarakat internasional tidak akan menerima pengakuan rusia atas ossetia selatan dan abkhazia hal itu sangat disesalkan untuk mendengar pengakuan secara sepihak tersebut
8147463 namun tidak realistik untuk mengatakan bahwa masalah itu akan menyebabkan bangkitnya kembali perang dingin
8147464 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights at home and around the world
8147465 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8147466 it makes a lot of sense that next week john mccain and george bush will be together in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8147467 we dont need four more years of the last eight years more economic stagnation and less affordable health care more high gas prices and less alternative energy more jobs getting shipped over seas and fewer jobs created here at home more skyrocketing debt and home foreclosures and mounting bills that are crushing middle class families more war and less diplomacy more of a government where the privileged few come first and everyone else comes last well john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 john mccain he still thinks its ok when women dont receive equal pay for equal work
8147468 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8147469 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8147470 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8147471 you will agree to being me sooner or later this side of madness or the other
8147472 you will agree to being me sooner or later this side of madness or the other
8147473 the bus pulled up all the kids got off except for mine
8147474 i felt sick i burst into tears got into my car called my husband on the way and drove over to the other side of town to the school
8147475 its not a very nice feeling when your 6 year old daughter is missing and nobody can tell you where she is
8147476 there are no missing kids we were able to locate the children on the bus and they were returned to the parents
8147477 it was two buses were trying to find out what happened right now were on the way to the school
8147478 parents are crying theyre screaming at the principal theyre screaming at the office worker theyre screaming at the cops
8147479 were reading names back and forth trying to figure out what kids they were looking for
8147480 i was thinking i was on the right bus and like i hope i get home
8147481 an additional bus which was held in reserve just in case we did have any routes that were too long is being added and lucini anticipates the problem will be resolved wednesday
8147482 while certainly this is not acceptable and we dont want to have something like this be repeated it is already being worked on an additional bus has been added and at no time was any child in any kind of danger
8147483 overall with almost 6 000 students district wide it was a very good opening day unfortunately we had this bus glitch with this one elementary school at the end of the school day
8147484 you will agree to being me sooner or later this side of madness or the other
8147485 they take the newest metal and modify and destroy it to make it look old like its junk
8147486 its almost like a sport to some of these people
8147487 they see a vacant house and say lets see what we can get out of it
8147488 john clifford 28 of 51 cynthia road was located in the side yard with a large amount of aluminum bleachers and parts
8147489 theyre also taking antenna cable from cell towers and actually steal pieces of the tower
8147490 with all these items the scrap metal is nowhere near the cost of replacing the item
8147491 i still get the first day jitters a little bit
8147492 so now if anybody asks you and you forget you have it written down
8147493 i will play any game before school as long as stays off
8147494 i always take a picture in front of the door thats part of my job description

8147522 the goal of the tracemonkey project which is still in its early stages is to take javascript performance to another level where instead of competing against other interpreters we start to compete against native code
8147523 even with this very very early version were already seeing some promising results a simple for loop is getting close to unoptimized gcc
8147524 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8147525 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for all the people in this country that feel invisible
8147526 its 3am and your children are safe and asleep who do you want answering the phone
8147527 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8147528 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
8147529 i fell in love with him because he wasnt afraid of me
8147530 for botching healthcare coming on too strong and galvanising our opponents
8147531 if i want to knock a story off the front page i just change my hairstyle
8147532 what were about is naming offenders and identifying offenders where there is a legitimate public interest to be served in doing so that is protecting the community
8147533 this is another example where mr barnett has been off doing other things for the last three years and is not aware of what the law provides already
8147534 they should not be shielded or protected by the adult court
8147535 if they want to commit adult crimes then they will be subject to the exposure and disclosure and penalties that would occur
8147536 more and more families are working harder and losing ground the poor are in terrible shape but the middle class are one paycheck away one serious illness away from being poor and deeply anxious about it together we can change that
8147537 that a well educated america will make things again because well be ready for emerging industries like clean energy life sciences and high tech that produce good jobs as well as a cleaner environment
8147538 working people will again be able to see a path into the middle class and a secure future
8147539 one generation and the circumstances of my life and family were profoundly transformed
8147540 but democrats dont deserve to win just because republicans deserve to lose
8147541 if the american story is to have a chance we need more than better programs and policies we need better vision
8147542 wanted us to understand that membership in a community is seeing the stake that each of us has in our neighbors dreams and struggles as well as our own
8147543 if we want the leadership our times demand we are going to have to work for it
8147544 talk about whacky and poorly thought out legislation this must take the cake in recent times
8147545 this is a hangover from the howard era its very very surprising that julia gillard and her fellow members of the labor cabinet have come up with a punitive option which sounds good but theres no evidence to say its going to work
8147546 in fact logically you could say that its going to make things worse because youre going to have the family of a truant child slung into even greater poverty and inability to get itself well ordered
8147547 i would have thought this government had more wit and wisdom than to come up with this howard hangover legislation
8147548 ill be looking to see if theres a clause in that bill that says if parliamentarians kids play hookey have their wages stopped until they get the child settled and back into school
8147549 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
8147550 members of the agency are clearly on heightened alert based upon the security thats involved with a convention the size of the one that is occurring in denver behavior like this can be characterized as highly suspicious i mean we considered that the vehicle he was driving was not listed or registered to him it was a rental car it was not rented in his name he has no known address where he can be contacted here the ammunition the weapons clearly that would give one great concern
8147551 i cannot talk about the federal implications associated with this case

8147581 when i talk to my family members a personal goal i set for myself is to rush for 2 000 yards
8147582 but especially working with my offensive line and seeing the holes theyre opening up against our first team defense i just feel that its something that either me or jake can accomplish or we can get 2 000 yards together
8147583 thats who he is he knows what hes capable of hes not going to shy away from it its good he has that confidence instilled in himself
8147584 i just got here as long as i get in the game thats my main focus just getting in and doing what i can do whenever i do get in
8147585 but right now jake sharp is a veteran guy who knows the system he knows what to expect jocques is new with us hes still learning hes going to play believe me hes going to get a lot of carries
8147586 we locker right next to each other so we pretty much hear about anything thats going on in the other guys daily life
8147587 i mean you spend a solid month with a guy from 6 in the morning to 10 at night you get to know him a little bit
8147588 cannot stand it thats all i hear him whining about he wants blue gatorade in the meeting room and we never get it that makes him very upset hes funny
8147589 on a mental level there are still some things i can offer jocques
8147590 he has done a really good job through camp people dont understand how hard it is to pick this offense up youre definitely going to see a lot of jocques crawford i can tell you that
8147591 when im out i see people who recognize me they say they cant wait to see me play i cant wait to see myself play
8147592 you got one guy who quit and one guy whos ineligible thats one way to separate yourself
8147593 but he has other responsibilities hes going to punt going to be the kickoff guy hes new here and we didnt want to load him down
8147594 grady is a guy who has a pit bull mentality
8147595 when he first came to camp he wasnt real sharp he could have gotten down and felt bad for himself but he didnt that just stood out to us as coaches hes going to prove that he can do this job
8147596 mom did i tell you about horse power i have to keep running because if i keep running then i will turn into a horse but if i dont keep running i will never turn into a horse
8147597 while the alleged presence of weapons in the kalma camp is a real security concern for the authorities the actions taken to address it are a clear violation of the darfur peace agreement
8147598 unamid strongly condemns the excessive disproportionate use of lethal force by the gos government of sudan security forces against civilians
8147599 i can confirm that the dead body of our colleague has been found in naw area of khewa district in a mountain and the body has been seen and confirmed by our other colleagues in the area
8147600 the police forces in the area are waiting for explosive specialists because they suspect that there might be a mine placed under his body

8147602 this is a tight race it will remain a tight race the lead will fluctuate between now and november if the spread were greater than the number of houses john mccain owns then wed be concerned
8147603 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8147604 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8147605 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8147606 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8147607 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8147608 but they are not effective against global warming and in order to ensure the long term survival of this rich marine community that is what we need to address
8147609 willing to consider offshore drilling but that is not the long term solution
8147610 i just walked over to his office and said you and i need to talk
8147611 drilling without state consent would be an absolute political disaster
8147612 were not opposed to offshore drilling everywhere there may be ways that the line can be drawn that we can live with
8147613 they should take a low profile their movements should be restricted during this period

8147615 it s probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
8147616 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8147617 the brain areas that are responsible for language in an adult do not learn how to process language during development but rather they are specialized at least in part to process language from the start

8147639 we have observed previously that the idea of smoking a cigarette becomes increasingly attractive to smokers while they are craving
8147640 this study suggests that when smokers are not craving they fail to appreciate just how powerful their cravings will be this lack of insight while not craving may lead them to make decisions such as choosing to attend a party where there will be lots of smoking that they may come to regret
8147641 to humans that sounds very short but bats operate on a completely different timescale
8147642 the time from detection of an insect to capture is often less than a second typically when they approach an insect they wait only 20 to 50 milliseconds between sounds so if they go silent for 600 or 800 milliseconds thats a long time for them
8147643 there has been a lot of speculation that they could do this but i think this is possibly the first demonstration that they are listening to other animals calls in addition to their own
8147644 when one bat went silent it was typically trailing another bat so it was in a good position to listen to the echoes and vocalizations produced by the leading bat
8147645 in the wild they could rely on spatial memory in familiar surroundings and they could also use vision in moonlight that would aid them in locating obstacles

8147649 some of them wanted to go out and smash all the cctv cameras they are still very unhappy about the cameras but they are government property and we cant move them
8147650 after this incident i realized that as soon as you step out of your door in this city you are under cctv surveillance
8147651 activists arent only followed by secret police in shenzhen anymore
8147652 they are concerned that they are followed everywhere by cctv cameras as well
8147653 they may not have face recognition technology on these cctv cameras yet
8147654 but they can easily be upgraded when the technology is available and no one will know
8147655 we already use face recognition technology in government offices and in the entrance to shopping malls in shenzhen
8147656 the technology is being upgraded day by day and the connectivity of different parts of the system to a central monitoring desk is also being constantly improved
8147657 it is a nationwide movement in china even small towns are trying to build up their own systems even though they dont have the resources that we have here
8147658 we did mobile surveillance during the olympics for the ministry of state security we have surveillance equipment inside a plain vehicle we park it at olympics venues and it sends data and pictures by satellites to the ministry
8147659 were worried that the government is using the olympics as an excuse to import this technology from western companies now the games are over we are worried they will use that technology to identify and round up dissidents
8147660 we are the national leaders in this type of technology

8147830 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8147831 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

8147858 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8147859 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8147861 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8147862 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8147904 much more drastically needs to be done at airports and ports its not coordinated and its not seen as being serious enough

8147906 it will run rampant particularly in tasmania because it loves cold water that runs fast
8147907 australian biosecurity officers are not doing nearly enough at points of entry
8147908 anglers are a high risk pathway but bushwalkers boots are of interest to quarantine officers for various reasons so i dont think its fair to say they are not getting reasonable attention
8147909 and my understanding is that the import requirements for didymo are being reviewed and that includes looking at different treatment options
8147910 but its fair to say that whatever we do there will be an inconvenience to anglers bushwalkers and others returning from new zealand
8147911 particularly in queensland and western australia were seeing many school leavers heading straight out to the mines and putting university and tertiary education on the back burner

8147913 student debt and poor workforce planning is influencing a move towards more practical learning
8147914 a lot of people want to do training that gets them to the top quickly and furthering your skills later on in your career via a degree is always an option

8147922 in the games we played and the games i saw them play he was the most impactful player on both sides of the ball in fact i feel in some of the games that bellarmine won if he wasnt on the field i think they could have lost by multiple scores that is how good i think he is he is a seriously underrated free safety he is around the ball making game saving tackles all of the time

8147926 clarks 88 years old now but in his youth he was very athletic he worked on the river driving logs and no one could handle his footing better than clark
8147927 one day a bateau was pulled up along the shore and the rope broke it drifted down the river into a section with really bad rapids so clark started running over the logs jumping onto each one chasing after it
8147928 to everyone that was watching him it looked like he was walking on water
8147929 that was the day clark walked on water thats a story that you just have to keep alive thats irreplaceable
8147930 we get a lot of different answers of course a logger in the allagash and a lobsterman in jonesboro have two totally different perspectives it all depends on where youre coming from the idea is to collect as many different stories from as many different places as possible and to have it be a kind of collective voice

8147932 id been doing a little bit of recording and archiving but now i can do even more it was really an amazing opportunity for me
8147933 one of the ways i would get them to talk to me about their health was through basketry and all the people we knew in common

8147937 things have changed so quickly here in deer isle in terms of fishing and being able to make a living in an island community
8147938 my way of honoring these citizens is to get their history to get them to speak in a way that honors them every time a story is told it changes a little bit its not about getting the entire story or getting something very factual and concrete its about getting a story that applies to them
8147939 ive always collected information i try to keep what we can and salvage all this history before its lost forever
8147940 our culture is dying its happening in the st john valley and its happening here in the allagash we cant let it be forgotten
8147941 people really do want to share their stories if you know how to draw it out of them and once you do they dont want to stop talking you can find out a lot of good history
8147942 everybody has a story if you take the time to listen to them

8147980 the bookseller diagram prize seems to be getting bigger each year
8147981 its overwhelming incredibly emotional to dig through my substantial archive of press cuttings and public correspondences regarding the prize
8147982 the public will decide although let it be known im still not entirely convinced about opening up the prize up to the public their debased vulgarity has been responsible for electing many a nudge winker a winner in recent years most notably high performance stiffened structures in 2000 and the big book of lesbian horse stories in 2003
8147983 this year 20 species seven ecological communities and two key threatening processes have been included for priority assessment they will now be thoroughly assessed to determine their national conservation status
8147984 the decision of what needs to be included in this list is based on a strategic national approach and puts a focus on the highest priority nominations
8147985 those assessed as threatened will be listed as matters of national environmental significance under the environment protection and biodiversity conservation act which will give them increased protection and the chance to be considered for conservation and recovery programs
8147986 this will help research into disease transmission and treatment and will support captive and wild populations
8147987 in addition to this its inclusion on this list means it will be assessed as a priority and if necessary its status will be upgraded increasing its protection under the epbc act
8147988 the koala is one of our greatest and most loved national icons and the government is committed to ensuring its ongoing conservation
8147989 two years ago koalas were assessed and did not at that stage meet the criteria for listing under the act however ive made a commitment to reassess the koala for listing and its conservation status will be thoroughly assessed
8147990 the review of the national strategy will provide input to the assessment of the koala the assessment will be thorough it cannot be rushed and could take up to two years
8147991 in developing this list a wide range of views from the community and expert scientific opinion are taken into consideration

8148029 when you look back historically torontos been a graveyard for young defencemen that maybe shouldnt have been integrated into the nhl lineup as early as they were
8148030 when you look at your top two lines were going to have a lot of young players there this year
8148031 how we fare during the regular season will depend very much on how half a dozen of our young players progress
8148032 were not going to be able to start finding that out until we drop the puck for real
8148033 the key word for the maple leafs management and coaching is going to be patience
8148034 you cant force things to happen you have to let them unfold and happen at their own pace

8148042 i want to get young people everywhere engaged and active and really questioning
8148043 what right do older generations have to jeopardize our future
8148044 we wanted to kick off in the most effective way possible and unite kids from all over the place
8148045 i always wanted to do something for the environment but i didnt know what to do
8148046 it was when hillary and bill came and it was like 90 to 100 degrees i just handed people water and stuff i was wearing a gore t shirt
8148047 is just helping people get set up in the morning
8148048 it was pretty cool seeing ted kennedy and michelle obama i just liked how many people had their signs up
8148049 he was put to work hed go to events and hand out literature bumper stickers a lot of publicity stuff
8148050 american people had their first date with michelle obama and it was matched in another way by another generation by ted kennedy
8148051 spanned the generations to the way people were inspired and motivated by john kennedy those of us who were their age at one time had a similar opportunity to be motivated by change
8148052 ted kennedy inspired us one more time and michelle obama is modeling that change it was an unusual historic event and ive never been prouder to be a democrat in my life

8148059 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8148060 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8148061 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8148062 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8148063 children and families living in areas already experiencing relative deprivation therefore face further inequity because they have less access to high quality childcare provision
8148064 a scheme for early release of substantial numbers of staff in the ministry of defence
8148065 the scheme ers is required because there is said to be a surplus of staff in the affected groups and the defendant is seeking to achieve substantial reduction in the numbers of civil servants in the relevant groups through this process of volunteering and being selected either for early retirement or severance
8148066 even though members of staff wish to accept such terms and are not subject to compulsory retirement
8148067 the evidential test has not been passed and it would be simply wrong to bring the prosecution
8148068 im here tonight as a proud mother a proud democrat a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8148069 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8148070 and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8148071 i havent spent the last 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal healthcare helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights here at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander our promise of a country that really fulfils the hopes of our people
8148072 homeland energy purchase of appolo fuels to add 114 million tons measured amp indicated coal to homelands global resource
8148073 the appolo mine is an excellent example of the type of asset that homeland plans to focus on for future acquisition
8148074 the growth profile for these assets both in terms of operations and in terms of sales is going to assist in the significant movement of homeland toward the mid tier of international coal companies
8148075 we have been very impressed with the production rates and operations of the appolo mine appolos operations environmental and management track records are enviable and fit well with homelands corporate mandate for safe clean efficient and profitable operations
8148076 based upon the current margins at appolo we believe that debt financing the acquisition is the most appropriate option to pursue and well within the means and capabilities of the company
8148077 we were still working over the speech text in the car over to the fleet center in 2004
8148078 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8148079 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8148080 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8148081 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8148082 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8148083 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8148084 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8148085 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8148086 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8148087 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8148088 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8148089 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8148090 barr on colbert so close to a discussion about global warming but no cigar
8148091 they are not going to disperse the crowd we are trying to negotiate
8148092 police will seek the warrants for our arrest today dont panic if we have been arrested others will carry on
8148093 if you want to arrest us come here and arrest us here it is the government who must go
8148094 the pads highly provocative action yesterday was completely uncalled for
8148095 they the pad want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8148096 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
8148097 if george w bush was seeking re election wed be 20 points ahead

8148099 we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states
8148100 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8148101 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today

8148129 the most incredible opportunity any president and vice president will have since franklin roosevelt
8148130 that all changed in 1960 when kennedy chose lyndon johnson as his running mate
8148131 will make the next president cautious about giving the vice president too much authority
8148132 one thing is clear biden does nothing to brighten obamas prospects in the electoral college
8148133 if for some reason obama is incapacitated or perish the thought dies in office people know he would be a competent president
8148134 the office of vice president has changed forever the office has explicit legal powers now maybe some will be rolled back but they cant be rolled back easily the template of being a big player in foreign affairs is established
8148135 all vice presidents since walter mondale vice president from 1977 81 have played a more important role than had historically been the case i look for biden to play a role more like al gore to clinton
8148136 hes a rudder he has a handle on the bureaucracy and knows how to get things done
8148137 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
8148138 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8148139 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8148140 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8148141 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8148142 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8148143 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8148144 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8148145 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8148146 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8148147 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8148148 actually newt gingrich is working to help prevent climate change
8148149 seems everyone that believes in gravity also hate ice cream
8148150 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8148151 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8148152 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8148153 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
8148154 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
8148155 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
8148156 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
8148157 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
8148158 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
8148159 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
8148160 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
8148161 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
8148162 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
8148163 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
8148164 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
8148165 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
8148166 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
8148167 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
8148168 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
8148169 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
8148170 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
8148171 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
8148172 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
8148173 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
8148174 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
8148175 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
8148176 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
8148177 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
8148178 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
8148179 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
8148180 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
8148181 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
8148182 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
8148183 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
8148184 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8148185 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this

8148210 to those who say 10 years is not enough time i respectfully ask them to consider what the worlds scientists are telling us about the risks we face if we dont act in 10 years
8148211 am i the only one who finds it strange that our government so often adopts a so called solution that has absolutely nothing to do with the problem it is supposed to address when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring gasoline prices down it will do nothing of the sort and everyone knows it if we keep going back to the same policies that have never ever worked in the past and have served only to produce the highest gasoline prices in history alongside the greatest oil company profits in history nobody should be surprised if we get the same result over and over again but the congress may be poised to move in that direction anyway because some of them are being stampeded by lobbyists for special interests that know how to make the system work for them instead of the american people i f you want to know the truth about gasoline prices here it is the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise and politicians cannot bring gasoline prices down in the short term
8148212 f olks who claim to know how our system works these days have told us we might as well forget about our political system doing anything bold especially if it is contrary to the wishes of special interests and ive got to admit that sure seems to be the way things have been going but ive begun to hear different voices in this country from people who are not only tired of baby steps and special interest politics but are hungry for a new different and bold approach so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years its time for us to move beyond empty rhetoric we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate im asking you each of you to join me and build this future please join the we campaign at we need you and we need you now were committed to changing not just light bulbs but laws and laws will only change with leadership

8148227 it is great that we want to do this i am not sure it is a city responsibility
8148228 this is another government program another government operation and i think probably a very high cost government operation
8148229 there can be private organizations out there that are much more efficient at handling their money than the government
8148230 there are a lot of states and counties out there that i dont want to model after

8148242 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8148243 many times there are an old restaurant or bar where a lot of deals were made and a lot of decisions were made or where the community gathered and we would like to recognize those structures as well and churches

8148276 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8148277 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8148278 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8148279 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8148280 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8148281 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8148282 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8148283 the same speech hes been giving for months why didnt he give the germans something more

8148298 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories
8148299 of the 2 519 batsmen who have taken the crease in 131 years of test cricket bradman stands alone and untouched
8148300 i am no aware of any other sport which has one competitor so far above any other performer
8148301 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days
8148302 we had to leave the house before it got worse
8148303 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
8148304 yeah we are glasses what the fuck are you going to do about it we are modernist glasses and we have things to say
8148305 after i was released i was afraid to stay alone in the dark i dont know why when i enter into a dark room i get frightened i immediately switch on the light and run away
8148306 my son was held for seven days before they released him
8148307 they locked him in a shed all by himself with rats in the darkness before he was kidnapped he was never afraid but after that he became terrified of the dark he goes to bed very late at night and he can only sleep after exhausting himself he insists on burying his head under my arm to feel safe when he sleeps
8148308 especially in children especially in the female any psychological problem is a stigma
8148309 they deny the disease but when we examine the child we discover many problems
8148310 i think the government is concern ed about the security and other issues but of course you have a big problems of our children
8148311 i didnt see any child psychiatry center outside iraq we told the ministry we told the government they say they have no money for the training
8148312 we still dont have enough time to see all the conditions admitted to this hospital
8148313 therefore we really need to open a whole ward we will open special classrooms for children with psychological disorders at schools and there will be intensive programs
8148314 thank god after those sessions there has been some improvement in his condition
8148315 with the global credit crunch and bear market entering its second year and with little end in sight we believe this is placing ongoing pressure on macquaries businesses and outlook ubs analyst jonathan mott said in a note to clients
8148316 globally we expect weaker equities volumes investment banking pipelines and softer commodities trading opportunities placing further pressure on macquaries revenues
8148317 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8148318 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
8148319 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
8148320 is there anyone else involved and how real was this plot or was it just a discussion fueled by people with delusions of grandeur and too many drugs
8148321 we will soon be holding in our hands the boxes of the game the adventure is about to begin
8148322 weve done our best to create the next great mmorp experience but its the fans that will bring our world to life
8148323 the day of reckoning approaches and its going to be glorious its time to go to war
8148324 its not about the color once they get to trust you
8148325 when they get to know him and hopefully over the next 90 days or so they will get to know him not just know of him
8148326 the conduct that he obama demonstrated during this campaign he never once mentioned cesar chavez in the speeches that i heard
8148327 its going to change a few peoples minds when they really listen to him not just hear him
8148328 everybody has the same struggles now with 4 gas retirement health care
8148329 i have faith the american people will go into those polls and vote for american issues not black issues not hispanic issues not anglo issues but american issues were americans and we need to rise to the occasion
8148330 if they were prejudicial about one they were prejudicial about the other
8148331 hillary can tell us to do whatever to support obama and unify but its not going to happen
8148332 when we leave here im afraid there will be a false sense that we have the unity to all march in line thats not going to happen
8148333 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8148334 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8148335 this is not an enviable position to be in for obama
8148336 cant live without the clintons but living with them is not a walk in the park either
8148337 these are the people in the end who will either decide that obama is fit to be the president or not
8148338 barack has said all the right things he needs to say them more often
8148339 hopefully starting tonight there will be a higher level of enthusiasm and commitment in support of sen barack obama
8148340 its time to unify and work together we have to unify the party
8148341 the clinton campaign thinks theyve done all they can and the obama campaign thinks so too
8148342 but if we dont come out of this convention running and functioning like we should then its everybodys fault
8148343 the only place these people want to be is home and they cant go home because of what has happened to them and because of the situation that the russians have caused
8148344 there is a lot to do here and my job in all of this is to make sure that the international community does not forget what is going on here
8148345 and more importantly that we make sure to continue to bring light to the difficulties and the future difficulties that may occur particularly with a hard winter coming
8148346 i would even go so far to say under the right circumstances well even transport these individuals to the proper care facility
8148347 its a question of how do we allocate those resources for the best results
8148348 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8148349 and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8148350 they know the strength of america remains the greatest force for good on this earth
8148351 the confusion here is between john mccains rhetoric that no ones love of country should be questioned and the reality of his campaigns daily false personal and detestable attacks on sen obama
8148352 but its not a surprising tactic from john mccain who is offering four more years of karl roves playbook to distract from his plan for four more years of george bushs failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8148353 but confidence in oneself and confidence in ones country are not the same
8148354 he suggested that the end of the cold war proved that there was quote
8148355 for the sake of our own security and the defense of our values in the affairs of the world american leadership is critical while we have our share of critics around the world when people in the oppressed nations of the world need support and solidarity and hope they look to america
8148356 when they talk about our country it is not with distrust or disdain but with respect and affection
8148357 they do not resent or resist americas democratic influence in the world they thank god for it
8148358 of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8148359 if i catch senator obamas drift then our failure to
8148360 and if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
8148361 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
8148362 to promote stability and peace america must stand firmly on the side of freedom and justice the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8148363 they can raise as much special interest money as they want its a bottomless pit of dirty money
8148364 its no wonder thousands of employees in the oil and gas industry as well as every other major industry overwhelmingly support senator cornyn since rick noriega thinks theyre dirty and is trying to put them out of business
8148365 so while the member of congress cant use all that money for his own campaign he can still know who the people are who write very large checks
8148366 in a body of 535 people there arent 300 leaders
8148367 its just another way to raise money a way to support higher ambitions
8148368 it is continually frustrating to see it sales people that know so much about their products but so little about the businesses of the customers they sell these products to in a 2006 frost amp sullivan report on the key issues holding back the enterprise content management market they rate
8148369 quickly get a photo of the speedo bulge while hes not looking
8148370 i am 23 now and if i went out with a girl she wouldnt see much of me until i get past 30
8148371 my main aim in life is to swim faster i am going to do even better things in london in four years time
8148372 it hasnt sunk in yet swimming in front of all those people winning all those medals i cant quite believe it
8148373 this is a tight race it will remain a tight race the lead will fluctuate between now and november if the spread were greater than the number of houses john mccain owns then wed be concerned
8148374 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8148375 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8148376 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8148377 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8148378 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8148379 but they are not effective against global warming and in order to ensure the long term survival of this rich marine community that is what we need to address
8148380 we never considered that interferon alpha could be a major player in early type 1 diabetes this was a pretty surprising finding
8148381 a normal process programmed cell death causes a normal response but it does this in such a way that in a small subset of the population it starts them on the road to type 1 diabetes
8148382 you cant be president the outrageous barriers to democracy in america
8148383 can include taking pictures or taking notes the definition is very broad
8148384 its unclear who is actually in charge and whose rules apply to the information thats being collected and shared and distributed through these fusion centers
8148385 beyond normal law enforcement functions and start becoming intelligence collectors against protest groups the reports that we obtained make clear that there was no indication of any sort of criminal activity and yet that investigation went on for 14 months and these reports were uploaded into a federal database when all these agencies are authorized to go out and start collecting this information and putting it in areas where its accessible by the intelligence community its a very dangerous proposition for our democracy
8148386 reinvest their police budget toward real community security new elementary schools health care for the uninsured providing clean renewable energy
8148387 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
8148388 you can if you wish class all science fiction together but it is
8148389 your poor son who got killed in some far gt off place for some big market interests was really somebody exceptional
8148390 you cant be president the outrageous barriers to democracy in america
8148391 plug in america co founder paul scott is blogging this week from the democratic national convention where he and a group of clean car supporters are advocating for plug in vehicles with the electric vehicle rolling showcase the blog is available at
8148392 we got to stop the train and go all right heres what we like about the show heres whats struggling in the show heres how we fix that stuff
8148393 we got two other guys that became basically cast members
8148394 i knew mike from houston doing standup freddy had come to us during the auditioning process
8148395 it is only through gradual step by step learning taking our time with it struggling with the music that you will begin to cultivate a sense of your place in the irish tradition
8148396 it occurred to me that youtube where i had been posting some solo tin whistle videos just for fun would make a great venue for hosting my videos
8148397 nevertheless youtube is also limited to posting only video and i wanted to give my students the notes to the tunes hence the blog
8148398 sometimes ill have a student who just doesnt get it
8148399 she might be on the cusp of grasping a movement and i can see it but i cant ask 34 other kids to wait for her
8148400 those who could play already and those who well needed padded helmets when it came to music
8148401 i firmly believe that my musical ministry is to pass along what i have received
8148402 to date i have received e mails expressing tremendous gratitude for my videos from vietnam brazil sweden germany korea canada ireland spain peru and many others
8148403 irish music is a living tradition something to be lived out of and it makes my heart swell with joy to know that there are people from around the world who are not only learning to love to listen to irish music but also who are learning to speak through the tradition
8148404 i have a great passion for irish music and i want to share it
8148405 it has done such wonderful things in my life and i want people to participate in that i reckon my mission is to evangelize the gospel and the whistle my spirituality is best likened to music i pray as i play with joy and awe at being invited to have a place in a much larger symphony of musicians but a symphony where my voice is both wanted and has something to add to the richness
8148406 were going to spend every day looking for every opportunity to remind voters in the twin cities and across the country that a vote for john mccain is a vote for george w bush and his failed policies
8148407 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
8148408 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
8148409 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
8148410 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
8148411 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
8148412 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
8148413 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
8148414 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
8148415 stop being mean to me on your blog you got something to say to me rubberducky83 well come up here and say it to my face right here right now you and me smackdown
8148416 if you dont hurry up and make a decision i might actually have depression
8148417 i kept thinking if only i had as much gray hair as joe biden maybe obama would have made a different decision maybe i should have gotten some of that reverse grecian formula
8148418 i hope i dont fall into the usual suspects category
8148419 oh yeah weve got to put him on there hes old faithful just like clockwork every four years
8148420 you were one of the leading spokespersons for hillary now youre one of the leading spokespersons for barack you must have something going for you
8148421 i think of myself as the party hostess who no one wants at their party
8148422 do i get as much access as these big time lobbyists and politicos
8148423 some mystical supernatural voice that was telling him where to go and look for her
8148424 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8148425 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
8148426 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
8148427 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
8148428 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
8148429 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
8148430 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
8148431 they the student pilots will be devastated as will the instructors because the instructors have a real bond with the students theyre sitting beside them for hours and hours and hours mr rushton said
8148432 the pilot in their handling of the incident avoiding the school was certainly heroic it could have been catastrophic
8148433 it was pleasing that everybody at the school was safe and no one was affected there
8148434 i was driving by and i heard a big bang and saw him go into the back of a fellows garage darren told fairfax radio network
8148435 me and another couple of guys jumped in and borrowed a fire extinguisher from the school to put it out
8148436 when responding to a scene like this of course weve got to consider the worst outcome its a residential area main through roads for the local school its opposite the residents and despite the tragic outcome of one person deceased this afternoon were certainly very pleased that no other parties were affected by this incident this afternoon
8148437 im a bit nervous now im still a bit scared
8148438 the next thing i knew there was a loud explosion and black smoke he told fairfax radio
8148439 i heard this really loud noise and all of a sudden there was a boom and a big explosion
8148440 you could see big black smoke and flames were coming out
8148441 you could see bits of plane flying off and flames shooting up
8148442 we were told a plane hit a building at cheltenham
8148443 as we understand it and were waiting for final confirmation of this two light planes possibly landing or taking off from moorabbin have clipped wings
8148444 one of those planes landed successfully and the other has crash landed into a houses garden area and as we understand it it was the pilot of the crashed plane that has been killed
8148445 there is a school right on the corner if it had come down another few hundred yards it would have been in the school
8148446 on a hot night youll be sitting in your tv room and you can hardly hear the tv they come down so low
8148447 it was nerve racking ive thought about it often what would happen if one of those planes came down its so densely populated and if youre driving down centre dandenong road they would almost touch your car during landing
8148448 i always thought somethings going to happen one day and ive lived to see it
8148449 because they are both training aircraft and both are operated by the royal victoria aero club you would assume they were both on training exercises
8148450 moorabbin airport holds a certificate from us and we audit them but we dont look at the geographic location of the airport thats a planning issue for the government
8148451 most of the big training airports in australia are in pretty similar suburban locations so its not as if moorabbin is robinson crusoe in this situation it used to be way out in the bush and the city has grown up around it
8148452 you cant be president the outrageous barriers to democracy in america
8148453 she talked to sgt marquette and told him that i didnt want to go and thats it and marquette said that i had to go and if i didnt that id have a warrant for my arrest and i wouldnt be able to get no government loans or nothing like that so my mom doesnt really know anything about it so she believed it and she told me and i believed it too because i didnt know much about it either
8148454 this is what will happen you want to go to school you will not get no loans because all college loans are federal and government loans so youll be black marked from that as soon as you get pulled over for a speeding ticket or anything with the law theyre gonna see that youre a deserter then theyre going to apprehend you take you to jail you will do your time as you deserve all that lovey dovey i want to go to college and all this guess what you just threw it out the window because you just screwed your life
8148455 well have a warrant ok so give me a call back
8148456 negative administrative action just because someone has done something wrong doesnt mean that they get the death penalty
8148457 these settlements are supposed to be the nail in the coffin of any future peace agreement with the palestinians
8148458 this place is holy to the jewish people and we have a duty to be here
8148459 the whole land of israel belongs to us and we should not be afraid to live wherever we want to the arabs must accept that
8148460 we are connected to the water grid we have phone lines from the national company bezeq we have been hooked up by the electricity company and have street lighting
8148461 we also have a kindergarten paid for by the state and a group of soldiers stationed here to protect us how can we be illegal
8148462 we can also see all the arabs from here and keep an eye on what they are doing
8148463 and in addition we can see the other settlements and check on their safety
8148464 they are very afraid that this will become simply the first of many settlements to fall
8148465 the settlers know that preparation of an alternative site could take years
8148466 the danger is that migron will be destroyed only to be resurrected in legalized form by the government as a new settlement close by adam
8148467 we believe it is possible to find a solution for the outposts that will strengthen the settlements
8148468 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
8148469 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
8148470 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
8148471 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
8148472 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
8148473 this is a democracy they call me a tyrant tyrants govern without laws were making laws and all those laws are for the benefit of the country
8148474 in bolivia i think post capitalism will be grounded in the medium or long run in two forces in the force of modern industry and in the non modern communal tradition for bolivia and perhaps peru perhaps ecuador perhaps guatemala its unimaginable to envision post capitalism without taking into account the communal strength of the indigenous communities this is what makes us different from other parts of the world
8148475 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8148476 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8148477 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8148478 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8148479 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8148480 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8148481 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8148482 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8148483 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8148484 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8148485 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8148486 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8148487 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8148488 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8148489 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
8148490 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8148491 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
8148492 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
8148493 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8148494 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8148495 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
8148496 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
8148497 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
8148498 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8148499 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8148500 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8148501 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8148502 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8148503 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8148504 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8148505 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8148506 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8148507 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8148508 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8148509 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8148510 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8148511 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8148512 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8148513 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8148514 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8148515 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8148516 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8148517 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8148518 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8148519 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8148520 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8148521 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8148522 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8148523 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8148524 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8148525 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8148526 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8148527 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8148528 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8148529 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8148530 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8148531 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8148532 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8148533 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8148534 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8148535 im a college student and not an affluent one and i simply do not have the time energy or resources to fight this battle right now
8148536 little to no legitimate legal claim and is presumably relying on my being a small developer with insufficient resources to defend myself
8148537 i dont think this will be permanent when i have the time and can find a good copyright lawyer ill be figuring out exactly what my position is and how i can make
8148538 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
8148539 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
8148540 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
8148541 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
8148542 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
8148543 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
8148544 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
8148545 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
8148546 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
8148547 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
8148548 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
8148549 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
8148550 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
8148551 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
8148552 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
8148553 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
8148554 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
8148555 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
8148556 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
8148557 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
8148558 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
8148559 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
8148560 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
8148561 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
8148562 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
8148563 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8148564 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8148565 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8148566 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8148567 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
8148568 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8148569 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8148570 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8148571 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
8148572 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
8148573 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
8148574 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
8148575 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
8148576 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
8148577 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
8148578 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
8148579 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
8148580 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
8148581 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
8148582 what was frightening to me if they were supposed to be there to protect i want to know who they were protecting
8148583 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8148584 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8148585 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8148586 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
8148587 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
8148588 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
8148589 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
8148590 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
8148591 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
8148592 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
8148593 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8148594 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8148595 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8148596 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8148597 sputtered strain gauge manufacturers sputter deposit a layer of glass onto the diaphragm sputtered strain gauge sensors actually from a molecular bond
8148598 gauge pressure is measured relative to ambient atmospheric pressure as shown in figure 3 similar to absolute pressure the abbreviations pag pascals gauge or psia pounds per square inch gauge are use to describe gauge pressure
8148599 a classic example of overloading a pressure sensor is known as the water hammer phenomenon this occurs when a fast moving fluid is suddenly stopped by the closing of a valve the fluid has momentum that is suddenly arrested which causes a minute stretching of the vessel in which the fluid is constrained this stretching generates a pressure spike that can damage a pressure sensor
8148600 gt traveling with children which is exactly what im doing right now in poland where the wheat is sharp did you know wheat is sharp i did not know this i have a bloody finger paul reddy show full
8148601 a third of canadas senators fail to show up as much as half of the time claiming business and sick days as an excuse to miss work
8148602 a lot of them are just globetrotters lets face it
8148603 a third of canadas senators fail to show up as much as half of the time claiming business and sick days as an excuse to miss work
8148604 the us is now losing the war against the taliban pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has made it a major threat to us strategic interests
8148605 without our help the whole campaign will fail it will be another vietnam
8148606 it would be madness if nato further deteriorates its relations with russia
8148607 and after the resignation of pervez musharraf we expect this situation to get much worse
8148608 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8148609 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8148610 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8148611 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8148612 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8148613 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8148614 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8148615 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8148616 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
8148617 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
8148618 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
8148619 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
8148620 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
8148621 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8148622 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8148623 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
8148624 our landline billing system as of now works on the conventional technology and we are unable to give a customised offer to subscribers but very soon all that will be a thing of the past
8148625 one of the advantages of the new billing system is that one single bill could be generated for an entire corporate house and the payments also accordingly be made from any where in the country

8148627 we are looking at all opportunities that would add value to the company
8148628 the costs were going up and there was a delay in the delivery of the two rigs
8148629 in the final analysis many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy they are thus part of the market failure that is climate change
8148630 gustav is moving back over water and is expected to regain hurricane strength on wednesday once it clears the south western peninsula of haiti
8148631 more significant strengthening is forecast on thursday and gustav could become a category two hurricane when it passes between cuba and jamaica
8148632 if gustav is able to thread the needle passing through the yucatan channel into the gulf of mexico it could intensify to category four or five strength over the warm water in the gulf

8148635 i can confirm that the dead body of our colleague has been found in naw area of khewa district in a mountain and the body has been seen and confirmed by our other colleagues in the area

8148643 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8148644 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8148645 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8148646 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8148647 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8148648 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8148649 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8148650 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8148651 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8148652 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8148653 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8148654 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8148655 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8148656 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8148657 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8148658 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8148659 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8148660 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8148661 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8148662 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalise our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8148663 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8148664 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatise social security and in 2008 he still thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8148665 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8148666 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8148667 at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right and the status quo just wont cut it
8148668 we simply cant drill our way to energy independence even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards including the ones he cant even remember
8148669 its a patriotic poem i wrote to cheer up my country during the olympic games
8148670 any equipment that has been used in freshwater has the potential to carry the alga particularly larger recreational equipment such as kayaks rafts and paddles
8148671 much more drastically needs to be done at airports and ports its not coordinated and its not seen as being serious enough
8148672 the bottom line is that once it gets in here theres no way to control it
8148673 it will run rampant particularly in tasmania because it loves cold water that runs fast
8148674 australian biosecurity officers are not doing nearly enough at points of entry
8148675 anglers are a high risk pathway but bushwalkers boots are of interest to quarantine officers for various reasons so i dont think its fair to say they are not getting reasonable attention
8148676 and my understanding is that the import requirements for didymo are being reviewed and that includes looking at different treatment options
8148677 but its fair to say that whatever we do there will be an inconvenience to anglers bushwalkers and others returning from new zealand
8148678 i was in a private area in the parents room behind the curtain and this cleaner just walked in on me and watched what i was doing
8148679 she told me the parents room was for parents and breastfeeding only and that i wasnt allowed to eat lunch in there
8148680 they told me that a little kid had been running around in the parents room and had briefly seen what i was doing and had complained to its mum she said
8148681 the mum then complained to security and the cleaner came in to inspect what i was doing they told me the complaint was that there was a topless woman eating her lunch in the parents room
8148682 its tough enough that i have to do this during my break but for a complaint to be made about me doing it is really upsetting
8148683 theres a public ignorance and theres still a lack of knowledge around breastfeeding and how it works she said
8148684 this mother was very humiliated and something like this could have seen the end of her expressing milk or working
8148685 its already very stressful and then to have someone complain about it is absolutely traumatising

8148691 a scheme for early release of substantial numbers of staff in the ministry of defence
8148692 the decision under challenge is the defendants decision to call for volunteers from the affected groups of staff for selection for release on what are known as flexible early retirement or severance terms
8148693 the scheme ers is required because there is said to be a surplus of staff in the affected groups and the defendant is seeking to achieve substantial reduction in the numbers of civil servants in the relevant groups through this process of volunteering and being selected either for early retirement or severance
8148694 even though members of staff wish to accept such terms and are not subject to compulsory retirement

8148834 it is impossible to return 400 acres of land to the farmers who have been agitating in front of the tata motors nano project site in singur west bengal chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee said here on tuesday
8148835 returning 400 acres means dropping the entire project i cannot afford to roll back the project now it is too important for the state
8148836 im trying to make the opposition parties understand that the automobile company and its ancillary industries should be in a continuous piece of land otherwise it will not be viable i think i will finally succeed in convincing the opposition about the importance of the project
8148837 west bengal will be the first state from where tata motors will roll out the rs 100 000 small car we cannot miss this project this car factory and the ancillary factories will attract many other companies in the future and the ancillary units will not only supply products to the nano factory they will also serve other companies
8148838 this singur is an exceptional case this is not the original feature of the state as a whole
8148839 there are 13 000 farmer families involved with this project and it is impossible to reach out to every farmer individually but our officials have attended several meetings over there and talked to the aggrieved farmers

8148865 w hrend die deutschen hersteller ihre durchschnittlichen co2 emissionen um 3 2 prozent bzw 5g co2 km gesenkt haben verharren die franzosen mit einem gramm nahezu auf dem niveau von 2006
8148866 nat rlich haben hersteller von berwiegend kleineren und mittelklasse fahrzeugen in absoluten zahlen niedrigere co2 emissionswerte als die von gr eren fahrzeugen
8148867 niemand w rde auf die idee kommen den effizienzgrad einer schlecht isolierten einzimmerwohnung mit dem eines energietechnisch auf den neuesten stand gebrachten mehrfamilienhauses zu vergleichen genau dies tut t amp e aber wenn sie franz sische italienische oder japanische hersteller die in europa zwischen 35 prozent und 55 prozent kleinst und kleinwagen verkaufen mit den deutschen herstellern vergleichen die einen kleinst und kleinwagenanteil von lediglich knapp 20 prozent haben

8148874 dass die koalition die einf hrung eines allgemeinen gesetzlichen mindestlohns und die deutliche erh hung des arbeitslosengeldes ii mit verweis auf fadenscheinige argumente unterl sst ist weder christlich noch sozial das ist einfach nur sch big ein mindestlohn dass zeigen unsere europ ischen nachbarn kostet keine arbeitspl tze und eine starke volkswirtschaft kann sich ohne weiteres menschenw rdige sozialleistungen leisten

8148917 well do our best to address those concerns as the indians are trying to do to address concerns that other governments may have about the agreement
8148918 i think we have to see how this plays out its very important as i said to come to fruition on this agreement and so it wouldnt do any good for me to speculate on what may or may not happen at this point

8148966 jadi penyatuan bursa se asean yang berarti hanya ada satu bursa di asia tenggara tidak mudah sehingga sulit direalisasikan dalam waktu dekat

8148974 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8148975 we were all very interested to see her reasons for supporting barack obama and so i think its very clear tonight that she was a strong messenger that we have to change our country and that its ok even though we supported hillary clinton in the past to unite behind barack obama
8148976 even though i cant vote im trying my best to support obama and get the word out about how great he is and what an inspiration hes going to be
8148977 ive met a lot of women who switched from hillary to mccain just because they were upset so i think its really really important that she came here its a great thing she had everyone on their feet clapping for her it was an inspiring speech and i think that it spoke to everyone
8148978 people were clinging to her every word in many ways
8148979 she put things in proper perspective she clearly said that it wasnt about her it was about the many americans who are suffering the many americans who want change in this country and so i think that weve left a better and more united party
8148980 it will take us some time but we will be a united party and because of both leaders were going to be a stronger party and well feel that power in november
8148981 we all knew we had two really great leaders here even when our family was divided we were not the ones making fun of each other for that choice
8148982 as long as were not voting mccain i think were all cool about that we really got lucky with hillary and obama this year its great that theyve come together
8148983 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8148984 a lot of people wouldnt even know theyve been attacked

8149080 we have had roughly the same players for the last 18 months but the roles are changing slightly it looks a side with depth in bowling and batting as well as fielding so we must not let up
8149081 we can only apologise for what was a poor performance
8149082 a defeat like this can be demoralising but we have come back before
8149083 this is a good first half performance demonstrating our competitiveness against a background of weaker economies and increased input costs
8149084 we have maintained the momentum of our topline growth and again ensured that the heineken brand outperforms the market and increases its share of the international premium segment
8149085 the grocery business is highly competitive and we frequently refine our promotions based on the market
8149086 this protects the stores profit margins and increases our shopping costs
8149087 our food costs are up about 25 from last year
8149088 thats a pretty good sale price you just have to stock up

8149097 we strongly believe that uranium mining could be an opportunity for our people to generate equity and commercial benefit and importantly play an important part in the development of significant resources projects for this state
8149098 legislating a ban becomes even more hypocritical when the prime minister apologises to the indigenous people of australia and overturns a long held ban on uranium mining due to it becoming obsolete
8149099 that is one reason why as a people we are exploring opportunities away from the government sector for us to play a pro active role in our future an opportunity we believe has been taken away from us by the premier yesterday

8149136 we have players here who need time to bed in and eddie johnson is one of those but we will soon see the best of him
8149137 the squad has been tested especially with the three injuries in the first half but we like to give our youngsters a chance and i am pleased that aaron morris was given an opportunity
8149138 i am very proud of my team as they put up a great performance against a side from a higher division
8149139 we conceded from two set pieces but despite that we defended well
8149140 we expected them to be better than us but generally i was very satisfied with the way we played
8149141 we were missing one or two first team players but it gave me the chance to see how others perform and that was worthwhile

8149143 this discovery is very encouraging and a great step forward in our quest to create new cancer treatments
8149144 because of the role his5 plays in keeping cell growth at a normal rate we expect that these compounds will greatly slow down the growth of cancers cells
8149145 our preliminary data reveals that several of these compounds do indeed markedly slow down the growth of human cancer cells
8149146 importantly we also know through computer modelling that nearly all of these compounds have drug like qualities

8149153 flies had bitten him he ended up with maggots in his wounds which is a good thing people are saying but they ended up laying eggs in the good layers of the skin as well
8149154 he has several medical problems all interacting with each other and has a long way to go

8149173 reducing or freezing credit lines may be a prudent response for lenders managing their risks

8149199 i wish we could roll back gas prices to 1955 when dad worked on the bridge but thats not going to happen
8149200 it costs you extra money to do anything today the price of fuel has certainly affected my other travel plans we dont travel like we did before it used to be that you didnt hesitate to go up to northern michigan but weve curbed it quite a bit this year its gotten so a tank of gas exceeds the cost of the motel room
8149201 while the overall travel numbers are down slightly from last year it is important to note that more michigan residents are spending their vacation dollars in michigan
8149202 i guess when it comes to gas prices my philosophy is that it is what it is and its out of my control
8149203 faced with todays revelations helen clark must stand mr peters down as a minister
8149204 that is what i would do if i were prime minister helen clark has stood ministers from labour down for much less
8149205 governments and ministers must enjoy the confidence of the parliament and ultimately the public faced with todays revelations it is no longer acceptable for mr peters to offer bluster and insults where simple courteous honest answers are required
8149206 i was kind of afraid of obama the first time i saw him and i was afraid to trust him and i was afraid to have hope when i first kind of became aware of him

8149208 we could not detect any preventive effect of intervention with folic acid plus vitamin b12 or with vitamin b6 on mortality or major cardiovascular events
8149209 i condemn russias decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states and call upon all countries of the world not to accord any legitimacy to this action
8149210 moscows action deserves condemnation from the entire international community and russia must understand that its violations of international law carry consequences
8149211 todays decision the culmination of a long effort aimed at splitting these two regions away from georgia represents a major step forward in that process
8149212 ken shamrock was our number one choice for this fight and i am very happy to announce that he has agreed to take on kimbo slice states jeremy lappen head of fight operations for elitexc

8149214 i welcome this opportunity kimbo has had some success hes big hes strong and he hits with heavy hands but anybody that is a veteran in this sport understands that unless you have a lot of time in the ring you have not been tested completely

8149220 hes lost the belt now so i cant beat him and win the title back in one fight but i want to fight him just as bad as when he was champion

8149230 i was in a private area in the parents room behind the curtain and this cleaner just walked in on me and watched what i was doing
8149231 she told me the parents room was for parents and breastfeeding only and that i wasnt allowed to eat lunch in there
8149232 they told me that a little kid had been running around in the parents room and had briefly seen what i was doing and had complained to its mum she said
8149233 the mum then complained to security and the cleaner came in to inspect what i was doing they told me the complaint was that there was a topless woman eating her lunch in the parents room
8149234 its tough enough that i have to do this during my break but for a complaint to be made about me doing it is really upsetting
8149235 theres a public ignorance and theres still a lack of knowledge around breastfeeding and how it works she said
8149236 this mother was very humiliated and something like this could have seen the end of her expressing milk or working
8149237 its already very stressful and then to have someone complain about it is absolutely traumatising
8149238 the accused threw caroline byrne off the gap because he had the motive
8149239 it was him who didnt want the relationship to end

8149244 if mr bush thinks i will add something to the ticket i am sure he is right
8149245 we look at the overall quality of employment and were surprised to see that it has improved despite the weakening economy
8149246 one of the reasons for that was the fact that a lot of the new jobs were in the public sector which has relatively high quality jobs
8149247 this probably will not last the days that governments run high surpluses are over in fact i would expect government hiring to slow down significantly over the next two to three years
8149248 the public sector as a percentage of employment is critical in terms of how that impacts our economy and our labour market and we need to be focusing on reducing that further than 19 per cent rather than being pleased with 19
8149249 when you look at place like nevada wisconsin and massachusetts theyre all sitting at 10 or 11 per cent of employment alberta has canadas smallest public sector at about 15 5 per cent but when you start looking at places like newfoundland and saskatchewan saskatchewan has the highest proportional public sector in north america at 27 4 per cent

8149259 i highly recommend this team they over deliver on all of their projects
8149260 what i think is important is that consumers realize the limitations of credit reporting and monitoring not so much that they watch their identities because its not realistic
8149261 consumers are subjected to so much marketing about credit reporting and i think that its a result of lobbying by the credit reporting agencies
8149262 i think the only people that will end up paying for it are those that earn over 100 000 per year in income and have high security concerns
8149263 you see more concern in people over 55 the least concerned are the 18 24 crowd so the older you are the more worried you are because you know all the things that can happen
8149264 what if somebody modifies your name and social over the course of a few weeks and then takes out a loan when they default on the loan the loan collector will trace it back to you and theyll claim that youre the one who fraudulently tried to escape who you were
8149265 the banks will think that somebody is trying to trick them and it is more likely to be you than somebody else
8149266 your credit report can be adversely affected and it takes a significant amount of work to get that cleared
8149267 if somebody opens up a utilities type account in your name and then doesnt pay the bill you wouldnt have a way to know because it wasnt billed to your address then your credit history shows a defaulted payment and there is no way to get that off unless you dispute it with the institution and theyre not that quick to act it isnt exactly the most important thing on their list of to do items
8149268 its like parking your car in a parking lot and it was still there when you came out of the grocery store
8149269 did somebody walk by and see a blinking light and decide not to steal the car maybe its a tough one to get statistical data about what i look to is our renewal rates and our subscriber rates

8149275 i wanted to create something that represented those flavors i grew up with
8149276 avocado is not used behind bars because people think its too creamy or that its a vegetable
8149277 but its a fruit the mescal is very smoky and goes well with the avocados creaminess
8149278 a weird flavor by itself but blends perfectly in this drink
8149279 it gives brightness to the avocado balancing its thickness with a touch of saltiness
8149280 the idea was to represent all of latin america not just one country or flavor
8149281 i wanted to make something more organic and hand crafted
8149282 that even people who suffer diabetes can drink all these cocktails
8149283 i meet these guys who are only one year behind a bar and they call themselves a master mixologist
8149284 a chef starts as a cook then gains knowledge and respect its the same for a mixologist who should work behind the bar a long time
8149285 you have knowledge not only of vodka and rum but food wine spirits ingredients a little bit about history and this way you can incorporate all that knowledge into creating a beautiful cocktail
8149286 if youre able to taste a painting what would it taste like thats what im doing here

8149297 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8149298 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8149299 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8149300 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8149301 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8149302 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8149303 nothing to improve the prospects of peace in the caucasus
8149304 i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances
8149305 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8149306 short of losing our dignity as a nation we couldnt act otherwise
8149307 but russian leaders are guilty too because they kept this conflict warm for many years and tried to use it as a political instrument
8149308 the law recognises a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
8149309 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth
8149310 if youre talking about a true threat there has to be some evidence theyre not just talking about it or thinking about it especially in a drug induced state
8149311 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot

8149316 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days
8149317 we had to leave the house before it got worse
8149318 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
8149319 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8149320 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8149321 this is probably the weirdest incentive you have ever heard of but it worked
8149322 ive been wanting to pose for nn for ages but i told myself i wouldnt do it unless i had a really successful semester at college well i pulled down good grades better then i expected so this is like my reward to myself of course my boyfriend thinks it is a reward for him too coz this guyll be getting to screw a magazine model whenever this guy wants i think this is way better than being a football cheerleader
8149323 you can pick it how you want to pick it
8149324 you can say were pressing or theyre pitching good you know what probably a little bit of both
8149325 theyre throwing the ball good against us and were fighting it a little bit trying to do too much that normally happens but youve just gotta work your way through these things
8149326 hopefully wednesdays a day where well come out relaxed a little bit and swing the bats a little better and have a better performance
8149327 i wouldnt say theyre must win games yet but theyre getting pretty close
8149328 hes effectively in and out of the zone his balls surprising hes got some zip hes learned to throw breaking balls
8149329 we saw him a few years ago we rule 5 d him and you know what hes come a long way as a pitcher hes a big strong pitcher and he kind of shut us down
8149330 i felt like i had really good stuff probably the best in a half dozen starts
8149331 i never felt like the game was out of control or i wasnt able to get out of the innings
8149332 im starting to feel like not necessarily a finished product but back to where i want to be
8149333 this is a fabrication by the sudanese government and some criminals
8149334 we denounce and condemn this act we want the protection of civilians wherever they are this is a dirty conspiracy to defame
8149335 twelve years ago there were 1 2 million wildebeests last year we had only 300 000 if nothing is done it could put pay to the migration forever
8149336 we could be looking at a repetition of the bison and buffalo disappearance in
8149337 the maasai had to make a choice because the pastoralist lifestyle was no longer sustainable
8149338 the new arrangement is that having wildlife earns you money whether there are tourists or not
8149339 wheat and maize you can grow anywhere in the world but these people dont have the efficiency per acre that others have and when prices drop theyll be the first to lose out
8149340 in any business the more exotic a product the higher price it commands with this wildlife they have one of the best exotic products in the world
8149341 maasai mara is a brand just like coca cola theres no reason it cant generate its own income
8149342 we used to take predators as our enemies but maasais are natural conservationists
8149343 but now we see animals as very precious they are a life support to many
8149344 this directive was very much needed for the mara but it should have been targeted only at the protected area because a blanket freeze is going to put into question the development of responsible conservancies

8149357 one of the things that we sensed was that students were not as engaged at the university as students were at other universities
8149358 we wanted to have some sort of intensive program that would really connect them to the university connect them with each other and connect them with the faculty and staff
8149359 contrary to what i hear a lot of institutions are doing
8149360 the movement generally across the country has been to reduce the amount of time between when students are allowed to move in and when classes actually start what weve found is that the more time you give the students the more time they have to see minneapolis in ways you might not want them to see minneapolis
8149361 we really thought about how we can get the students on campus give them the content they need and help them make the connections without it being a drinking fest
8149362 dorms food service transportation this all has to be paid for
8149363 its related to graduation because its going to connect students much earlier on with the array of opportunities they can have culturally socially or academically at the university that engagement and as quick as you can do it is really key to success in college today
8149364 research shows that the more the student is involved and engaged in student activities in leadership positions the better theyll do in their academic work and the sooner theyll graduate
8149365 thats not always self evident but we want to introduce them to these opportunities so maybe theyll realize gee maybe i should balance some of these outside the classroom opportunities

8149401 if youre in an office and the majority of people arent wearing ties and youre in a tie its really that added confidence boost
8149402 when they have to make a presentation when they have to go on an impressive date when theyre going on an interview they will always select a tie to complete their outfit
8149403 you put a suit on youre very focused on business and youre there for business

8149419 cannabis is a leafy plant which grows wild in many of the tropic and temperate areas of the world it is cultivated both indoors and out for the production of its flowering tops the most commonly used form of cannabis are the leaves and flowering tops buds which may be either smoked or eaten it also comes in a more concentrated resinous form called hashish and as a sticky black liquid called hash oil there are three distinct species of cannabis cannabis sativa cannabis indica and cannabis ruderalis though there is some argument as to whether these should be considered varieties rather than species most recreationally used cannabis is the result of interbreeding between these three types the term hemp is generally used to describe low thc varieties of cannabis which are grown for industrial uses

8149518 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories

8149699 wright enthusiasts have turned out in vast numbers to consider bidding on these two wright homes weve auctioned
8149700 they are finding that the auction process is a tremendous way to establish quickly the true value of wright homes which because of their uniqueness have long been extremely hard to value this has strong and increasing appeal to wright homeowners who often have to market their homes for years on the conventional market in order to identify the value that the auction establishes in just one day
8149701 the acre of wooded land adjacent to the property could allow a buyer the option of new development
8149702 the auction is consequently attracting interest from investors and homeowners alike

8149721 but and i have to make this point as a small criticism mark may be a good bloke but hes also a little bit of an asshole what i mean by that is the history of the swp and other left organisations is full of people in privileged positions who have known all about the organisational skulduggery that goes on and havent said a word until they have been targeted themselves i think there is a particular responsibility on people like mark steel or paul foot or eamonn mccann who function as a human face of their organisation and make people feel good about being in it and who could function as a sort of conscience of the organisation but normally they dont paul foot who i miss a lot was a lovely man a brilliant journalist and one of the best speakers ive ever heard but it must be said that when confronted with the swp leadership and with cliff in particular paul could be the most awful creep eamonn has gone along with all sorts of hair raising stuff as long as hes been allowed to plough his own furrow in derry and so on
