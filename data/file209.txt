2090049 difficult and painful he knew it would be opposed but he did not run from his responsibilities he had the issue studied and he studied it deeply and afterwards he had the courage to make a decision understanding well that he was going against the dominant culture and against what public opinion was expecting

2090095 i felt a bit anxious but seeing many many friends just beside me and the many prayers from bishops conferences around the world that sent messages to say we are with you and we pray with you thanks be to god i dont feel alone in this mission
2090096 the problems are not only for me they must be for all christians outside and for the church the church must be involved in finding a solution involved in helping the christian community to stay there and i have asked a lot of bishops to feel co responsible everyone must feel that jerusalem is his own mother church
2090097 we have had many bishops conferences and groups of pilgrims coming to the holy land

2090101 we are happy to see that in one year more or less the politicians the international community have taken into account the religious aspect now when they come to the holy land they ask to meet us
2090102 they start to consider that maybe this religious leader can have an influence on our faithful and change the mentality for more cooperation

2090105 for me the wall is stupid stupid the wall is a realization of many other walls in the human being before building this wall they had a wall of hate of mistrust of ignorance and they put all of these internal walls obstacles in something that you can see

2090107 we cannot go on i think everybody is tired tired tired

2090115 there are millions of individuals living in the u s with diabetes that take injections
2090116 when developing the survey we had two goals in mind the first was to encourage patients to take a more proactive role in communicating with their healthcare team about their concerns regarding insulin injections the second was to dispel the myth that healthcare providers were unaware of or were unwilling to address the quality of life issues surrounding insulin injections it is our hope that the results from this survey accomplish both these goals and that patients and providers will begin talking regularly about these important issues if we can improve the quality of life for 33 percent of people with diabetes who are insulin dependent then we can be one step closer to lessening the impact of the disease on our patients lives
2090117 diabetes is unique in that it requires significant commitment and adherence by the patient to keep it in control if patients are not comfortable communicating issues related to their quality of life over time they may adhere less and less to their regimen putting them increasingly at risk for complications
2090118 as this survey shows a percentage of individuals living with diabetes and taking insulin are altering what they eat during the day to avoid injections or even skipping the injection entirely even if that only happens rarely omission of insulin depending on the circumstance may have an impact on a patients overall health and potentially leave them at risk for serious diabetes related complications
2090119 i am not surprised that many people with diabetes are not talking with the doctors or diabetes educators about their injections
2090120 for years i skipped meals or injections to avoid the hassle and discomfort of taking them but when it came to talking with my doctor about it i did not speak up as much as i could have when i did finally talk to my diabetes educator about my injections i learned there were other less painful ways to manage my diabetes effectively i am so happy i finally said something

2090207 the va has given democracy a victory wisely the va has avoided a court fight which we pledged to wage by permitting nonpartisan activities registering and educating veterans at its facilities these veterans at inpatient facilities deserve no less the very rights they served and sacrificed to protect and preserve the vas flexibility fits its constitutional obligations which we will fight to enforce if necessary for now the federal government is respecting veterans and the law
2090208 our veterans have sacrificed so much to preserve our to vote in many ways they are our most patriotic americans we now have less than 90 days until the most important election in a generation we must make sure every proud veteran under va care has a real opportunity to make his or her voice heard at the after all civic involvement is part of good health
2090209 as a practical matter voter registration drives have historically been a critical outreach tool for veterans in facilities to ensure that they get the opportunity to register to vote many veterans simply are not able to get out on their own rendering registration much more difficult likewise the longstanding practice of allowing facility employees to assist veterans in registering to vote has provided valuable assistance to veterans in need

2090226 in the final rotation with the russians on floor exercise the u s women held a commanding lead over the russian team but those on the gymnastics floor including bela karolyi strugs coach believed that the u s team still needed a good score on the vault to win gold the russian women were capable of very high scores on floor exercise and they had two of their strongest athletes yet to compete at that point it was not impossible for the russians to take the gold if the us women collapsed strugs teammate dominique moceanu fell on both of her vaults registering poor scores kerri strug was the last to vault for the united states strug fell on her first attempt despite falling strugs first vault worth 9 137 points was quite enough to slip the women into the gold medal 2 nevertheless she stood up shaking out her ankle which she had wrenched in her fall she limped to the end of the runway for her second attempt she landed the vault perfectly on one foot sealing the womens team gold with a score of 9 712 strug raised her arms after her vault saluting the judges hopped around and raised them again then collapsed in agony to the mat grasping her ankle and was helped off the stage karolyi carried her onto the podium to join her team for the medal ceremony after which she was treated at a hospital for a severe laterial sprain and tendon damage

2090241 whoever sells the most t shirts usually ends up winning
2090242 even among voters who say they do plan to vote for mccain more than half say they are
2090243 its logical to assume that young people are more likely to wear t shirts than old folks
2090244 if you look at the cool versus non cool aspect of this mccain isnt exactly cool
2090245 al gore and john kerry sold a lot of t shirts too
2090246 why does the media keep telling us how much better obama is in everything but when you look at th polls he is basically tied with mccain
2090247 if barack obama makes it all the way to the white house it will represent a quantum leap in americas consciousness and a promise to restore americas position in the world

2090259 las cosas tienen que empezar a cambiar debemos adoptar medidas que se centren en el bienestar global de los ni os y eso incluye apoyar a sus familias garantizarles alimentos diagnosticarles la infecci n a tiempo y por supuesto tratarles
2090260 la mayor a de los peque os que son seropositivos se han infectado porque se lo han transmitido su madre a pesar de que se sabe c mo evitar estos casos que en los pa ses desarrollados han desaparecido pr cticamente las medidas no llegan a los pobres donde las madres siguen pasando el virus a sus hijos y culp ndose toda la vida por ello
2090261 nos hemos centrado mucho en los hu rfanos pero no podemos olvidar que hay muchos m s ni os vulnerables y afectados por el sida aquellos en cuyas familias hay un miembro con vih sufren las consecuencias de la enfermedad el rechazo de sus vecinos etc por eso debemos fijarnos en las familias y mejorar la situaci n econ mica de los m s desfavorecidos como primera medida para combatir la epidemia

2090266 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things

2090271 but you never hear about women doing it except in porn
2090272 i remember when i was at high school a lot of other girls said fingering yourself was disgusting i know its actually normal but does anyone really do it my friends dont mention doing it
2090273 there is not always sufficient emphasis on the relationship between the teaching of the church on redemption and creation this is an issue in which catholics can practice their faith giving examples with lifestyles respectful of the environment
2090274 but if one denies god the world is reduced to the material and in a world closed in on its materialism it is easier for the human being to make himself the dictator of all other creatures and of nature

2090287 may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail sea air postal telegraphic radio and other means of communication and the severance of diplomatic relations
2090288 call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures
2090289 agreed yesterday to seek new sanctions against iran over its nuclear program after the country failed to meet a weekend deadline to respond to an offer
2090290 we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
2090291 calling on the administration to focus on the urgency of the iranian threat and to impose tougher sanctions on tehran
2090292 to enhance united states diplomatic efforts with respect to iran by imposing additional economic sanctions against iran and for other purposes
2090293 authorize s state and local governments to direct divestiture from and prevent investment in companies with investments of 20 000 000 or more in irans energy sector
2090294 support ing israels quest for peace and press ing the arab states to do more to support israeli palestinian talks
2090295 the radical regime in iran has sponsored terrorism against the united states israel and the west for decades
2090296 the worlds leading state sponsor of terror noting its support for groups such as hamas hizballah and islamic jihad
2090297 insurgency in iraq supplied arms to the taliban and hosted al qaeda terrorists
2090298 relentlessly pursu es nuclear weapons and thus is a particularly implacable and lethal regime
2090299 only a sustained unified international effort to isolate and sanction iran is likely to convince it to give up these dangerous activities
2090300 speaking from the heart as a true friend of israel when i visit with aipac i am among friends good friends who share my strong commitment that the bond between the united states and israel is unbreakable today tomorrow and forever
2090301 by israel in the face of all threats speak s up when israels security is at risk and voices concern that americas recent foreign policy hasnt made israel more secure hamas now controls gaza hizbollah has tightened its grip on southern lebanon and is flexing its muscles in beirut because of the war in iraq iran which always posed a greater threat to israel than iraq is emboldened and poses the greatest strategic challenge to the us and israel in the middle east in a generation we must isolate hamas syria continues its support for terror and meddling in lebanon and pursu es weapons of mass destruction there is no greater threat to israel or to the peace and stability of the region than iran it supports violent extremists pursues a nuclear capability and threatens to wipe israel off the map my goal will be to eliminate this threat
2090302 foremost in his mind is the threat posed by the regime in tehran the iranian president calls israel a stinking corpse it uses violence to undermine israel in the middle east peace process it supports extremists in iraq killing american soldiers remains the worlds chief sponsor of terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons poses an unacceptable risk a danger we cannot allow
2090303 the most dangerous regime in the middle east characterized by its cruel despotism and fanatic militancy if this regime acquires nuclear weapons this would presage catastrophic consequences not only for my country not only for the middle east but for all of mankind the fact that iran is building nuclear weapons is beyond question and they may be the worlds first un deterable nuclear power so the danger is clear and the question is what do we do about it my message to you is divest iran
2090304 iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium so the security council has no choice but to increase the sanctions
2090305 national tragedy demagogically justified an economic catastrophe a regional disaster and a global boomerang for the united states
2090306 a historic strategic and moral calamity undertaken under false assumptions it is undermining americas global legitimacy tarnishing our moral credentials and intensifying regional instability
2090307 plausible scenario for a military collision with iran based on iraqi failure to meet the benchmarks followed by accusations of iranian responsibility for the failure then by some provocation in iraq or a terrorist act in the us blamed on iran culminating in a defensive us military action
2090308 a lonely america into a spreading and deepening quagmire eventually ranging across iraq iran afghanistan and pakistan
2090309 when the president flatly asserts iran is seeking nuclear weapons hes overstating the facts we have very scant supportive evidence and after the iraq calamity he should be very careful about the veracity of his public assertions
2090310 if his secretary of state is joe lieberman and his secretary of defense is rudy giuliani we will be moving towards the ww iv counting the cold war as ww iii that they have been both favoring and predicting an appalling concept
2090311 the us did not give the green light for an israeli attack on iran george bush made it clear to all parties that the first option is diplomacy
2090312 it is the absolute responsibility of everybody in uniform to disobey an order that is either illegal or immoral
2090313 not obey illegal and immoral orders to use weapons of mass destruction they cannot commit crimes against humanity
2090314 if sanctions and incentives cannot be made to work the voices for military action will only get louder no matter what aides may be telling mr bush and mr olmert or what they may be telling each other an attack on iran would be a disaster
2090315 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months conventionally
2090316 assault fail to significantly harm or stall the iranian program a nuclear attack will most likely follow
2090317 only one option if it wishes to halt irans march toward nuclear weaponry the military
2090318 which leaves only israel the country threatened almost daily with destruction by irans leaders irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program
2090319 will destroy their nuclear facilities even though this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation
2090320 the nuclear incineration of 70 million iranians and the contamination of the better part of a billion people in the middle east asia and europe
2090321 that appeared to be a rehearsal for a potential bombing attack
2090322 escalating tensions that would peak with an iranian inspired insurgency strike against us
2090323 generations of jihadists and our grandchildren will be battling them in america
2090324 at least ten senior flag and general officers including combatant commanders
2090325 we are going to eliminate vendors in myrtle beach and were asking the county to do the same
2090326 then i guess shes just gonna turn her back on us because for her to say she doesnt have a dog in this fight thats absurd
2090327 maybe myrtle trace or carolina forest some of those areas for the bikers to go would be good and then shed have one big dog in the fight wouldnt she

2090334 in sum the court concludes that plaintiffs delay of at least eighteen years is unreasonable because the length of delay far exceeds the statute of limitations period a presumption of laches applies this presumption is not overcome by any excuses plaintiff offers for its delay
2090335 we need to make the entity that is in the best position to mitigate the risk to be responsible for that risk
2090336 and that means making the financial institutions and companies who hold the data liable for fraudulent transactions this will result in a lot more prosecutions and a much safer environment these prosecutions in the u s are just the tip of the iceberg and more needs to be done
2090337 the charging of the individuals involved with the retail id theft is great news for business however it is also bad news why because this basic problem should not have happened it is irrelevant whether the charged individuals gained access via the wireless network or any other method it was a failure of the organisations involved to implement basic controls and then maintain and monitor them
2090338 whocanisue com does not generate leads to potential clients a method commonly used in online legal marketing that violates ethical rules governing most attorneys advertising instead whocanisue coms patent pending model allows attorneys to bid on real time ad placements usually limited to five attorneys delivered to users who have completed question paths to determine their qualification for a particular claim the user then reviews the profiles of the attorneys and can initiate an instant message or telephone call with the attorney or can request that the firm contact the user about his or her claim
2090339 he vowed to resist invading iraq then drummed up false pretenses to do just that he decried the shiite led regime in iran while at the same time putting the shiites in charge of iraq he vowed no nation building then set about occupying iraq he said no negotiating with terrorists then cut deal after deal with insurgents in afghanistan and during the surge in iraq and made nice with their financial backers in pakistan and saudi arabia one could go on and on

2090341 we do not make this request lightly however we believe that there is significant evidence to suggest that mr johnson has provided statements that are inconsistent with sworn testimony and documents provided in connection with an investigation conducted by this committee
2090342 johnson tried very hard to convince us that the california waiver was denied based on decisions that were mine and mine alone
2090343 it appears that mr johnsons account of the california waiver decision is factually inaccurate or misleading
2090344 we take the inconsistency between mr johnsons testimony and other evidence very seriously

2090420 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states
2090421 a new made up offense that didnt exist when he committed it
2090422 will be important because lots of people will be charged with it
2090423 knowing that by providing said service or transportation he was directly facilitating communication and planning used for acts of terrorism
2090424 this process demonstrated that military commissions can effectively bring very dangerous terrorists to justice
2090425 wouldnt be popping champagne bottles if i were in charge of this process
2090426 the admission of evidence that seems to have been obtained by coercion
2090427 i havent really seen why this case should not have not been tried in federal district court
2090428 any verdict resulting from such a flawed system is a betrayal of american values

2090433 i dont think its right hes been sacked from his club but i dont see why they should make him unemployable in australia riolo said
2090434 i thought the nrl would be trying to keep quality players and work with players in our game rather than sending them out to siberia on penance
2090435 if youre sacked from any job youre not being made unemployable in the whole industry and he hasnt committed a crime
2090436 canberra has chosen to sack him and thats their prerogative and theyve got grounds to do that under the playing contract between todd and the club
2090437 but that shouldnt really to me have anything to do with him being employed by anybody else
2090438 the nrl are saying they wont register his contract but i dont know if thats really fair riolo said
2090439 ill be looking in to that but again we dont want to get into a legal situation
2090440 that probably wouldnt help the nrl or todd or anyone but i wouldnt mind to clarify on what ground he would be de registered

2090457 la mujer es dadora de vida es guardiana de semillas
2090458 i didnt mean to frighten you but im very very desperate
2090459 the first point is that the fund managers have taken this action not because of any problems or concerns with the quality of assets or investments but purely as a defensive measure in response to extraordinary market conditions
2090460 there is no suggestion that any assets or investments are impaired
2090461 it is clearly understood that nobody likes to lose capital so an orderly wind up is most likely the answer to protect all
2090462 it is unfortunate that the loss of investor confidence has resulted in all funds lending on property being considered equal where the good the bad the evil and possibly the fraudulent have been lumped together as bad
2090463 bank deposits are only as secure as the bank itself as they are not directly secured by a physical asset
2090464 im not suggesting any bank is in trouble but they have had to write off large loans whereas the provision for bad debts in mortgage funds has been very small in proportion to the banks write offs
2090465 just seeing her face light up and sensing her total relief
2090466 i remember most medals by women one olympiad 5 shirley babashoff 1976 5 dara torres 2000 5 natalie coughlin 2004 4 chris von saltza 1960 4 kathy ellis 1964 4 sharon stouder 1964 4 jan henne 1968 4 sue pederson 1968 4 nancy hogshead 1984 4 summer sanders 1992 4 angel martino 1996 4 amy van dyken 1996 4 jenny thompson 2000 that a lot just her face
2090467 when i think of that girl who came walking in after the 2000 olympic trials i get goose bumps
2090468 shes a different person theres an ebb and flow to a career that expands that long its important to look at the whole process natalies always been someone whos enjoyed the journey and its been a really good journey
2090469 its tough to be introduced as an olympic champion and match that every time you step on the blocks
2090470 because shes so mature i think shell thrive we as americans want natalie to be extraordinary and she sees that as her position i dont know how she does it its hard to live up to others expectations but shes always lived up to her own thats what makes her great
2090471 the gold medal in the 100 back was something she needed to get to feel right about her career
2090472 hopefully ill be able to take in the experience a lot more than i did last time and really enjoy it
2090473 no matter what ill always have the five medals ive already won im an olympian for life theres still a lot of pressure placed on me perhaps even more this year but im able to deal with it
2090474 so much importance is placed on the olympic games if youre a gold medal winner or if youre not youre validated in the sport or youre not its such a weird mindset now i have that over and done with
2090475 i just remember hearing matt biondi failed to eclipse mark spitzs record and gets bronze
2090476 i was a square peg trying to fit into a round hole natalie still has it its a much more difficult position to be the best as athletes our greatest ally is momentum when youre climbing the ladder you can keep going up when youre the best its easier to become stagnant winning is one thing repeating is another natalie is well on her way of proving shes capable of doing that
2090477 as we promised from the beginning we have been collecting your feedback and have made many of the changes you asked for one of the biggest changes is our new search functionality it is very cool in that it puts avvo users just a click away from the lawyer legal information and legal advice theyre looking for looking for information on divorce in seattle just type in those words click and youll be presented with top rated divorce attorneys in seattle legal guides related to divorce and questions with answers other people have asked about divorce
2090478 successive meetings of three plus one have not been able to establish any terrorist link to the region
2090479 it cannot be presumed and it has never been shown that any financing has gone to any military or violent initiative
2090480 the challenge that weve had to meet is with transnational organized crime
2090481 i have confidence they are going to make plays when the ball is thrown their way
2090482 not everyone has experience but they have a ton of talent im excited to see them play theyve paid their dues and theyve worked hard
2090483 they are going to make mistakes and were going to stay positive with them they all have talent they all have size and speed the guys who can keep up with the learning curve are the guys who probably are going to be the contributors
2090484 its just kind of worked out that way in recruiting
2090485 we have bigger more physical guys where before we had smaller more shifty guys they are young and inexperienced but they do have a ton of talent there are a lot of good players out there and they are hungry to play they havent got a ton of playing time so theyre kind of itching to get on the field thats a good thing because they want to work and they want to get better
2090486 a meeting of musical minds that begs for a follow up
2090487 my dad was the one who really turned me on to crimson back in the mid 90s when i was listening to a lot of primus and phish i remember spending the better part of one summer just sitting around listening to every recording and reading the fxf and tgd booklets end to end just soaking it all up in addition to absorbing crimson it gave me a reference point to really explore the music of the previous generation

2090507 we demand the academic freedom to gain knowledge and a society that doesnt allow scientists to do that has got a problem
2090508 the people who are responsible for the recent vandalism are acting criminally aside from impairing scientific research and damaging property they are now putting innocent people at risk
2090509 the industry is very anxious that unfavorable facts dont get out there one tactic is to tar any critic as irrational
2090510 its really tough to get our viewpoints represented in the media
2090511 the biotech industrys claims about genetically altered crops are perennially overstated in truth agricultural biotechnology has almost nothing to offer to the world food crisis in the short term
2090512 when gmos were developed in the u s we didnt know what was hitting us it was in our food service before people understood what gmo meant
2090513 by the time gmos became standard we had no choice we couldnt have labeling because it was already happening by the time it got across the pond in the uk they had the advantage of seeing it happen here first
2090514 voters usually get what the voters deserve but will that be the case in 08

2090517 the dvr produces a wealth of rich data about who the audience is
2090518 belangrijke boodschappen snel en correct doorsturen is een vereiste voor de verkeersveiligheid
2090519 we mogen ook niet vergeten dat 24 procent van de europese rijtijd wordt gespendeerd in de file de kosten hiervan kunnen tegen 2010 oplopen tot tachtig miljoen euro
2090520 there is not always sufficient emphasis on the relationship between the teaching of the church on redemption and creation this is an issue in which catholics can practice their faith giving examples with lifestyles respectful of the environment
2090521 but if one denies god the world is reduced to the material and in a world closed in on its materialism it is easier for the human being to make himself the dictator of all other creatures and of nature
2090522 when he was younger he was stricter and thought that it was a problem to administer the sacraments so widely with time the pope said i understood it was necessary to follow the way of the lord and be open to the mercy that embraces those who only have a hint of faith as well
2090523 there is hope that the economic impact will prove to be less significant than in other sectors
2090524 that should mean they are seen as a sound investment especially at a time when the credit crunch should favour early stage venture capital

2090544 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
2090545 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
2090546 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

2090571 set top box free advertisement campaign of dish tv in the print and electronic media is misleading
2090572 as far as the advertisement in the print media is concerned which carries dish tvs advertisement
2090573 that offers free set top boxes on a close scrutiny of these advertisements we notice that all such advertisements carry the payment scheme of rs 3990 in a box it is obvious that prospective consumer who reads the details of the advertisement will be aware of the payment plan of rs 3990 printed in the box alongside the advertisement and will reasonably conclude that the set top box is offered free of cost with this scheme therefore we do not find any misrepresentative being made to the prospective consumers in regard to the scheme
2090574 not carry any advertisement for its set top box free offer without indicating the scheme of rs 3990

2090579 these have been achieved prior to the proposed 220 million capital injection into our company
2090580 we see it as a great opportunity to make real progress in not only adopting a strategy but also progressing consolidation in an organised and structured manner

2090586 officials are being accused of transforming the capital into a fortress surface to air missiles take aim at the sky above the olympic stadiums surveillance cameras are mounted on light poles scan sidewalks and police officers are searching thousands of cars and trucks entering the city

2090588 i think the olympics are the most important international sports event in four years
2090589 and its the biggest focus of the international media in four years so this might draw some attention from terrorist groups

2090594 its his musical personality his songs to me have the same quality as dowland and sting is an englishman in the end just as dowland was and john dowland was widely travelled at the time just as sting is now
2090595 at first he was like a little baby but then that little baby started walking very very fast and within a few months he was having great ideas and telling me what to do hes a really hard worker very serious and sincere and made such great progress that were now performing some lute duets together
2090596 in the circus we were playing for 10 minutes a night which meant that i had all day by myself to think about and to play music bachs music is so great that it sounds good on any instrument but even so i was frustrated playing it on the guitar so i started on the lute
2090597 bach was the lure and now the lute is my mistress
2090598 we have electricity within our own bodies and remember too that bach himself as an organist played a mechanical instrument
2090599 his voice was always around as a kid but i never really played any of his songs as im doing now
2090600 like dowland himself hes a great english songwriter and im really enjoying it

2090618 ptc has supported the dita standard since its inception in 2004 and has continued to work closely with oasis to drive the adoption of dita across organizations that want to simplify xml based technical document publishing we are proud to have a ptc team member on the oasis dita adoption committee and look forward to continue the great work that oasis does
2090619 they say that their facility has been in the neighborhood for 120 years and plans to open a community center down the road
2090620 first of all gay street thats not a proper name because im anti gay
2090621 but there are no residents with the address of gay street right now so thats not an issue
2090622 it is time for iraq to take responsibility for the costs and burdens of rebuilding their country
2090623 using us taxpayer money to pay for the rebuilding of the infrastructure of another nation is bad enough
2090624 but it is reprehensible and unforgivable when that nation is running a budget surplus while we have a substantial and growing federal budget deficit and a crumbling infrastructure
2090625 the american public was told reconstruction efforts in iraq would be paid for by oil revenues from that country now more than five years later americans are shouldering the responsibility of rebuilding iraq while facing decaying bridges and skyrocketing gas prices
2090626 its a series that could really put them in a bind
2090627 people say this is july or august that its not the end of the year that this isnt that big of a series but really it is
2090628 theyre always big when you play in your own division and especially against a team thats chasing you in standings
2090629 why do those games mean any less than any other games you ultimately want to win as many games as possible
2090630 they are a little more intense than usual and i think we feed off that
2090631 everyone understands that these are important games for us but if we win the series or lose the series we still have work to do
2090632 we cant clinch anything against st louis but we understand the importance of this my mind set is the biggest game you have is the next one and that its the most important of the year
2090633 you ultimately want to win as many games as possible
2090634 and some are going to miss them so there are some events that will never be seen by a single player playing a single game and thats cool but when you have a game with no cutscenes you have to have very very tight level design for times when the player has to see something
2090635 we were focus testing the game every single week almost from the very beginning sometimes the sessions would just be half an hour we would give the players a ton of credits and tell them go to the in game store and just buy stuff just to see if the store worked the way it should other times we had people playing for six hours just to see what happened where they lost focus and a lot of feedback came from that which influenced how the game developed
2090636 but by the third time we got feedback saying yeah isaac moves really fucking slow we couldnt keep our heads buried in the sand any longer
2090637 and so we changed that but it had ripple effects throughout the entire game suddenly the monsters ai was no longer effective they seemed stupid because they couldnt react quickly enough to a character running around them we had to lengthen the hallways because the level wouldnt stream quickly enough when the player was running everything had to be adjusted and i was really proud because the team swallowed that pill and the game was stronger for it
2090638 i was really resistant but the day after we put it in i was playing a level and stuck in a tight spot and i used the health button and i loved it it was the first of many times we swore we wouldnt do something and then we did it and i loved the result
2090639 we spent a lot of time a lot of energy on the ending and we didnt even show a lot of our own guys the ending until recently
2090640 angelitos que iban en ese helic ptero son militares y oficiales de ese ej rcito oficial de colombia que pr ctica las violaciones a ni os y las masacres para
2090641 there is a lot of violence in our society and this workshop gave me many skills that i can use to help my people especially women to save them from violence and self immolation
2090642 i learned during the workshop that everybody has some qualities of a leader but we need to empower our selves the leadership of professor sakena yacoobi really gave us more energy to take steps to work hard for our people i have a good economic situation and i decided to start a baby center to help those women who work outside their home i hope i can do this and because of the energy i got from this workshop i believe that i can do it
2090643 based on willis statements in his return and his brief together with loves florence countys election director statements in his affidavit that florence county needs substantial lead time before it can hold another election holding another election is for all intents and purposes impossible
2090644 a s a general rule courts have held that they are without power to grant substantial relief once the time passes for the name of a contestant to be certified for the election of officers to be placed on the official ballot
2090645 ok lo legge e decide se pubblicarlo quindi non lo pubblica
2090646 weve already spent our budget because theres a flood of requests during the economic crisis
2090647 en igualdad de condiciones ha sido uno de los factores que hemos tenido en cuenta vamos a apostar por el mercado nacional
2090648 the courts are moving to the position where government can fund religious activities and endorse religion without restraint
2090649 i think publishers have concluded the only games that work are the surefire 500 million box office kind of games like spider man and shrek
2090650 i dont think they expected the dark knightmovie to be this big
2090651 we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families
2090652 because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom
2090653 thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
2090654 desire to build a life with a loved one to provide for a family and to have children who will grow and thrive are desires that all people share regardless of race sex religion sexual orientation or gender identity
2090655 that the cost of the american dream must never come at the expense of the american family for decades weve had politicians in washington who talk about family values but we havent had policies that value families instead its harder for working parents to make a living while raising their kids its even harder to get a break
2090656 i love to watch the flames dance they are beautiful
2090657 maybe some of the players relaxed just a little bit failing to appreciate that the all blacks would come at them even more strongly in light of their setback in the first game
2090658 if so and only each individual would really know the answer to how the circumstances impacted on their performance i know as a group we will have learned much from the experience
2090659 as far as our progress as a team goes the auckland experience was a setback but it need not be any more than that
2090660 i would like to think the reverse wont impact too greatly on the confidence that has been built up within the group but that is something well really only be able to judge retrospectively
2090661 thats the challenge that lies ahead for the men of gold
2090662 it is one i am confident the team is up for as we assemble next wednesday ahead of one of the greatest quests that exists in world rugby the challenge of winning test matches on south african soil
2090663 getting on the front foot there allowed new zealand to dictate much of the game through the tactical nous of dan carter
2090664 we then compounded the problem with some of our decision making under pressure
2090665 it didnt always come off but the approach said a lot about their positive attitude
2090666 those qualities and habits should stand them in good stead as we further build the team and develop our game
2090667 i was at the qatar golf open tournament earlier this year and had the opportunity to meet him he was very humble and down to earth i couldnt believe i was in the same room as this legend hes a true hero and his life as an athlete is so inspiring i still remember watching him run in the olympics and cheering for him it was a special moment meeting carl lewis

2090709 the ultimate goal is to equip those who attend to maintain and improve their fitness level people get more motivated when they go to the personal trainer but when they leave the ultimate goal of the trainer like the goal of the church is for the person to live outside what theyve learned inside the gym
2090710 the church and the parent should work hand in hand the pastor provides a level of instruction that the parent probably cant fully provide his goal is to equip the parent with an appropriate level of instruction the parent is not only to be an instructor but a model

2090712 people in the gym who are looking in the mirror all the time
2090713 christ cant flow through you into the world if your heart is clogged with spiritual plaque
2090714 it requires that we know the heart of god but also that we acknowledge that our own hearts are unfit

2090724 was k nnen wir tun dass es unser tag wird
2090725 consistent with this states strong policy against any form of discrimination in the workplace we hold that the threshold for demonstrating a religion based discriminatory hostile work environment cannot be any higher or more stringent than the threshold that applies to sexually or racially hostile work environment claims
2090726 even in a work setting in which derogatory humor was a norm the humor file defense fails to be dispositive of cutlers claim of hostile work environment
2090727 antagonistic degrading or demeaning conduct in the workplace that is directed at or about ones religious faith or ancestry can be discriminatory and can amount to an unlawful hostile environment
2090728 those statements were not accidental in parlance they were aimed to have an effect on their listener and their listener was known to the speakers as a person of jewish faith and ancestry the uttering of those repeated comments clearly constituted a form of harassment for the person whose ancestry and religion was being demeaned and insulted
2090729 the appellate division calls it teasing but that moniker undervalues the invidiousness of these stereotypic references and demeaning comments that were directed at cutler or said in his presence
2090730 one of the lowest times in mankinds history the holocaust
2090731 time and time again such inappropriate workplace cultures have given rise to liability for a hostile workplace
2090732 in sum the comments demonstrated an anti semitic bigotry that has no place in a workplace of this state
2090733 you cant make a joke in the workplace even if its not mean spirited
2090734 the court is really raising the bar for workplace standards even if a joke is made in jest thats a hostile work environment
2090735 critical step forward in protecting jewish workers in new jersey
2090736 reaffirms the commitment of the new jersey supreme court to ensuring that anti semitism has no home in the new jersey workplace
2090737 in the end while the court made it clear that religion related comments are impermissible it did not disturb the finding that jason cutler suffered no damages

2090739 court rulings like this over text messages and earlier ones facilitating polygamous marriages send a pretty clear message to men that they can treat women disrespectfully and get away with it
2090740 simply removing god wont remove the greed and lust for power inherent in men
2090741 men do not need religion to subjugate one another scarce resources and greed is the single greatest cause of war in the history of mankind religion just makes for a convenient rallying cry
2090742 we keep prostitutes for pleasure we keep mistresses for the day to day needs of the body we keep wives for the begetting of children and for the faithful guardianship of our homes so long as a man supported his wife and family there was no shame whatsoever in extra marital affairs
2090743 anonymous well gingrich delivered divorce papers to his wife in the hospital and one of giullianis wives found out she was being divorced from the news reports why then do we have a problem with texting
2090744 islam recognizes the importance of strong healthy families in order to build a strong healthy society
2090745 in islam marriage is a blessed bond and social contract the woman and man both have to consent to the marriage and cannot be forced into it if it is her first marriage some scholars go for the opinion that the woman must also have the consent of her father or guardian this is to protect her from marrying out of passionate love someone who is unsuitable prophet muhammad pbuh advised muslims to choose a wife on the basis of her piety someone may choose a wife for her wealth beauty or high family but all these qualities may disappear piety is lasting if the man and wife are both pious they will make every effort to keep their marriage intact and not divorce for trivial reasons but islam recognizes that men and women sometimes err in choosing a marriage partner islam also realizes that changes within them or in their circumstances might later make them unhappy together should they be forced to remain together there are countless examples in literature jane eyre and angela s ashes come to mind and real life in which couples were not allowed to divorce they either remained miserable together or one usually the husband abandoned the other without any support for the children isn t it better for couples in truly unhappy marriages especially when there is physical or verbal abuse or alcoholism involved to be able to divorce and try to start over with a new partner wouldn t that be better for children than to witness violence every day thus islam takes a moderate stance on this although divorce is halal lawful yet the prophet pbuh said among lawful things divorce is most hated by allah reported by abu dawood the qur an directs married couples to live together with love affection and mercy between them and to be patient with each other s faults but if they have problems living together harmoniously they should seek counseling from their families in an effort to keep the marriage intact these are efforts to bring success to the marriage before considering divorce islam recognizes the importance of strong healthy families in order to build a strong healthy society that is why the qur an and hadith traditions of the prophet show us how to live together divorce should be used only as a last resort not just whenever one is going through a difficult or unhappy period
2090746 matti dumped me in a text message where he said thats it

2090748 we havent mentioned it yet but well definitely look at it and talk about it at tonights meeting at the hotel
2090749 i think everyones aware of how good they are finishing games and last time they charged us down from six goals behind so were going to be aware of that but we think weve improved our second halves since the middle of the year and hopefully were ahead at three quarter time and can hold on
2090750 round 11 probably sticks in the players minds and i think also carlton have got a fair bit on it trying to play for finals so you add those together and hopefully our guys respond pretty well
2090751 it doesnt mean the end for those guys who come out we mainly want to see mitch farmer play down back fabian deluca in the ruck and nick salter up forward and we think thats exciting
2090752 tobys pretty critical to our backline its a matter of looking at damon white and bentley and lonie weve seen what theyve done over the last four weeks and theyll probably get another crack before the end of the year and well decide what happens after that
2090753 white has got four weeks to show us if hes a backman or a forward if he can play both it would be great get the best of foxtel

2090774 i talked for hours to your wallet photograph and you just listened you laughed enchanted by my intellect or maybe you didnt
2090775 im more concerned about turning over the ball the way we have the last three games than with how our defence has played
2090776 we turned the ball over five times in the last two games so we should feel lucky to be 1 1 in those games turnovers are the real issue in football
2090777 my feeling is theres little difference between the team thats 6 0 right now saskatchewan and the team thats 1 5
2090778 its about 12 plays that separates all the teams from being just like us 3 3
2090779 were going into a tough situation on friday night against a championship calibre team
2090780 we could have closed out those games so we put that on ourselves
2090781 no matter how many points we put up we need to improve
2090782 we could have sustained more drives killed more clock and that would have really improved our chances of winning we did a good job against hamilton last week with three minutes to go and we have to do the same
2090783 with all due respect to ryan he is not the best quarterback on the winnipeg blue bombers

2090790 my research that led to this award would not have been possible without the continuous support of fsu in particular the physics department which allowed me sufficient time for research away from administrative and teaching duties
2090791 this is a well deserved honor for dr berg that also brings increased stature and international recognition to our department and university
2090792 this award reflects the outstanding contributions dr berg has made to physics and to computational science
2090793 we learn in school that the nucleus of an atom is made up of positively charged particles called protons and we also learn that positive particles repel each other
2090794 so the question is why does the nucleus not fall apart
2090795 multicanonical approach is popular in structural biology bergs computer based research also led him to take on a second faculty position within the school of computational science

2090810 then youve warned me like a good boy about that danger consider your jiminy cricket satisfied and tell me what i want to know
2090811 you know i wont leave you alone until i get it
2090812 thats why it makes her mad she doesnt understand it
2090813 ive heard you guys talking about her dad and her mom she doesnt understand it because while she knows that he looks at porn she also knows that her parents have a very healthy sex life
2090814 youve met them almost as many times as i have theyre a nice couple a little strange but still nice
2090815 you ever walk in during one of their arguments the beginning middle or the end
2090816 a fiery explosion followed by a long cold silence then another fiery explosion
2090817 they fight about the porn a lot from what ive seen sherrys mom doesnt get it either
2090818 look it was one of the arguments i walked in on sherrys mom was screaming about it shes as clueless as sherry is when it comes to this
2090819 yeah but that doesnt matter he loves her they bang like bunnies according to sherry and what ive heard myself when ive spent the night over there why does that make a difference
2090820 ok fine shes a 200 pound dwarf what do i care attractive she isnt it would be like boning a hornless rhino
2090821 he loves her ive never seen anyones parents that were so happy he cant keep his hands off of her when i sleep over im afraid to go in their kitchen in the mornings because they might be in there getting frisky with each other thats not it
2090822 you wanted the truth and im giving it to you det now listen to me
2090823 yes he loves her ive spoken to the woman shes articulate intelligent funny as hell with a twisted sense of humor and her own pair of brass plated balls shes fearless and shes ruthless and she refuses to take anyones shit ever i love her a little bit myself because those are some awesome qualities her personalitys stellar she can be darker than midnight during a smugglers moon and when she laughs the whole world seems somehow brighter because damnit she really doesnt laugh that often but shes not physically attractive det not at all not by anyones estimation including her own so yes he loves her but sometimes he just cant stand looking at her sometimes he wants to fantasize that hes with one of those hot young babes that he finds on pornographic web sites sometimes he absolutely needs to not because he doesnt love her if he didnt love her hed go looking for an affair and im willing to bet he wouldnt have to look very hard so when she asks about the porn he doesnt answer her he cant answer her he cant hurt her not like that shes been hurt before shes told me about some of it ive seen her eyes det shes a brick wall on a foundation of quicksand its too much she wouldnt come back from a hurt like that not if he delivered it it would kill her and he cant do that he loves her he loves her more than life itself ive seen him look at her i know it its there for the world to see but sometimes sometimes he needs to look at something better something brighter something something beautiful because she isnt and she never ever will be
2090824 you asked for honesty and i gave it to you you asked det and i warned you fuck i think you cracked my jaw with those fucking rings
2090825 i hit you for her luke yes shes physically unattractive and maybe even ugly but what did she ever do to him or to you to deserve being lied to youre a bastard luke
2090826 yes shes got everything to do with this she created this she created you goddamnit luke
2090827 i knew you were mean i didnt know you were also evil
2090828 the first game is never easy and you never know how it is going to be
2090829 you train for three weeks and you try to find the right recipe it was important to get the three points
2090830 it was pretty intense toward the end of the game as they were pushing a lot of bodies forward there were a lot of scrambles in the box but the referee made the right decisions to let certain plays go on
2090831 theres a weather system moving in up through oregon theres been some lightning
2090832 what happens when they establish a red flag warning that means we have a high potential for extreme fire growth so within that weve got low humidities high wind and then with the lightning on top of that the potential is huge for extreme fire behavior
2090833 we take a real proactive approach and we start tracking the storm
2090834 technology is great in the respect that we can track the storms as they come in and kind of pinpoint where some lightning strikes have happened and then we put patrols out on that area where the strikes are happening to make sure
2090835 our view is that if we get resources on them as quickly as possible well keep the fire small
2090836 we started the red flag task force and what that does is put them on alert
2090837 if we had a fire in our district other agencies would be sending resources automatically again the more resources we can get there as soon as possible will hopefully keep those fires small
2090838 one thing we learned during our first year on the air is that fans cant get enough of these classic games this is another group of thrilling victories and amazing finishes that big ten fans will enjoy watching
2090839 ive been extremely lucky to be able to sell 1 000 copies of my first poetry collection better to travel it was a self published book and it was an up hill slog that took nearly six years to accomplish it certainly didnt happen overnight the first 200 copies sold pretty quickly at local events including a featured spot at the atlanta literary festival back in 2003 after that it was selling them at readings and signings talking bookstores into stocking it not easy for a self pub and utilizing my website blog and mailing list and getting media to write stories i was already a fairly well known journalist and freelance writer in atlanta so i had plenty of contacts to tap into i was also fortunate enough to get a couple of really glowing reviews including a cover mention in lambda book report i spent a good bit of my own money traveling and getting the word i also became adept at self promotion you really have to put yourself out there and be willing to take off your poetry hat and put on a marketing hat many poets find that distasteful but with the state of poetry publishing today if youre not willing to support your own work dont expect the press to do so either i still get the occasional royalty check from iuniverse several bookstores in atlanta keep the book in stock and copies continue to sell at my readings
2090840 hey ping print these girls up some passports that say they are 16 will ya
2090841 just the movement downward in oil over the last couple of weeks i view as helpful in the whole equation
2090842 we are planning to spend a great deal of time looking at that over the next couple of months
2090843 we are operating in a very difficult environment and our results generated one of the smallest reductions in second quarter margins among north american carriers
2090844 the second quarter result demonstrated the difficulty of increasing revenues at the same rapid pace as the increase in the price of jet fuel however our customers will eventually have to absorb the higher cost
2090845 we have long cautioned that domestic supply growth could outpace demand growth in 2008 and hence air canadas decision to trim capacity growth is clearly a positive for the industry as a whole
2090846 the first we heard about it was when gpg advised the independent directors it had had such an approach
2090847 we have enjoyed working with gpg and thank them for their significant support and assistance as an investor and on the board over the past five years

2090849 el objetivo ltimo sigue siendo el mismo desarrollar una vacuna segura eficaz que prevenga la infecci n y que sea accesible para todo el mundo
2090850 mientras la investigaci n en este campo nos ha dado muchos conocimientos sobre el virus tambi n nos ha dado muchas lecciones de humildad hemos pecado de ingenuos y lograr el objetivo va a llevar mucho m s tiempo del que hab amos imaginado
2090851 si logramos la primera demostraci n de que un candidato a vacuna beneficia a las personas a la hora de prevenir la infecci n o retrasando el curso de la enfermedad habremos dado un gran paso aunque luego no llegue a convertirse en la vacuna s habremos demostrado que sta es posible
2090852 comprender mejor el vih sus armas y sus puntos d biles para dise ar un producto que realmente d al sistema inmune la protecci n suficiente
2090853 pero el vih es el pat geno m s complejo al que nos hemos enfrentado nunca en 25 a os sabemos m s sobre su biolog a que de ning n otro agente y a n la vacuna se nos escapa pero hay que seguir
2090854 es cierto que hace un a o ramos m s optimistas que ahora para lograr una vacuna pero como investigador y como ministro seguimos apostando por esta v a
2090855 debe centrarse en encontrar respuestas en averiguar por qu han fallado las vacunas y poner m s enfasis en el conocimiento y en el estudio del virus
2090856 hey did you see barack obama playing basketball with our troops in iraq did you see that one shot he made from 40 feet 40 feet let me tell you something if shooting baskets now is a requirement to be president a white guy may never have that job again
2090857 barack obama is very popular in the middle east i guess a lot of people over there saw the cover of the new yorker
2090858 well this is baracks third day in the middle east and president bush says he has no timetable for bringing him back home
2090859 john mccain called a press conference today unfortunately all the press were out of the country covering obama you know i feel kind of sorry for mccain i mean all day on tv they show nothing but footage of barack obama touring the middle east being with the troops in afghanistan meeting with troops in iraq the only time i saw mccain on tv was when willard scott wished him a happy birthday on the today show

2090868 bruce ivins may have targeted sens tom daschle and patrick leahy with anthrax laced letters in 2001 because he saw them as bad catholics owing to their votes in favor of abortion rights officials close to the investigation say
2090869 we unreservedly apologize both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy
2090870 desire to be known for a perverted form of sexuality
2090871 it is a cause for regret that a section of the community desire to be known for a perverted form of sexuality which in certain incidences has provoked the unacceptable and totally unjustifiable response of violence
2090872 such a response however must not intimidate the church into silence
2090873 the act of sodomy is a grave offence to every bible believer who in accepting the pure message of gods precious word express the mind of god by declaring it to be an abomination leviticus ch18 v 22 thou shalt not lie down with mankind as with womankind it is an abomination
2090874 the issue of human rights is no longer a basis for this parade as successive governments have legislated for the lowering of the age of consent the authorisation of civil partnerships and the inheritance rights of a nominated partner
2090875 this parade is not a welcome addition to our city neither is it a positive celebration of a profitable lifestyle flaunting a form of sexuality that generations of men and women have righteously resisted and by gods grace will continue to resist
2090876 it doesnt define people as complex individuals who are brothers sisters sons and daughters
2090877 it defines people by a sexual act which is deeply offensive
2090878 it certainly creates a climate of hatred by defining people as perverts it gives others licence to attack
2090879 its divisive and goes against and undermines equality legislation its also damaging to community relations
2090880 i think the ad does breach a number of codes on so many levels i know for me i feel that it was a very public attack the language is so strong and its disgraceful
2090881 regardless of the views of anyone it does not in one way matter what anyone believes god does exist
2090882 the fool hath said in his heart there is no god they are corrupt they have done abominable works there is none that doeth good the lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek god they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread and call not upon the lord

2090884 i am really excited that sainsburys are supporting farmers like myself to convert farms to freedom food scheme and im sure it will be a great success in store
2090885 sainsburys commitment to upgrade the minimum welfare standards of all their fresh chicken to the rspca welfare standards over the coming years will improve the lives of millions of british chickens and this new initiative is clearly the first major step along that road i welcome it wholeheartedly
2090886 when we met jamie oliver and hugh fearnley whittingstall last year we said that sainsburys would do everything it could to improve chicken welfare while providing our customers with choice and good value
2090887 we knew that higher welfare chicken sales would go up following the channel 4 food series in january however we are thrilled to see that customers have continued to buy chicken reared to higher standards it demonstrates the strength of feeling for animal welfare issues and that with greater availability of affordable options our customers dont have to compromise
2090888 it is tremendous to see sainsburys showing such leadership by taking chicken welfare seriously moving towards rspca freedom food as a minimum standard will genuinely improve the lives of millions of chickens and shows a clear response to consumer concern in this area
2090889 i have been involved in chicken farming for 25 years and have always been committed to improving welfare standards i am really excited that sainsburys are supporting farmers like myself to convert farms to freedom food scheme and im sure it will be a great success in store

2090898 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness

2090930 it has nothing to do with being gender confused or gay as the bulk of wearers are straight men in long term relationships

2091002 one of the most noticeable consequences of climate change in the uk is the frequency of mild winters as a direct result of this aphids seeking new sources of food are appearing significantly earlier in the year and in significantly higher numbers we have been studying the seasonal biology of aphids for a long time now and we know that populations can continue to grow over the winter and spring provided that conditions are warm enough after a warm winter there are much larger numbers flying and they are hence detected much earlier this means that there are more aphids flying in spring and early summer when crops are particularly vulnerable to damage
2091003 environmental change is one of the big challenges facing the world today these long term data on the seasonal appearance of flying aphids not only show that there are already noticeable changes in the uk climate but they also provide the knowledge which will help to mitigate the consequences

2091040 the state understood from the outset that in the event of reversal it could be asked to compensate the co examiners and their assistants for the work it advocated they undertake
2091041 it was well within the states discretion to agree to a temporary halt to proceedings after the verdict until such time as the supreme court decided the appeal instead the state elected to continue

2091059 de marktwerking gekoppeld aan bezuinigingen door het kabinet pakken heel slecht uit voor de ziekenhuizen en dat vormt een bedreiging voor zowel de kwaliteit als de bereikbaarheid
2091060 want juist de kleine zeer waardevolle ziekenhuizen die zo belangrijk zijn om de ziekenhuiszorg goed bereikbaar en laagdrempelig te houden lopen gevaar ze dreigen te worden opgeslokt door grotere ziekenhuizen of komen in particuliere handen zoals het ziekenhuis in weert en het slotervaart in amsterdam waar winstoogmerk het uiteindelijke doel is

2091233 hes accountable to himself and his teammates i dont focus on the players who arent playing i focus on the 42 that are
2091234 we were just being selfish everyone wanting to make the play and not just buying into the program and getting the job done

2091250 this is a broader and more important collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models
2091251 the cells will allow researchers access for the first time to cell types of interest to watch the disease progress in a dish to watch what goes right or wrong well see in the years ahead that this opens the door to a new way of treating degenerative disease
2091252 even though the ips methodology gives us a facile way for making disease specific lines it does not eliminate the value or need for continuing to study human embryonic stem cells
2091253 those are really the gold standard for pluripotent stem cell types they have no genetic modifications and at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue beyond that are going to be extremely valuable tools human embryonic stem cells allow you to ask questions that we never can ask with ips cells

2091332 id like to thank everyone for being here today you couldnt ask for a better weather day thank you so much for your support of northwestern athletics and northwestern football i think we enter 2008 as a hungry football team and we took some positive steps through the off season first with the development of our leadership with the way our guys competed on a daily basis prepared us for a solid spring practice where we learned to work together with our new offensive and defensive coordinators and our new defensive line coach as a coach summer is a critical time you dont have any time to work with your guys its about trust and our guys came back understanding that ninety six percent of our guys passed our conditioning test so im encouraged by that because its the highest weve had since ive been the head coach its a credit to our strength coaches nick zostautas the amount of experience we have coming back 19 total starters is encouraging to start camp now as i evaluate our first four days of practice its important that we continue to grow weve installed a lot and there are a lot of new schemes going on in our first days of practice so i think soon we can start playing faster lee coleman were relatively healthy just a few guys dinged up but we hope to get those guys back sooner rather than later im excited about this senior class theyve been through a lot and they have obviously invested themselves as i said about the way they came back in shape i know that they will stay together and keep the ship moving in the right direction they came in as freshmen and enjoyed a great sun bowl run and i look forward to seeing those guys go out in a very positive fashion today is obviously the eve of our last practice in evanston and then comes the critical time for our football team to come together as we take our camp up to the university of wisconsin parkside for 10 days i like the attitude we have right now and now its just improving one day at a time while we put our focus on syracuse
2091333 we were excited with the way adam hahn back from spring injuries coupled with the performances from corey wootton and we have pretty solid depth and competition for the opener we should have about eight to nine guys we can rotate up front is it going to be corbin inside and marshall thomas outside or marshall inside and corbin outside well keep looking at combinations as we get closer
2091334 mikes run just about every scheme you can possibly think of so its a matter of finding out what our players do best he brought an attitude he brought an attitude that were going to be a good defense and its not going to happen overnight its going to take time and its going to take focusing on improving one practice one rep one day at a time and never being satisfied weve been improving since mike came on board were going to attack people and were going to adjust accordingly to what our opponents do but in the end its really more about what the players do on the field than the coaches
2091335 brendan early in his career has shown great ball skills with his ability to return punts and intercept the ball and now with his shoulder being fully healed today was as physical as ive seen him this week watching him perform these last few practices im encouraged it just adds depth to lose a player like that last year was a big blow to our secondary
2091336 well its about managing the game and making great decisions simple things that after we watch tape together he is trying really hard to correct pocket awareness carrying the ball throwing the ball on time hes done a great job on the technical side and hes done a great job managing our football team he reported in great shape and im excited about him
2091337 were not fixed yet were not ready to go out and get into a street fight and thats what you need up front we have guys working hard im really excited about our two young players that no one knows about al netter our left tackle who may be light on experience but he was competing for one of our jobs this spring and had a good start to camp and kurt mattes who started 12 games for us and hes being pushed every day im encouraged with that group well come together but i think we will have about six seven or eight guys who i feel really good about
2091338 its way too early for me to make that assessment were only practicing in helmets and shoulder pads right now i would think by next sunday after our carthage scrimmage i would have a pretty good idea at least going into the opener who we project to be competing at their position or on special teams im encouraged by the freshman class they came in in great shape and we had a solid group of guys pass the conditioning test including two offensive linemen who passed the conditioning test as freshmen which im impressed by at over 300 pounds we thought we recruited well but we dont really know until now when they report
2091339 theyre freshmen and theyre excited to be here theyre worried about buckling their chin strap right and being on time you can tell the guys that have been around the game a long time because they have a confidence about them hunter bates is back there taking punts and theres arguably no better special teams player in the history of the nfl than bill bates its such a huge adjustment to college football and thats why i think its an asset that we have that schedule where they dont have to take a class for 10 weeks after they get here they get acclimated to their teammates to college football to expectations of northwestern university and then they get up to speed on their study routines
2091340 its going to be a huge change for everyone weve gone back to the no huddle offense philosophically does that mean well snap the ball with 32 seconds on the play clock i dont know but we can snap it fast and pick up the tempo two out of the last three years weve had changes to the timing rules and im not a big fan of it i know fans want to see players play and i know players want to execute plays but were going to play by the books especially toward the end of games with a 40 second play clock were going to see a lot of teams eating some clock and taking delay of game penalties so it changes quite a bit then when you run out of bounds the clock is going to continue to run until the final two minutes of each half without a two minute warning thats a big change
2091341 the superback position is intended to be a hybrid of a running back wide receiver and fullback in the offense were going to put our men in positions where we can execute and have success drake dunsmore is 63
2091342 i dont want to put those kinds of expectations on him hes got the ball in his hand right now and he has that opportunity in front of him to stay healthy and grow he has the functional strength and the attitude to be a great offensive player he understands the importance of having the ball in his hand and the attitude it takes
2091343 the team i have needs to be the team they have to understand roles and team concepts and thats what weve got we all reflected on 2007 and there is a reason why we stayed home we have a hungry team weve had great lines of communication open between our players and our staff we have guys working and we have a great chemistry on the field and in the locker room that goes back to the leadership we have had well see what happens in the face of adversity because its easy on a 70 degree day with a cool breeze blowing out of the north during a well executed practice to feel good about yourself adversity is part of the game and well see how we stick together then
2091344 well from my position i want people to know that the head coachs office isnt the principals office my door is always open and i want people to communicate i think the players and the coaches have really bought into that it takes time to build that trust but its important
2091345 this is my 10th year coaching and third as head coach and i know our school has the best our country has to offer in terms of college football players guys are extremely giving of their time they arent just going to the best university that plays major college football but they are also asked to have a full time job which is play college football to see them manage their time and give back to the community thats one thing that impresses me and excites me about being the leader of the ball club number two ive learned to trust those around you we have great people in our program and you have to trust them and their vision in order to be successful
2091346 one is to consistently prepare we thought last year from our coaches to our players we failed to be truly consistent in our preparation it starts with me creating a vision and an action plan so we know exactly what we need to do number two down the road its our goal to win a bowl game its something that hasnt happened here in a long long time we needed to change the expectations and now its time to take that step when you get to that point you can reassess and start to name a bowl game and thats a byproduct of consistently preparing
2091347 oh well they will cut that before the opener we have some pretty exotic hairstyles in between when we get our pictures done and the first game when we come back from kenosha well look like wildcats and well be ready to go no im high and tight but im not going to the mohawk
2091348 every member of congress recognizes the historic challenges and the historic opportunities this election is obama said surrounded by house democratic leaders after the meeting in the cannon caucus room
2091349 not larger government but responsible government honest government and efficient government
2091350 most people in the caucus are pretty smart they read the polls they see whats ahead and i think senator obama knows hes got a lot of work ahead of him this is not put away by any means
2091351 it was a wonderful experience it was an opportunity for us as a caucus to show how unified we are behind his candidacy whether we represent red or blue states
2091352 he should scrap his agenda and instead call on his colleagues to hold an up or down vote on drilling proposals said rep

2091372 in questo momento della campagna elettorale i sondaggi ballano e non riflettono quello che poi accadr al momento del voto dice michael p macdonald politologo della brookings institution i recenti attacchi di maccain a obama hanno galvanizzato i sostenitori del candidato repubblicano ma non credo che riuscir a mantenere questa tensione per il resto della campagna elettorale vedremo degli altri alti e bassi nei sondaggi ma soltanto negli ultimi giorni si stabilizzeranno e allora forse sapremo chi vincer alla fine io scommetterei su barack obama ma questo non significa che maccain non abbia alcuna chance di affermazione semplicemente per lui sar molto molto pi difficile
2091373 credo che avremo unaffluenza record nelle prossime elezioni e probabilmente un sensibile spostamento di voti da destra a sinistra come raramente avvenuto in passato dice michael p macdonald mi pare che i primi segnali che arrivano vadano in quella direzione

2091615 there have been numerous attempts to distract the game from the fundamental issue which is that a contract is a binding commitment on the part of both the player and the club
2091616 it protects both parties and places responsibilities on both parties the issuing of a nsw supreme court order in respect of those responsibilities should provide a stark reminder to sonny bill of the importance of him observing the terms of his contract
2091617 it is a very serious matter for such an order to be granted and anyone who breaks an order of the nsw supreme court would face contempt proceedings from that court
2091618 the rules relating to that are really complicated and require a court in france to enforce a judgment in sydney will have to go through loads of hoops to make sure that works
2091619 the australians will find it quite difficult to get an injunction and stop him playing in france this weekend

2091660 agreed yesterday to seek new sanctions against iran over its nuclear program after the country failed to meet a weekend deadline to respond to an offer
2091661 we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
2091662 calling on the administration to focus on the urgency of the iranian threat and to impose tougher sanctions on tehran
2091663 to enhance united states diplomatic efforts with respect to iran by imposing additional economic sanctions against iran and for other purposes
2091664 authorize s state and local governments to direct divestiture from and prevent investment in companies with investments of 20 000 000 or more in irans energy sector
2091665 support ing israels quest for peace and press ing the arab states to do more to support israeli palestinian talks
2091666 the radical regime in iran has sponsored terrorism against the united states israel and the west for decades
2091667 the worlds leading state sponsor of terror noting its support for groups such as hamas hizballah and islamic jihad
2091668 insurgency in iraq supplied arms to the taliban and hosted al qaeda terrorists
2091669 relentlessly pursu es nuclear weapons and thus is a particularly implacable and lethal regime
2091670 only a sustained unified international effort to isolate and sanction iran is likely to convince it to give up these dangerous activities
2091671 speaking from the heart as a true friend of israel when i visit with aipac i am among friends good friends who share my strong commitment that the bond between the united states and israel is unbreakable today tomorrow and forever
2091672 by israel in the face of all threats speak s up when israels security is at risk and voices concern that americas recent foreign policy hasnt made israel more secure hamas now controls gaza hizbollah has tightened its grip on southern lebanon and is flexing its muscles in beirut because of the war in iraq iran which always posed a greater threat to israel than iraq is emboldened and poses the greatest strategic challenge to the us and israel in the middle east in a generation we must isolate hamas syria continues its support for terror and meddling in lebanon and pursu es weapons of mass destruction there is no greater threat to israel or to the peace and stability of the region than iran it supports violent extremists pursues a nuclear capability and threatens to wipe israel off the map my goal will be to eliminate this threat
2091673 foremost in his mind is the threat posed by the regime in tehran the iranian president calls israel a stinking corpse it uses violence to undermine israel in the middle east peace process it supports extremists in iraq killing american soldiers remains the worlds chief sponsor of terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons poses an unacceptable risk a danger we cannot allow
2091674 the most dangerous regime in the middle east characterized by its cruel despotism and fanatic militancy if this regime acquires nuclear weapons this would presage catastrophic consequences not only for my country not only for the middle east but for all of mankind the fact that iran is building nuclear weapons is beyond question and they may be the worlds first un deterable nuclear power so the danger is clear and the question is what do we do about it my message to you is divest iran
2091675 iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium so the security council has no choice but to increase the sanctions
2091676 national tragedy demagogically justified an economic catastrophe a regional disaster and a global boomerang for the united states
2091677 a historic strategic and moral calamity undertaken under false assumptions it is undermining americas global legitimacy tarnishing our moral credentials and intensifying regional instability
2091678 plausible scenario for a military collision with iran based on iraqi failure to meet the benchmarks followed by accusations of iranian responsibility for the failure then by some provocation in iraq or a terrorist act in the us blamed on iran culminating in a defensive us military action
2091679 a lonely america into a spreading and deepening quagmire eventually ranging across iraq iran afghanistan and pakistan
2091680 when the president flatly asserts iran is seeking nuclear weapons hes overstating the facts we have very scant supportive evidence and after the iraq calamity he should be very careful about the veracity of his public assertions
2091681 if his secretary of state is joe lieberman and his secretary of defense is rudy giuliani we will be moving towards the ww iv counting the cold war as ww iii that they have been both favoring and predicting an appalling concept
2091682 the us did not give the green light for an israeli attack on iran george bush made it clear to all parties that the first option is diplomacy
2091683 it is the absolute responsibility of everybody in uniform to disobey an order that is either illegal or immoral
2091684 not obey illegal and immoral orders to use weapons of mass destruction they cannot commit crimes against humanity
2091685 if sanctions and incentives cannot be made to work the voices for military action will only get louder no matter what aides may be telling mr bush and mr olmert or what they may be telling each other an attack on iran would be a disaster
2091686 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months conventionally
2091687 assault fail to significantly harm or stall the iranian program a nuclear attack will most likely follow
2091688 only one option if it wishes to halt irans march toward nuclear weaponry the military
2091689 which leaves only israel the country threatened almost daily with destruction by irans leaders irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program
2091690 will destroy their nuclear facilities even though this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation
2091691 the nuclear incineration of 70 million iranians and the contamination of the better part of a billion people in the middle east asia and europe
2091692 that appeared to be a rehearsal for a potential bombing attack

2091780 both newtons third law and the bernoulli equation or euler equations are required to analyze and discuss the concept of aerodynamic lift newtons third law is very useful to explain without analysis unsteady lifting motions such as a raptor taking off with prey in its talons however quasi steady lift is best explained by using field equations such as the euler equation or rans equations to calculate the pressure and velocity fields around an airplane wing or albatross limited flapping wing at a given free stream velocity these pressure field calculations are then integrated over the wing surface to obtain lift forces such a calculation would be nearly impossible to accomplish by analyzing the deflection of an unknown mass of air downwards as suggested by associate editor bjorn carey in his reply in the may 2008 issue of popular science circulation theory also explains why birds find it advantageous to fly in the upwash just outside the wing tip of an adjacent bird in the formation from another phd in fluid mechanics

2091789 whatever they are preaching there we dont understand any of it because they dont mention the prophet or our holy book
2091790 yes but this teaching if i heard them preaching it from our holy book i would say i understand it fine
2091791 i understand this teaching well and whenever i hear it is being preached i will go there and listen what they are saying is really the truth
2091792 because it isnt the path of our holy book the things they are saying arent what is written in our book
2091793 whenever you listen to this teaching you will gain wisdom and you learn how you should live your life our holy book says some things but they say you shouldnt tell it to the people if you dont tell the people what god wants and what he doesnt want how can a person learn to do right but those guys expose all the secrets so we can know how god wants us to be thats why we like to listen to this teaching
2091794 uncle much of what you preach and what our holy book says is similar but what is different is the way you make it all clear to us our holy book doesnt do that our preachers just say it is written but they dont clarify what it means and you dont see where it is written
2091795 you are an apostate you follow whatever teaching you hear
2091796 but you know that what we are hearing here you havent heard in our holy book
2091797 yes because that is how the prophet said we should preach thats why our preachers preach that way
2091798 yes thats true but you all need to make an effort to hear some want to listen and some dont but you should consider this we say this is gods message we dont say it is our message or some prophets message we say it is gods message when you hear that it is gods message you should listen to it and understand it then you can believe it or you can reject it but you all need to make the effort to listen

2091835 the intense fighting in the south ossetian conflict zone risks escalation into a full fledged war war would have a devastating impact for the entire region i urge the georgians south ossetians and russians to cease fire end military action and stop further escalation
2091836 we need to pull back from the brink of a full fledged war
2091837 the international community needs to act together to prevent a full fledged war i am in constant contact with my colleagues in the european union and the united states i have also called for restraint in the russian reaction
2091838 i condemn the shelling of the osce mission premises in tskhinvali the osce mission to georgia is intensively working with all parties to defuse tensions the missions work and mandate must be respected by all parties in the conflict i am ready to increase the number of osce observers as soon as the situation allows

2091840 werner faymann macht im moment ganz auf sympathisch und ich finde er ist es wirklich so ganz vertraue ich ihm aber nicht wichtig ist mir dass er h lt was er verspricht und klare standpunkte vertritt seit er die sp f hrt und nicht alfred gusenbauer der suderer ist es schon besser bei einem thema sollte faymann eine andere haltung einnehmen in der ausl nderfrage da ist sterreich zu sozial und bereit alles herzugeben
2091841 mir ist wichtig dass faymann mit der sp soziale fragen und den menschen in den mittelpunkt stellt in der vergangenheit gab es zu viele kompromisse auch wenn man bedenkt dass die sp in einer koalition war da h tte ich mir mehr durchsetzungskraft gew nscht faymann muss eine klare haltung zur eu einnehmen kritik muss m glich sein aber die europ ische einigung darf nicht infrage gestellt werden
2091842 die sp soll endlich ihr programm durchbringen und nicht dauernd kompromisse machen um an der macht zu bleiben dass faymann die studiengeb hren wegbringt ist mir nicht wichtig ich hab eh schon vier jahre gezahlt au erdem finde ich sie gar nicht schlecht so eine halbe l sung wie das gusenbauer nachhilfemodell ist l cherlich wirklich sympathisch ist mir faymann nicht so wie er von den plakaten heruntergrinst
2091843 ich erwarte mir dass werner faymann die sp als offene tolerante partei pr sentiert und dass die meinung der basis wieder mehr geh rt wird von den b rgerinnen und b rgern bekomme ich viele gute r ckmeldungen die hat es auch schon nach seiner rede zum 1 mai in wiener neustadt gegeben erste auftritte von werner faymann lassen vermuten dass die partei wieder besser zusammenh lt
2091844 ich k nnte mir vorstellen dass faymann auf der kommunikations ebene aus der sp wieder eine einheit macht weil er einen wesentlich verbindlicheren eindruck macht als gusenbauer er ist sehr medienwirksam versucht konzilianz und pragmatismus auszustrahlen die frage ist was er auf inhaltlicher ebene schafft ich glaube nicht dass er imstande ist der sp eine politische neuakzentuierung zu geben
2091845 ich wei nicht was ich von werner faymann halten soll als wiener stadtrat war er gut mir gef llt auch dass er bereit ist kompromisse zu machen die aktion mit dem krone leserbrief in der eu frage hat mir aber gar nicht gefallen dieses buhlen um die w hlergunst h lt er uns f r bl d dass wir so eine finte nicht durchschauen sonst macht er auf mich nicht den eindruck dass er falsch ist daher soll er k nftig geradliniger auftreten
2091846 faymann muss versuchen menschen an die partei zu binden die nicht zum kern geh ren so wie das unter kreisky passiert ist er muss bei der personalwahl ansetzen es ist verst ndlich wenn man sich an der parteispitze mit alten freunden umgibt das verengt aber den blickwinkel es darf nicht mehr so sein dass auf kritik schnoddrig reagiert wird wie bei gusenbauer der von oben herab studenten abgekanzelt hat
2091847 werner faymann ist immer noch ein unbeschriebenes blatt er ist ausdruck dieser diffusen konturlosigkeit der sozialdemokratie in ganz europa dabei sollte er profil f r die sp zur ckgewinnen wobei keiner so recht wei was f r ein profil gusenbauer ist aus sicht der basis an zu vielen kompromissen gescheitert was der geborene kompromissler faymann da ndern soll das ist das gro e weltr tsel
2091848 ich erwarte geschickteres umgehen mit der ffentlichkeit und den medien gusenbauer ist ein mensch mit vielen vorz gen war aber in manchen situationen ungeschickt er war in der sache gut im verkaufen der guten dinge waren er und seine berater eher schlecht faymann ist da weitaus gewiefter das merkt man jetzt schon er sagt fter das was man auch h ren m chte ob er mehr soziale kompetenz hat wird sich erst weisen
2091849 zu faymanns bisheriger praxis sich sterreichische printmedien durch gro z gige schaltung von pr inseraten seines ministeriums gef gig zu machen durfte ich als steuerzahler nur passiv meinen beitrag leisten ich erwarte mir daher von ihm in zukunft ebenfalls zuwendungen in millionenh he mit denen er sich auch um meine freundschaft bem hen k nnte die anrede onkel florian ist dabei nicht zwingend notwendig

2091859 as long as its greater than gravity then youre ok as soon as gravitys greater then it gives way
2091860 if you see a spot where the hills are scarred its probably a signal more problems are on the way nature tends to make itself obvious once in a while
2091861 people love the views from the top of a mountain and thats all very fine but you have to understand the problems you are facing when you do that
2091862 if youre going to build up there you need to know the risks you are taking
2091863 its pretty obvious though its a race against time the decision making pace of governments of the world is not keeping pace with the creation of the problem
2091864 we can only guess if we can keep pace how well can we adapt if climate change is inevitable can we adapt that is the question

2091899 this is the classic chicken and egg scenario where each link in the chain is looking to the other to take the first step before they commit
2091900 we intend to take a leadership role in engaging government and the business sector in driving change here in australia
2091901 we also believe you have to offer affordable solutions that recognise that people have different budgets
2091902 not everyone can afford a several thousand dollar premium currently required to buy a hybrid
2091903 and depending on their driving situation there might be better solutions for them anyway
2091904 in short wed be turning our backs on people who would be looking to local car makers the most for an affordable solution
2091905 that value equation has always been a part of the holden dna as much as great performance and handling
2091906 the idea that women need to be treated as delicate sensitive creatures just makes me feel patronized and separate from the rest of the community
2091907 how the rest of the world perceives it is what really matters and being a public blog that represents the community this matters to us as a whole
2091908 nobody needs to tell me what i can write and what i cant nobody except me myself and i needs to police my behaviour my actions and my writings
2091909 there are people offended by this it doesnt matter if you think its acceptable or not a significant proportion of people think its not you have a duty on a publically syndicated blog not to be offensive
2091910 women can take care of themselves hold on while i grope another
2091911 women want equality therefore we should otherwise you are medieval
2091912 i didnt had the guts to reach my backpack and take out the slr with really big lenses
2091913 how we perceive it is irrelevant how the rest of the world perceives it is what really matters
2091914 each and every act that isnt 1000 according to my holy values
2091915 again you are making propaganda out of this oh nooo be afraid of this pvanhoof dude he tries to remove my freedom to express my opinion
2091916 its not up to you to do damage control on behalf of people like me on behalf of communities please stop doing that
2091917 women can defend themselves therefore it is ok if we kick them
2091918 women can defend themselves therefore it is ok if we kick them
2091919 because they knew theyd be attacked by the community and that is what should be happening here
2091920 if theyd treat females equally to males theyd let the females handle this one themselves individually they wouldnt try to act as if they are the boys wholl protect the poor females against vicious attacks from the bad bad boys
2091921 is he really so arrogant to believe that his point of view must be correct and that everyone should have the same
2091922 if we cant make them love us well force them to pretend they do with threats of exclusion
2091923 the truth as spoken by the one who speaks it
2091924 well thats life boy cant please everybody anyway thats my blog
2091925 looks like we have no incentive to change to your proposed culture then right
2091926 you for example portray the gnome community as our employer this is just blatantly wrong
2091927 or some other public facing organisation of whom i was a member
2091928 you portray gnome as an entity that has a video camera installed in our living rooms this is wrong stupid and bullshit too
2091929 in fact are the kind of rules that you try to impose on the entire gnome community the kind that not even a single one of the companies involved in gnome impose on their employees
2091930 right now the consensus seems to be that instead of censoring syndicated people we are just going to trust them
2091931 in the end is loosing a contributor a bigger deal than pissing off somebody once per month or even per week
2091932 i too can make two li tags in html where one is basically insulting communities that dont follow your rules and one is basically praising the ones that are that doesnt mean its either truth or meaningful
2091933 may i advise you to indeed start a new community
2091934 bad things happen lets try to not let them happen again
2091935 were going to do this we dont care if you dont like it well do whatever the hell we like because youre prudes repressed facists censors and we love freedom and were easy going
2091936 you see in my culture this is totally acceptable so i still think what i did was not wrong and i might do it again however i apologize to all the people that i offended
2091937 we can not manage to not offend anyone its just not gonna happen
2091938 if you are offended by someone and gnome doesnt do anything about it you probably wont blame gnome that would be rediculous its a community not the person who offended you
2091939 now im sorry but when people feel they need to be

2091960 this is the first study in europeans to show a beneficial association on wet amd from the consumption of oily fish and is consistent with results from studies in the usa and australia two 3oz servings a week of oily fish such as salmon tuna or mackerel provides about 500 mg of dha and epa per day

2091962 its saving time saving money and it means more time with family and friends
2091963 what we do see from these figures is the projected average trip load is longer than expected that there are higher than expected commercial usage and for victorians of course it means greater choice
2091964 but now that the tolls are on its evident that people in the eastern and south eastern suburbs are reminded that this project was based on a lie
2091965 the misrepresentation that this was going to be a freeway and its turned into a tollway is still there the resentments still there the hurt is still there
2091966 a meeting of musical minds that begs for a follow up
2091967 my dad was the one who really turned me on to crimson back in the mid 90s when i was listening to a lot of primus and phish i remember spending the better part of one summer just sitting around listening to every recording and reading the fxf and tgd booklets end to end just soaking it all up in addition to absorbing crimson it gave me a reference point to really explore the music of the previous generation

2092192 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2092193 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2092194 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2092195 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2092196 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2092197 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2092198 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2092199 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system

2092212 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2092213 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2092214 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2092215 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

2092232 this is a stunning development for which we should all be grateful
2092233 that even as we keep working globally we need to do much more to fight aids at home and i intend to do so with my foundation
2092234 i have been extremely disappointed with the clinton foundation especially with it headquartered in harlem of all places that it has been silent
2092235 it is appropriate that president clinton is committed to taking this on
2092236 the challenges are huge but i have no doubt that we will live in a world without hiv some day
2092237 we need big investments for the future not only in the basic science of hiv prevention but also in clinical trials for an hiv vaccine

2092239 is that people who used one hundred percent financing or lied on their mortgage applications about their income or net worth have no room in their budget to accommodate a falling home price many of these people can hope for a short sale but the odds are against them especially if they do not act quickly and reach out for help from knowledgeable professionals
2092240 is that many banks are in just as much denial as the homeowners who are unable to make their mortgage payments they dont want to admit that they loaned far more than the home was worth in the first place and they want to avoid the pain unfortunately for homeowner and lender many of these homes end up in foreclosure which hurts everybody including the community where the home is located

2092309 heating the air increases its volume and by increasing its volume it increases the cars range thats why with one gallon of gasoline or its equivalent we are able to make over 100 mpg

2092365 all too often claims that meat is linked to cancer are made as if they are proven fact but todays panel presented compelling evidence the conventional wisdom is not always current or accurate
2092366 if someone today said the world was flat wed laugh because thats such an uninformed and disproved hypothesis
2092367 we need to put some of our notions about meat and cancer nitrite risks and other issues into that same mythological category the public has been saturated for so long with these claims that theyve been incorporated into our belief systems but just as the world isnt flat meat cured with sodium nitrite is both safe and nutritious
2092368 to a very large extent it is in their interest to try to reach a negotiated settlement that is a doable deal
2092369 trying to exhaust every avenue they can to avoid the kind of financial outlay we are talking about here
2092370 i would expect that the damage model that we create showing what is actually happened in the watershed will be beyond the reach of the companies
2092371 its going to be far more significant than the resources that are available even though its a multi billion dollar industry
2092372 does not deter us from the overriding objective of having a business operate in an environmentally sound manner
2092373 its only when they have exhausted what they reasonably think are methods of avoiding a day of reckoning that they will get realistic about resolving the issue

2092386 huge sea level rises are coming unless we act now
2092387 the current rate of sea level change is not without consequences however the primary issue is whether global warming will reach a level such that ice sheets begin to disintegrate in a rapid non linear fashion on west antarctica greenland or both once well under way such a collapse might be impossible to stop because there are multiple positive feedbacks in that event a sea level rise of several metres at least would be expected as an example let us say that ice sheet melting adds 1 centimetre to sea level for the decade 2005 to 2015 and that this doubles each decade until the west antarctic ice sheet is largely depleted this would yield a rise in sea level of more than 5 metres by 2095 of course i cannot prove that my choice of a 10 year doubling time is accurate but id bet 1000 to a doughnut that it provides a far better estimate of the ice sheets contribution to sea level rise than a linear response in my opinion if the world warms by 2 c to 3 c such massive sea level rise is inevitable and a substantial fraction of the rise would occur within a century business as usual global warming would almost surely send the planet beyond a tipping point guaranteeing a disastrous degree of sea level rise

2092687 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2092688 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2092689 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2092690 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

2092713 provide by means of its own choosing review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence of medellin and the others
2092714 n ot all international law obligations automatically constitute binding federal law enforceable in the united state courts
2092715 the judgments of an international tribunal a higher status than that enjoyed by many of our most fundamental constitutional protections
2092716 the united states constitution vests sovereignty in the congress the u s supreme court the president the 50 states and ultimately in we the people
2092717 had medellin prevailed american sovereignty and independence would have been gravely undermined
2092718 why not the analysis of a question similar to the one we confront contained in an opinion of the supreme court of canada the constitutional court of south africa the german constitutional court or the european court of human rights
2092719 we see all the time how the world really its trite but its true is growing together the challenge will be whether our constitution fits into the governing documents of other nations
2092720 we have many reconstruction projects and as you know most of the infrastructure of the country had collapsed after the war and that needs a lot of money to rebuild the country
2092721 if you look carefully i do not think that the u s budget is spending on the iraqi economy
2092722 u s money is not being spent at the moment on reconstructing iraq but its spent on services for the u s military its a mutual interest for both countries
2092723 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
2092724 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people

2092771 the ability to store and process this much data at this pace would have been impossible 40 years ago
2092772 you can actually see stress strain and deflection on the computer screen so its not like the old days where you had to look up at the dial gauge read the load look up again and read the strain not only could you make an error but you did not actually know what the reading was telling you
2092773 the intensity and scrutiny of this testing is unprecedented the redundancy is there to eliminate any concerns
2092774 the only way we can do that is to have more personnel and equipment
2092775 we can process 2 000 ft of cores per week and classify according to astm standards for moisture and organic content which is a big concern for borrow source material
2092776 this is a major data collection that feeds the engineers

2092788 es rid culo que s lo dos meses despu s de la votaci n del parlamento europeo de la vega ante un auditorio extranjero garantice que en espa a no se va a aplicar esta directiva a su regreso a espa a la vicepresidenta tendr que dar muchas explicaciones y esta insumisi n europea es otra m s para a adir a la larga lista

2092794 i really responded to the exaggerated shapes of the girls panniers the brocade fabrics and the lavish trim details that you would only see on royalty
2092795 the real challenge for me was taking the shapes i was responding to in my research and applying them to paper in a contemporary way
2092796 this book contained everything i love drawing construction and the look of fashion
2092797 the gallery staff supported the dress with found objects in the room like the chest of drawers and the mirrors
2092798 one of my favorite details is the vintage shoes that are lazily tossed by the dresser as if she had just come home from a fantastic soiree and kicked off her heels
2092799 the floral print was adapted from a bavarian wallpaper from the 1750s that i found
2092800 i wanted these details to add whimsy to the piece because the wallpaper is fairly serious so i wanted the materials to be accessible
2092801 im one of those artists who likes to do lots of things
2092802 and i have a bunch of projects in my head for things like childrens books stationery and more sculpture
2092803 but i think my work crosses a couple genres and i am very inspired by fashion the grandiosity of fashion really stimulates me but so does the concept of dress as expression
2092804 top 10 tips to reduce the impact of your office equipment on the environment
2092805 the increased acceptance of greener vehicles such as hybrid and electric vehicles is to be encouraged they have an important role in improving fuel economy and reducing emissions our advanced external sound synthesis technology increases pedestrian safety while retaining the cars environmental benefits we hope that legislators introduce minimum noise requirements for vehicles to encourage the adoption of technologies such as ours which will ultimately increase pedestrian safety
2092806 blind and partially sighted people use the noise of oncoming traffic as a cue for when it is safe to cross a road if a quiet hybrid electric vehicle is approaching then they will no longer have this cue and are immediately put at risk
2092807 as the leading voice on transport and mobility issues in the visual impairment sector guide dogs believes further research and development is needed to address the issues of identifying quiet vehicles for blind and partially sighted people the charity recognises the environmental benefits of these vehicles however more consideration needs to be given to the safety implications to visually impaired pedestrians
2092808 road safety professionals teach children that they can improve their safety by listening for traffic and the sound of an approaching vehicle is a warning that most pedestrians will use before making the decision to cross the road new electric engines make vehicles much quieter so we need to look at ways of ensuring the safety of pedestrians we welcome innovative solutions which address this

2092869 apple needs to do a lot of work to improve communications between developers and the people in charge of the app store
2092870 in my experience communication has been pretty spotty so far as opposed to the great service apples provided with developer technical support we have questions that have gone unanswered so far and unlike dts we dont even have any kind of direct contact with anyone there unfortunately
2092871 netshare did not violate any of the developer or app store agreements
2092872 automated e mail systems being employed on both ends which resulted in e mails being lost in transit
2092873 its like the app store division is this top secret untouchable branch of apple
2092874 apple pulled the app july 31 without giving my any notification that they were doing it or what their justification was for removing it
2092875 ive tried to contact them about the issue but its been a complete dead end
2092876 clear consistent communication and a application standard policy that is clear and applied universally to all developers
2092877 communication is the key here both between apple and devs and also among devs themselves
2092878 the iphone sdk nda has been completely hindering progress and it needs to be lifted asap
2092879 if apple wants to keep things in upcoming versions of the sdk under wraps then it should be possible to modify the nda so that were all able to communicate about things that are in the final shipping version of the iphone os and sdk once this happens iphone development in general will improve because well be able to discuss issues openly and share code publicly the iphone platform as a whole will undoubtably improve as a result

2092899 working for the olympic call center has been a real life experience weve had the opportunity to take part in an international effort that has definitely widened our horizons its hard to realize how excited the chinese are about the olympics until youre in the center of all the action china has really united while preparing for the games
2092900 ive had a great time met some great people and had some great experiences the international atmosphere along with the work experience has given me great tools for my future endeavors

2092966 i had a solid training camp i couldnt ask for anything more except a victory
2092967 i think its something i had to do in general i dont know any different i didnt want any hand me outs or anything like that
2092968 if i was going to do this im going to do this full blown ive been an athlete my whole life he has more fights than i do and more experience i guess in the fight game but this camp i really surrounded myself with many different people i brought travis wiuff into this camp i brought in brad imes just different guys to challenge me in different areas it was a good camp
2092969 just be patient i have 15 minutes to win this fight i just got to be smart i showed a little immaturity on my behalf by making a wrong move if brock lesnar were to fight the brock lesnar then id beat him i just try to learn and grow and evolve my game every game im just eager to learn and evolve and i have to if i want to be a contender in the heavyweight division ive always had the mindset that i dont know everything you learn something new every day thats the honest to god truth
2092970 heath has had a long career i dont know if hes at the end of his career or not were prepared for whatever heath herring shows up that night therere many different heaths and were prepared for all of them and i believe it
2092971 the hardest part of training for heath was is that hes unpredictable
2092972 you dont know what hes going to bring that evening our main goal in this fight is just to suffocate him and control him theres no surprises for me im full boar im going to stay close to him and avoid his kicks and his solid right hand i believe on the ground were going to control him
2092973 for me i dont have to get on a damn airplane im going to sleep in my own bed i think home field advantage plays a big part but you know heath is going to try to come here and take that away from me but im going to do everything in my power to make sure that doesnt happen
2092974 for me ive lost my debut fight and like i said im a sore loser i dont want to lose its going to be gangbusters on aug 9 to win look at anybody you dont see anybody hanging around in the ufc with a losing record

2092997 this is nobodys fault in particular because of past practice where governments did fund it but the fact remains that the university cannot give salary increases without financial provision for it
2092998 the vice chancellor and senior management group volunteer for a five per cent salary cut on top of this reduction that has already been made i appeal to our academic and comparable staff those who benefited from the salary increases in 2005 and 2007 to agree to a five percent cut to salaries from january 1 2009
2092999 this means finding 5 7million over 2008 we will need 11 9million over 2008 figures or an additional 6 2million over 2009 figures

2093001 people take a little extra effort when they know they play against you when they hit you they hit you a little harder and even make comments about how they hit the heisman trophy winner hell get quite a bit of that id imagine

2093003 youre definitely under the microscope people are looking for negative things to bring you down
2093004 woody hayes always said youre either getting better or getting worse

2093038 these are the first gdp figures to come out and they anticipate a general setback in europe
2093039 even if italy is suffering from a more unfavourable situation than germany or france we have every chance of seeing a contraction of about 0 3 percent or more in the whole of the eurozone
2093040 even the german gdp expected next week is likely to show a fall of 0 8 percent
2093041 indicate a continued weakening outlook for all the major seven economies
2093042 the latest data for non oecd member economies tentatively point to expansion in china and brazil and a downturn in india and russia
2093043 this slowdown can be explained mainly by a contraction of internal demand with consumption depressed and a fall of exports weighed down by an unduly strong euro
2093044 these factors can only contribute to a serious slowing in the eurozone as the president of the european central bank jean claude trichet recognised on thursday when speaking of very weak growth in coming quarters

2093067 is that our site offers fashion items that are now popular in japan at japanese prices many other sites charge 1 5 to 2 times as much and dont always offer up to date items

2093513 after spending several months in dharamsala teaching children with special needs i realized the lack of formal education available to this population not only in dharamsala but throughout india and the developing world

2093543 reports that the council is in some way threatening these iconic heritage trees is a runaway train with no engineer
2093544 the entire basis for the concern was rendered from a scoping report about the need for stormwater work to protect the cottages
2093545 such risks are flagged in order that they can be eliminated
2093546 its about protecting the trees not revving up the chainsaws
2093547 media commentary to date that the council was in some way suggesting that the trees be removed was completely without foundation
2093548 it was disappointing that arrowtown residents had jumped the gun without knowing the facts
2093549 the irony is that the council is actually at the start of a process to afford the trees and the miners cottages which the council bought to ensure their survival better protection and ultimately enhanced longevity
2093550 it has always been our intention to work with the arrowtown community with advice from a professional aborist to find a solution that satisfies all parties and that ensures a long and healthy future for our heritage trees and cottages
2093551 amy has always been nifty with the advice although she often gets herself into pickles she is very honest very caring and very perceptive when it comes to dealing with other peoples problem

2093570 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness

2093572 has been marred by a well documented surge in violations of the rights of free expression and association as well as media freedom in addition abuses of migrant construction workers who were pivotal to beijings infrastructure improvements have increased as have evictions of beijing residents whose homes were demolished to make way for that infrastructure
2093573 crackdown on human rights defenders journalists and lawyers has intensified because beijing is hosting the olympics the authorities have stepped up repression of dissident voices in their efforts to present an image of stability and harmony to the outside world
2093574 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
2093575 we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs

2093595 apenas lo conoc se me fue el dolor de cabeza
2093596 dios me dijo que era hora de ser su esposa alabado sea dios hoy soy su esposa
2093597 yo dije que no pod a casarme con un hombre m s viejo pero me dijo que era una orden directa de dios
2093598 ahora soy la mujer m s feliz de la tierra cuando uno se casa con un hombre que tiene 86 esposas sabe que el sabe como cuidarlas
2093599 cuando te sientas aqu si tienes una enfermedad yo puedo verla y eliminarla

2093601 i cant deny that im a nerd i am who i am im pretty normal im not a smooth type of girl i run into things i trip i spill food i say stupid things i really dont have it all together but im working on it i really am
2093602 in the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains in the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders dry and white in the sun and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees the trunks of the trees too were dusty and the leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops marching along the road and the dust rising and leaves stirred by the breeze falling and the soldiers marching and afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves
2093603 it was very late and everyone had left the cafe except an old man who sat in the shadow the leaves of the tree made against the electric light in the day time the street was dusty but at night the dew settled the dust and the old man liked to sit late because he was deaf and now at night it was quiet and he felt the difference the two waiters inside the cafe knew that the old man was a little drunk and while he was a good client they knew that if he became too drunk he would leave without paying so they kept watch on him
2093604 they sat together at a table that was close against the wall near the door of the cafe and looked at the terrace where the tables were all empty except where the old man sat in the shadow of the leaves of the tree that moved slightly in the wind a girl and a soldier went by in the street the street light shone on the brass number on his collar the girl wore no head covering and hurried beside him
2093605 life is very short and ugly women are very long and sitting there at the table i decided that even though i was a writer and supposed to have an insatiable curiosity about all sorts of people i did not really care to know whether these two were married or what they saw in each other or what their politics were or whether he had a little money or she had a little money or anything about them i decided they must be in the radio
2093606 when the phone rang parker was in the garage killing a man
2093607 other diseases came on strong this year but scabies was up to the challenge
2093608 we also want to give an honorable mention to irritable bowel syndrome dont worry your time is coming
2093609 but these diseases have to ride on more than just past accomplishments to break back into the mainstream
2093610 naturally were disappointed but we had quite the uphill battle
2093611 were constantly fighting public service announcements warning people about too much sun but nobodys out there telling everyone how bad scabies is
2093612 and well continue to support melanoma as the only natural cancer
2093613 dont look back and dont run you must never run from anything immortal it attracts their attention
2093614 die verwaltung tausender prozessorkerne und unterschiedlicher prozessortypen ist eine herausforderung der wir uns jeden tag stellen und sie wird k nftig nur wachsen

2093616 when the new salary law irritated international monetary fund because of a large amount of funds especially the financial variations for each employee which amounted sometimes to one million for each and the whole fund estimated billions thus the legal department in the ministry were instructed to stop the increase from the first of september and to disburse all differences of the last four months on next year
2093617 the imf has adopted now the issue of iraqs debt which emphasized that iraq must repay its debts instead call for other nations to cancel their debt agreements we are connected with them long this convention until next year to become free to act then iraqs oil resources will go to dfi fund and there is a committee of consultant supporting the disbursement
2093618 starting salaries do not tell you a whole lot but there is a real divergence in dollar terms as you go over the course of a career
2093619 we are obviously pleased but certainly not surprised to see that our former students fare so well in the marketplace
2093620 its certainly gratifying to see that employers recognize the value of a texas a amp m degree and the contributions our graduates bring to their firms
2093621 ethics and the business of journalism a discussion of urgent importance
2093622 not only is there a place for ethics but really it will be ethical behavior that will allow us to differentiate ourselves in a world in which there is such a rich feast and cacophony
2093623 but im far from disparaging todays business decisions we need to be teaching entrepreneurialism in journalism school the old business model is broken high quality advertisers dont want it if we cant figure out how to pay for the creation of content then we have a problem
2093624 i think we in journalism tend to think our ethics have been all purpose and spotless which they have not
2093625 journalism is changing so quickly and old ethics standards dont always apply
2093626 lessons from the past and fodder for the future forty years after kerner and lionel lee c barrows vision of an inclusive aejmc
2093627 lee barrow may have just gotten a foot in the door for african americans but he left the door open for all other races
2093628 i think what the panelists have pointed out is that although were not where we used to be we aint where we oughta or want to be and theres a lot of work left to be done
2093629 40 years after the kerner report there is no method of holding broadcasters accountable
2093630 forty years after we are right where we started at the starting line
2093631 the gaps are greater and the needs for leadership are greater than during that time
2093632 advocacy journalism or public relations re defining the values of news
2093633 good journalism is intrinsically advocacy in the sense that it hopes for reactions
2093634 why do journalism otherwise do you want people to read and watch something and not react i think one of the roles of journalism is to stimulate a reaction amongst moral people youre advocating thinking its not so much youre saying you should take one side or another but advocating that they should consider the subject
2093635 truth comes in packaging news broadcasts and newspaper articles truthfully saying for example now here is bill moyers with his commentary for the night to draw a distinction
2093636 kandiliste vormidega on lihtsam seal on pindalaks pool k lgede korrutisest
2093637 dat kan ik nu doen want het blijkt dat ik afval va
2093638 lo que vamos a hacer es que vamos a tratar de sustituir aquellos medicamentos de los laboratorios que no ofrecieron descuentos
2093639 siempre seremos muy cuidadosos de no poner en riesgo el tratamiento de las personas con vih
2093640 los medicamentos que tienen no pueden pasar las pruebas de la equivalencia
2093641 pero si viene una gente de la india a ofrecernos antirretrovirales a buen costo pues se har la revisi n de su planta y si cumple con las buenas pr cticas de fabricaci n pues tendremos otra opci n para tener medicamentos m s baratos
2093642 puso en riesgo la seguridad sanitaria del pa s y al borde de la extinci n la industria farmac utica nacional
2093643 la criminalizaci n aumenta el estigma ninguna otra enfermedad se ve con tanto temor y repugnancia como el vih y las leyes no ayudan a prevenir ni al tratamiento de la enfermedad sino por el contrario a echarle le a al fuego
2093644 the dollar is in my view in a genuine recovery this trend could run much further than many think
2093645 this is a major reassessment in a very short period of time the sentiment turned 180 degrees
2093646 the market now believes that the us economy once again will be able to leave a crisis behind very quickly thats why we see the dollar rising like a phoenix
2093647 the record industry is realizing the internet as a proven way to promote or sell contents
2093648 the application which consists of four interfaces white label aggregator bespoke and jukebox connects artists and content owners and their listeners via the internet
2093649 they the ffa want to eyeball us and make sure that were fair dinkum
2093650 that will be a preliminary meeting and we then expect to make our presentation to them some time before august 27
2093651 we have a five year business plan and will be putting that to a number of potential investors on tuesday and then the ffa
2093652 a lot of hard work is going into this and the support is there not just in canberra but beyond as well
2093653 having those 5 000 members on board can help us convince them we are serious here which we certainly are
2093654 i think the fact that canberra has had a team accepted into the w league should send a very clear signal there is the support here for this game no question
2093655 and again i come back to the fact that we have the capital of new zealand represented in the a league but not the capital of australia
2093656 if you have the finances and and you have the community support then whats the problem
2093657 god weeps when he sees us put the blinders on like horses with spirits broken he weeps because he never intended for us to live lives of solemn resignation
2093658 i have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation whether well fed or hungry whether living in plenty or in want
2093659 let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need
2093660 sorrowful yet always rejoicing poor yet making many rich having nothing and yet possessing everything
2093661 i have learned to be content whatever the circumstances i know what it is to be in need and i know what it is to have plenty
2093662 in him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
2093663 you will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart
2093664 i have learned the secret of being content i can do everything through him who gives me strength
2093665 i have strength for all things in christ who empowers me i am ready for anything and equal to anything through him who infuses inner strength into me that is i am selfsufficient in christs sufficiency
2093666 i tried to obtain him on loan last season and am absolutely delighted to eventually get him to tannadice
2093667 ils r pondent toutes les demandes et sont patients quand les choses ne se passent pas comme pr vu avant le match aller javais soulign que ce ne serait rien dextraordinaire si on battait anderlecht nous avons beaucoup dexp rience nos joueurs sont suffisamment bons et il ne faut pas d nigrer leurs capacit s nous ne sommes pas surpris
2093668 anderlecht a bien jou et nous a pos beaucoup de probl mes surtout en seconde p riode quand ils navaient plus rien perdre
2093669 mais jai eu limpression quanderlecht nous a sous estim s depuis le d but pour eux cest un d shonneur de perdre face une quipe b larusse ils taient plus motiv s pour le retour mais on tait plus forts maintenant nous avons autant de chances que levski
2093670 ce nest pas une simple surprise cest une v ritable catastrophe
2093671 a fait sept ans que je joue pour anderlecht et je ne me rappelle pas quon ait d j t limin s aussi t t mais quon peut y faire nos adversaires taient plus forts nous sommes les fautifs cest peut tre parce que la saison na pas encore commenc en belgique mais bate a bien jou aux deux matches
2093672 nous nous sommes compliqu la t che nous leur avons fait des cadeaux domicile et avec les deux cartons rouges si jattends que des joueurs quittent le club quand on est limin il faut aussi regarder laspect financier il faut se pencher sur les moyens de compenser la perte financi re par exemple en faisant des transferts
2093673 jam s hab a visto una eliminaci n por estar desganado
2093674 as como esto nunca le hab a pasado nada al caballo
2093675 lo presentamos otra vez pero antes de hacerlo trotar me informaron que era su deber preservar la salud de los caballos que ste es un deporte que todo el mundo est mirando y que no pod an hacer competir un caballo que se viera deca do que lo lamentaban por m por nuestro pa s pero quedaba oficialmente fuera de los juegos ol mpicos

2093677 seguramente no se aclimat bien a las condiciones atmosf rica de aqu de hong kong pero seg n mi opini n podr a haber participado igual pero parece que mi opini n no vale mucho en este caso

2093681 at first i bawled for a month straight i was so sad i just went into this weird funk and i dyed my hair black when we were dating nick wanted me to get highlights and so i did that and i got myself looking great and then on the day we broke up i was like i want to make my hair black now i dont want to look pretty i want to look hard core i was rebelling against everything nick wanted me to be and then i was like ive got to be by myself for now and just figure out who i really am

2093684 he is a very good hearted guy and hes very passionate about what he does
2093685 another problem is that the carbon economy of glucose fermentation is poor
2093686 for every 10 g of ethanol produced you also release 9 6 g co2
2093687 our method appears to be the most efficient conversion of cellulose into simple hydrophobic organic compounds described to date
2093688 it also surpasses the carbon yields of glucose and sucrose fermentation
2093689 were not saying one word about last season its august 2008
2093690 if israel went to war with ireland who would you fight for

2093692 i took gothams white knight and brought him down to our level it wasnt hard ysee madness as you know is like gravity all it takes is a little push

2093695 chance is the only reality in this cruel world unprejudiced unbiased fair
2093696 i had never really split up with sarah it only lasted for one day or so and everyone made such a big deal of it its all such a joke

2093722 mercedes amg represents high performance and exclusivity the same is true of bang amp olufsens in car sound systems jointly we are therefore able to meet mercedes amg customers expectations to sound systems
2093723 the agreement enables bang amp olufsen to further utilize the expertise and processes we have built up in order to meet the requirements of the automotive industry and of course mercedes amg is also an interesting partner for bang amp olufsen because the cars are sold across the world

2093726 there was no way of even finding all the current checklist projects without days of googling
2093727 as a result much of the great work thats going into developing community standards was being overlooked and different communities were at risk of developing mutually incompatible standards mibbi will help to prevent them from reinventing the wheel
2093728 communities working together through mibbi will produce non overlapping minimal information modules
2093729 the idea is that each checklist will fit neatly into a jigsaw with each community being able to take the pieces that are relevant to them
2093730 mibbi represents the first new effort taking the open biomedical ontologies obo as its role model
2093731 the mibbi portal operates in a manner analogous to obo as an open information resource while the mibbi foundry fosters collaborative development and integration of checklists into self contained modules just like the obo foundry does for the ontologies
2093732 we became alarmed a couple of days ago when we saw he wasnt sweating like he should

2093742 the use of the me domain extension has seen individuals embrace its verb oriented potential by registering catchy domain names like fly me and insure me personalised domains such as joebloggs me and unconventional domain names that combine domain extensions to make a full word or a kind of pun such as aweso me
2093743 i thought it would be a little tougher than that
2093744 praters the real deal it just worked out that i caught him with the first shot that i threw and i followed up with many more
2093745 that was my goal to go out there and do it quick and make everyone open their eyes again and let them know that im back and that the last two fights were kind of flukes
2093746 im ready for it so its just a matter of getting condit to agree but the wec definitely wants it to happen
2093747 its up to condits camp to figure out what it wants
2093748 id like to fight as often as possible but the way its looking this is the fight i want to wait for
2093749 i dont want to risk anything like i did before fighting condit the first time
2093750 i was supposed to fight him when i fought kevin knabjan two months before and i think i peaked too early for that its hard to peak twice in two months so if it comes out that way thats the way im going to have to take it
2093751 my confidence level is as high as it can be
2093752 ive always been really confident in my ground game but now with my hands ive been doing a lot of sparring and im confident everywhere now

2093756 using simple mechanics principles the researchers have produced for the first time electronic devices on a hemispherical surface so that they can take images much like those captured by the human eye
2093757 this strategy opens up exciting new engineering design possibilities by eliminating the two dimensional planar constraints of conventional semiconductor wafer based optoelectronics
2093758 mechanics helps to reduce the stresses and strain in components and guide and optimize the system design
2093759 i am girl who is in 3rd year of polytechnic studies i have a part time job that earns me good money so as you have read i am super busy the thing is my bf thinks that i am not committed to the r s because i dont spend enough time with him i go out with him on most sundays sometimes go out with friends for the rest of the week i am busy with either school or work hes very possesive any time of the day he would call me for no apparent reason and when he sees a guy talk to me he would be very aggressive in the way he talks to that guy wth hes also studying but not working so when we go out i want to eat in a more expensive restaurant can afford he would drag me to the nearest coffee shop to eat i dont mind paying for his meal he could treat me for the movie or something is sg that hot every where he goes he wears t shirt shorts and sandals nothing else even when meeting my parents i am a person with big dreams and when i share my thoughts on how to persue these dreams we have been dating for 2 years btw last night he called and said that our r s has strained i thought everything was fine he said that i should focus more on him how what should i do is it really my fault that he feels that way

2093774 they were a little slow to perceive the magnitude of the risk
2093775 the lack of these liquidity facilities in the early stages of the financial crisis forced them to rely much more heavily on monetary policy
2093776 had the fed moved more quickly it could have been a stitch in time that saved
2093777 what we should not have is the central bank involved in its balance sheet
2093778 if you allow major fluctuations in the monetary base as a result of other than monetary policy reasons i think youre taking undue risks with the notion of the stability of the financial system and very specifically the feds control of inflation
2093779 under the circumstances theyve done about as well as you could expect

2093793 kentuckians like all americans are hard hit by record high gas prices
2093794 these tough times call for creative solutions and i believe allowing kentuckians the option of using an electric vehicle is one of those solutions electric vehicles may help ease the burden on the pocketbooks of hard working kentucky families as well as reduce their carbon footprint
2093795 never have we received such hospitality and such overwhelming enthusiasm for electric vehicles as exhibited by the governor and every single person we met while in kentucky
2093796 seeing such a swift reaction by the kentucky government in favor of zap affirms our belief that the time is now for electric transportation to play a greater role in society we all want to build better transportation and it doesnt matter if you live in kentucky or california the dream is everywhere

2093850 this slowdown can be explained mainly by a contraction of internal demand with consumption depressed and a fall of exports weighed down by an unduly strong euro
2093851 these factors can only contribute to a serious slowing in the eurozone as the president of the european central bank jean claude trichet recognised on thursday when speaking of very weak growth in coming quarters
2093852 these are the first gdp figures to come out and they anticipate a general setback in europe
2093853 even if italy is suffering from a more unfavourable situation than germany or france we have every chance of seeing a contraction of about 0 3 percent or more in the whole of the eurozone
2093854 even the german gdp expected next week is likely to show a fall of 0 8 percent

2093879 well the idea was born on my commute to work with good friend dice tsutsumi he started work at pixar last summer weve been friends for years since when we were working at blue sky studios on ice age we hit it off immediately at the time in big part due to our passion for miyazaki and ghibli
2093880 so here we are driving into work and dice mentions he read in the news that the foundation miyazaki started a few years ago to protect sayama forest the place where he got the idea for totoro was still struggling to protect this land from development mostly due to the ever raising real estate costs so we started talking about how we totally could lend a hand to such a cause seemed only fair really do it as a big heartfelt thank you to miya san himself for the years and years of inspiration he gave us dice also knew that last year i had done an art auction benefit to raise funds for emergency a wonderful non profit that builds hospitals in warthorn countries so we though why not do something like that gather all the amazingly talented artists we know from all around the world have them donate a piece inspired by totoro and make an art auction event out of it seemed like a plan
2093881 we enrolled the help of good friend ronnie del carmen and yukino pang from the asian art museum here in san francisco with the four of us forming the core committee
2093882 well one of the key factors was getting ghiblis permission and blessing thanks to dice we were able to do that he went back to tokyo where he grew up and had a few meetings with several people from ghibli and the totoro forest foundation theyve been supportive since they think this effort could really help the foundation not only in a monetary sense but even in helping raising awareness we talked to the heads of pixar a few months later and theyve been totally excited about this project theyve given us the ok to host the event here at the studio and their support has been huge from that day on
2093883 well the event is turning out to be a pretty huge endeavor at every turn the project has gotten bigger in scope and reach theres many facets to it the book the auction and the exhibition dice and yukino have been the driving forces behind most of this effort and i am very grateful for their hard work as far as the auction goes we are extremely excited about it and we are working hard to make it a very very special evening weve just this weekend seen the whole collection of more than two hundred pieces all together in one room and its just breathtaking we really hope people will be flying in for this one laughing
2093884 what else can i say well i think this is a great cause its a wonderful little urban forest we are trying to help save and its more than that its a big thank you for the dreams and wonders miyazaki has given us through the years its also a communal symbolic gesture different artists from different parts of the world coming together for a good cause i love that
2093885 the lido is a very beautiful place im glad that i can walk there again
2093886 for these last few year we have not done so i ordered to stop it
2093887 every year we used to accept four to five newbie sakuga staff members however they were soon swallowed in the elder group and brought nothing new to the studio they did not behave as freshmen at all there did not blow any fresh wind from them so i quit recruiting these days the japanese anime industry outsource their work to foreign countries like china or the philippines so the relation of labor supply and demand is not so tight as it used be we can outsource douga easily these days
2093888 you mean the gross amount of anime work is decreasing
2093889 yes at least in japan for example the douga of a short program for a tv series can be finished in one or two days by outsourcing it to china moreover they add color on it let alone its quality they all spill from over the tv screens some say the head note of the anime industry still remains in japan i do not agree with it the head might be like a sponge
2093890 basically they note meaning regularly recruited animators are not curious and do not have interest in other persons they do not want to give influence to others or get influence from others they usually work with wearing earplugs note meaning an ipod i do not know what they are listening though i think they consist of a group of shit guys have i said too much laughing anyway our staff might have realized that good movies cannot be made by elder staff members only so we changed our policy and are planning to recruit young animators
2093891 about 20 at once if we take little by little they will surly be swallowed by that group soon basically the value of setting up a studio is keeping its torso if we need the head or hands then we can bring ones from outside so the torso is necessarily needed to set the head face or hands on it the torso is not needed to be so clever or like a rapier but it must be a group of faithful and patient people it is needed to have a strong stomach guts and anus however it is not easy to maintain
2093892 so do you mean you will build the torso by using newcomers
2093893 thats right our torso has gotten deteriorated now laughing once we had recruited many animators and taught them everything they have grown up and some became sakuga directors or genga staff we have already got our return on investment
2093894 did you get more in return than seeding money laughing
2093895 right rather i grated them like radish again and squeezed them out again laughing making animation needs sucking the lifeblood from young talents like a vampire
2093896 however i am not able to suck the blood anymore the torso has thinned down to skin and bone all i can suck is just water but no blood so we need to freshen the torso if we can build it again then good a head or hands might sprout from it i do not want those newcomers to be influenced by tattered elders and i want them to have a steady and quiet life so the training institute should be placed in a local city
2093897 i must tell them you will need to spend one year and a half as an ascetic monk you do not need to see anything any information or news get up early and come to the institute at 9 and work hard till 5 during that time you must not use a cell phone e mail or ipod devote yourself in looking at the world and drawing pictures then we will ensure your salary and life you can learn everything you need even if it is in a rural city if you bear with this one year and a half you will get much more than spending ten years slobbing around in tokyo
2093898 do you intend on recruiting people that have some experience
2093899 no well be looking for quite newbies i will go and teach them how to draw one day once a week if they can complete a short movie and see children having fun at the museum they will get a big confidence
2093900 we might be able to find big talent in them
2093901 anyway if we continue our style any longer hand drawn animation might perish there is one way that we also join the consumers who consume everything and entertainment many of our staffs already joined them
2093902 no we do not need to be consumers they must not watch korean dramas or purchase the dvds laughing i do not mean all of our staff should be the way i wish them to be however at least the core of the creators that assume a responsibility to take the studio to our goal must be stoic a group that has the common experience of spending a hard time together is what we need during their training if they learned hard and can find the secret of the world of animation even if it as small as the eye of a needle they will be able to go on as animators
2093903 if i would tell about all of the events that happen during the time process in which the story takes place then it must take many hours what should i do i decided to take the risk of using drastic skips there is a theory of how to build up a story like first someone meets somebody else the story develops a small catastasis comes in the middle a big catastasis comes at the end and then a happy ending closes the story it is very common in samurai plays westerns and detectives if a director repeats that particular pattern then his movies begin to decay i know there are such guys repeating that style over and over again and without any doubt however we should notice its corrupted smell by ourselves if i start making a movie with a foreseeable story development then it soon begins to emit a corrupted smell to me laughing in that case i should throw it away working any longer on it will only degenerate things i believe so
2093904 that storm was caused by ponyo she just wanted to meet sosuke again so she did not have any bad intentions we cannot blame her that is the kind of character i wanted to make as a heroine
2093905 after i made hauru no ugoku shiro howls moving castle i regretted that people said it was not understandable basically my belief was to make movies for children despite of this i made howls i had worried till i decided to make a next movie
2093906 i intended to make a film that 5 year old children can understand they dont watch it by logic but by feeling however it wasnt easy
2093907 well i dont put the emphasize on the interface of water and air when children dive into the water and open their eyes of course they cant breath but they will see a quite different world it is really exciting i hope my film can help them trying to get such a small adventure
2093908 talking from our experience people tend not to be so surprised at things that have been done
2093909 i want to move whole of the world basically we became animators because we wanted to move everything so it isnt good if only the characters move even on buildings it is ok if not only curtains but also the building itself can move not only the grasses but even the ground can move such fluctuation gives the movie a sense of being alive
2093910 i think we should respect the sea including the hills and trees around it all of it has not been lost though we often lose to the power of money however i believe it still remains deep in our japanese mind that has lived in this island country for a long time
2093911 when they go to the sea they might think the waves are alive thats the clue so that they become to care about nature of course they never think waves have eyes and chase children they might think nature is alive in fact small children usually do so im afraid their precious time is spoiled thats all
2093912 a movie that is able to get through by watching the pictures only without the dialogue i want to try and make a future length film that tells its story by the animation itself
2093913 its too vexatiously complicated make it more simple when you come at the point where you understand it that is the moment you must quit
2093914 want hands wants legs itll be nice if i had them
2093915 nice try though if i make it i draw the sunken town under the water surface on that flamingos are dancing
2093916 in fact he has some they just dont appear because im too busy to draw them
2093917 because of the worlds balance disruption the moon is getting close to earth
2093918 listening to this music i can feel the adrenaline flowing
2093919 i became at such an age that i can count the rest of my days until
2093920 i want to dance again for a while until omukae comes to me
2093921 you should act cool as usual i am sorry to say but soon both picture and sound will get confused youll soon get it on screen
2093922 there has suddenly occurred a small but strong typhoon and it is coming up with 30 km h and remaining its power please pay attention to the weather forecast and keep being aware of it
2093923 we considered that we should add some more scenes that you act but unfortunately we couldnt
2093924 this was the most exhausted news reading that ive ever experienced
2093925 those guys on screen never eat a meal they only live on liquor and tobacco no they didnt ingest them but just pretended to be ingesting them and about sex they just pretended to be having sex there wasnt any smell of sweat or sperm they rode on airplanes and motorbikes however all of them seemed like unsubstantial machines on the monitor display even those machines seemed to pretend being machines
2093926 this is oshiis first film during which i didnt fall asleep halfway
2093927 it shows oshiis love for anime and miyazaki and i was titillated with my heart
2093928 im just back from watching the preview straightly it was very interesting kids can easily enjoy it as usual in miyazaki anime it also has a message i like the pictures of m rchen like standard and its colors both of them show the importance and the pleasure of figment i cannot write any more because it isnt long before its release
2093929 it has all cleared up today this summer you should watch ponyo at the largest theatre possible near you forget reading any magazines tv programs or tv cm that comment or advertise it as much as you can you must go to the theatre pay the fee and sit on that seat without any prejudice or knowledge as far as i am concerned i eagerly desire to watch it again
2093930 one day miyazaki invited me to his room he usually closes the door when he intends to tell something important most of the time it is not so important though laughing he told me he wanted to build a company nursery for the children the ghibli employees got he was planning to make a movie about nursery around that time i asked him what the nursery movie plan would look like he told me the real nursery would be first and his movie plan would be quit after that he changed his new movie plans and began working on ponyo so i think nayo was the trigger of ponyo
2093931 oh thats mr suzuki i just touched him with my shoulder oh there is his majesty takahata
2093932 the world we draw is not the one seen through a lens but the one seen by naked eyes the world seen by naked eyes shows the curious things in large but ignores the things we dont care for that is the way it goes when cutting out and drawing a scenery like that the result is a world that we used to see somewhere sometime if you ask if my layouts fit to the perspective an architect draws they never do if we draw perspective lines before we begin making a layout then the pictures will surely become dull
2093933 why must we make one episode in a single week
2093934 i devoted 15 years of my youth under paku san note takahata i wish he will give it back to me some day
2093935 a girl of about the same age as sosuke is chasing us
2093936 his movie doesnt solely come from his imagination but from his real life as well
2093937 we believe we have been able to catch miyazakis real face and life while struggling to make this movie watch the vibration of miyazakis mind never compromising his heart when making a film
2093938 when ghibli was making chihiro miyazaki and i visited korea to outsource the douga after finishing the business we walked around the backstreets of seoul and found a block that showed much resemblance with the town the ogino family wander into it was really a d j vu for us and we were much surprised maybe many asian cities have a kind of bawdy and nostalgic taste like that
2093939 things never goes as drawing like im much more familiar than you in architecture
2093940 i love sprited away so much and watched it over and over again thats why im very happy and feel like im dreaming in the past ive acted on radio dramas or narration but never on an anime ill do my best
2093941 i like miyazakis movies so much they are of a magnificent scale and full of dreams and hope itll change my happiness
2093942 im very much honored to join miyazakis film im looking forward to acting in spite of feeling some tension because ive never acted after recording
2093943 every studio ghibli film is wrapped up with gentle love im very happy to join such a film i love and watch often
2093944 fortunately i got the offer and instantly decided to accept it thats all i feel its really a solid task in a long time i always do things in a haphazard way and maybe its similar to fujimoto
2093945 im surprised and feel very happy because i can join miyazakis film this is my first experience to read an anime script and im looking forward to see how it will be
2093946 ive never done anime voice acting before so i was unable to make a quick decision those around me though all pushed my back and i thought it might be fate and decided accept im rather curious and looking forward to it
2093947 we once had a tie up during the release of gedo senki do you think you got success in tying up with us on gedo
2093948 at that time the agency was dentsu instead of hakuhodo maybe thats the reason
2093949 a lot of companies offer us to tie up with them and we always consider which company to be suited best for that this time it is asahi i happen to like mitsuya cider a brand of carbonated drink since i was small and got to know it is one of a asahis brands it was one of the reasons choosing them
2093950 for a company wanting to tie up with studio ghibli we wish for them to lend their hands to make a box office success we dont want them to use the movie solely for their product promotions if they do so it might spoil the movie and in the end their own company as well also movie box office is like a gamble it has a double sided uncertainty one of it is the content we arent sure if the film is interesting at least not until the completion of filming the other side is box office it doesnt always link to its perfection level so the tie upping company must believe in us
2093951 to tell the truth when i was shown the first picture of ponyo s image board i didnt feel ponyo was so cute and i was a little confused however we recently saw the trailer and learned that ponyo certainly has its charm so we stopped worrying my company believes ponyo will be a success
2093952 japan is overly full of cute kawaii things so its useless to add another cute thing to it
2093953 to tell the truth miyazaki hates pet bottles so much
2093954 no its just that he doesnt like these kind of fashions young people have pet bottled tea in the hands of those wearing dirty pants and a shoulder rucksack tea should be served at home
2093955 you know recently some people do not even possess a tea pot anymore they dont wet tea in their home
2093956 me neither i always keep 2 liters of pet bottled tea in the refrigerator
2093957 the complete checking of the pictures was already finished on may 9th and the only work that is left is to paint film and edit im planning to put the plot of
2093958 i had an interest in painting till graduating from high school though i had never seriously painted so i entered design school to find out what to do after my graduation from design school i had no regular job and screened the recruiting ads in the newspaper every morning then i found a 3 line ad mentioning wanted persons who like to paint
2093959 while i was watching them painting they were painting scenery on the kind of b4 paper that school kids use the pictures were light and bright and i wanted to try it
2093960 after i finished my job i showed them to mr kobayashi he immediately shouted to me like the shapes werent good or something like that i couldnt notice what was wrong in those days the co workers left their paintings on their desks and went back home we over timed guys used to gather at the desks and criticized those paintings disparagingly like the reason that why a certain painting was bad came from the painters bad character yes its true that ones character appears in his painting so i couldnt leave the office earlier than others it was strange like if i had something hidden in my paintings
2093961 basically i use poster color because as we have to paint much we cant use expensive paint poster colors can show brightness or depth of color and above all it is easy to use talking about brushes i use only two kinds of brushes hira fude flat brush and sakuyo fude pointed brush for example a sky or feathering clouds misty distant mountains rocks plants everything rough is done only by this large hira fude old tv series anime used to be done in this way only the last finish is done by sakuyo fude carefully i paint leaves roughly with hira fude and add a few detailed leaves on it which is enough because the backgrounds of anime are shown only 3 or 4 seconds
2093962 i have used this brush for over 30 years it was given to me as a memorial when i quit working at kobayashi production
2093963 because of everyday use its tip has gotten too round so i must get a new one theyre just disposables
2093964 i brought a brush that i had used and consulted them they saw it and said that it included nylon i dont care if it includes nylon or not though they never use it and insist on using native materials
2093965 my way doesnt need digitalization and ill keep it this way if the animation industry becomes this way that it does not need hand painting ill quit my job however there is one good thing in doing things the digital way depicting clouds digitally is better than making them by hand painting in the past we painted clouds on cel book clear cels they couldnt be gradated but needed to be solid shaped we reprocessed it in one way or another and made a gradient now we paint clouds on the paper and import them with a digital process on the blue sky
2093966 i think it is common for animation background artists we paint the space especially at studio ghibli we are expected to do that i paint the backgrounds considering the scenery around it like the sound of the waves or something like that i cant paint what i havent experienced or seen when i painted sf i imagined as if i were there and imagined what i could see there as art directors background section chief must show examples to the rest of the staffs i paint boards with a mind as if i were at the location place itself
2093967 i like walking when i find a good scenery i try to see it in several ways
2093968 in my case i paint everything i see while i walk around here and stock it and when i get an order i can re paint it to fit the order i think that is my way usually i get a assignment and then begin thinking on how to paint which is a bit passive it is rather natural for me
2093969 since the hero sosuke and ponyo are just only 5 years old they behave and say everything in a very straight way
2093970 miyazakis characters are usually straight he doesnt like games or trading in love
2093971 it would be easy if they worry usually music is able to go along with a wavering mind more easily so this time im struggling
2093972 it isnt the first time miyazakis way has been like this before maybe he thinks animated characters dont have to worry because we already worry in our real life and thats enough
2093973 this time im trying a new style normally i like attaching long pieces of music and usually i have pieces of about 2 minutes in length however with ponyo many of them are 5 seconds or so very short in my idea it isnt clear when they begin and end but audiences feel the existence
2093974 over 90 of the picture has already been finished which is very fast and unusual miyazaki says that the rest is only music
2093975 how was your first time meeting miyazaki was that with nausicaa
2093976 hisaishis music is innocent so it would fit well with miyazaki being romantic and hot blooded
2093977 it was a happy meeting i worked on nausicaa and arion by yasuhiko yoshikazu both at the same time and both were tokuma movies so i almost gave up hope for the next movie laputa i didnt thought they would order me to compose for 3 movies successively so i cried when i got order call
2093978 to tell the truth this song decided the last scene for the film miyazaki listened to the song and realized what the last scene should be like so it was lucky that we made the theme song in time
2093979 i agree in fact i think miyazaki is also a great lyrics writer to tell you the honest truth songs are the ultimate form of music because when we communicate something to others first we need words and the melody helps it and affects it we need both of them absolutely so the ultimate form of music must be songs
2093980 why did you set the releasing day on july 19th thats the day we release ponyo
2093981 no we set it long before you ponyo came later than pokemon
2093982 hey fujimaki are you backing pokemon you are standing behind kubo
2093983 hehehe im backing the sky crawlers note oshii mamorus latest work which is also to be released this summer
2093984 it was more than 20 years ago i visited miyazaki to ask him to make a sequel of rupan sansei kariosutoro no shiro lupin iii the castle of cagliostro he didnt accept it though and told me about his next movie plan eagerly it was so interesting
2093985 yes like that you had hair in those days then were you a miyazaki fan in those days
2093986 by the way is pokemons character design being done by kotabe kotabe y ichi
2093987 no he is general animation supervisor sugimori is designing the characters now however we did get a lot of influence from kotabe
2093988 kotabe is a colleague of takahata and miyazaki from toei doga and they made heidi or marco together i think pokemon has some ghibli flavor because of him i guess kotabe tells the staffs to imitate ghibli
2093989 of course we must learn anything thats good from every movie there exists
2093990 you dont need to make a counterargument its the same as suzuki laughing by the way i think pokemon is such kind of movie kids find out about it spend some years and after that they leave instead of the common ghibli pattern people meet ghibli and dont leave
2093991 yes pokemon is quite different from ghibli doraemon is as well note doraemon is another shogakukan and toho character kids come and go through
2093992 why do you make the same movie every year we cant do that arent you bored
2093993 no it is interesting the same characters the same director however if you watch all of them you can see it like a space odyssey in total we won 1 time and lost 3 times to ghibli in box office yamadas smashed to pokemon 2nd
2093994 was that the one that got top of us box office
2093995 aha ghibli has never got the top in us box office they did get academy awarded though
2093996 i know pokemon got slumping with their 3th 4th and 5th film but came alive again in the middle it was great that you never gave up
2093997 yes we made a full change of it to link the version up of the nintendo game
2093998 mimi to heidi papanda to totoro the starting point of takahata and miyazaki
2093999 panda kopanda exhibition miyazaki hayao the power of image boards
2094000 it looks very good against the white body more than anything i felt it is a peaceful and calm picture
2094001 miyazaki is always excited in such a situation and as usual researched and asked those of the staff how they reached the studio
2094002 miyazaki is now obviously making progress on earth how far can he reach it scares me
2094003 the other day i talked with his wife and she also told me the same miya san will continue producing till his death he cant live without making anime
2094004 many fans ask me that they want to enjoy the movie without any prejudice one of my tasks is realizing it
2094005 i heard that my role isnt that of a human and has no dialogue it was true so i accepted it
2094006 wonderful i like it much better than howls aha can i say that
2094007 me too though i was just watching the recording i was the man who recommended you to miyazaki to do the voice acting so i have the responsibility for your recording
2094008 it is surprising to hear your mouth speaking about the name of yano akiko
2094009 her music is high grade why do you like it
2094010 i had a concert at japan society in new york at the reception after the concert many americans approached me and told that they had got to know me through my neighbors the yamadas i was so glad to hear that
2094011 wasnt it at moma the museum of modern art in new york
2094012 when moma had a project of screening all ghibli movies i also visited it with miyazaki after all movies were screened the person in charge told me that he liked yamada the best and asked me to add it to their permanent collection i was glad to hear it though i asked him never to tell it to miyazaki
2094013 by the way did you read all of the e konte storyboard
2094014 yes of course it took me a very long time though it was very interesting just as a picture book
2094015 is that so this time it is colored while usually it is all in black and white
2094016 sosuke saves ponyo and brings her in a bucket to his nursery kumiko finds out about it and tells sosuke to show her then ponyo casts a fierce glance at her the stage direction says she doesnt trust females ponyo just spits water on kumiko and kumiko begins to cry that sentence instantly got me to like ponyo
2094017 miyazaki became 67 years old and he began the generalization of his works
2094018 i think his image of females has cohered till so far as usual all female characters in ponyo are like that they precede males
2094019 kids will surely like it not only boys but girls as well girls will fall in love with sosuke i believe it will be welcomed regardless of gender or age or culture
2094020 i have no reason to live in japan but i do have some reasons to live in new york i must live in new york to create music for me life in japan is too comfortable to create
2094021 huh ive never heard of this strange we are the sponsor of this program
2094022 havent you anyway it has been decided however i hear this program is well received and i want to make it to cd how about it
2094023 this movie has something similar to mononoke in it themes like the coexistence of human and nature or the forest play an important role the film was shot on location like in beautiful forests in new zealand praha poland and so on in case of animation you can paint anything you want but our live action movie cant do that
2094024 pardon me for saying so but i cant agree with you on this point we never paint landscapes we have never seen location hunting is one of the things we always do and we paint only what we saw
2094025 miyazaki once got a letter from kurosawa after we sent our videos to him
2094026 i watched all of the videos of course totoro is wonderful kiki is also very nice and nausicaa is needless to say
2094027 but what impressed me the most is hotaru no haka grave of the fireflies its the greatest movie of all of them you are really talented
2094028 well i know fathers most favorite was totoro and he cried when he watched kiki but the next day he watched hotaru his eyes were terribly swollen of crying
2094029 while he was alive we projected a talk with kurosawa and miyazaki for a magazine i remember miyazaki was very nervous like a young student in front of kurosawa but the most surprising thing for me was that kurosawa seemed to be a person of very fine character
2094030 no i had never seen such a person mannered very gentle graceful and confident i realized that he had made himself fine in the same way he had made his movies with a big effort compared to him miyazaki takahata or me are very selfish i always want miyazaki to become a person with a fine character but still has a looong way to go
2094031 this movie made my destiny and because of this i love it
2094032 i moved the location of hans christian andersens little mermaid to the japan of today and cut off the catholic color it will show an adventure and love of small kids
2094033 it will be a movie kind to the old as well as kids
2094034 this is a story about a fish kid that has a selfish wish to get along with sousuke a human boy and carries out her intention meanwhile it is a story about the 5 year old boy sousuke carrying out his promise
2094035 a small town by the shore and a house on a cliff there are not many characters the sea is like a creature a world where magic appears in unconcern i animated the sea not as a background but as a main character
2094036 a boy and a girl love and life i try to depict those without any hesitation and try to counter the age of nervous disease and angst
2094037 details of takahatas new film revealed in twenty second radio ghibli
2094038 ujiie likes and respects takahata very much typically he changes his delivery when he talks to either takahata or miyazaki chatty when talking to miyazaki polite when talking to takahata talking about takahata i read the original novel of hotaru hotaru no haka grave of the fireflies when i was 18 years old and liked it when we began ghibli i proposed it to takahata i projected a double feature of totoro and hotaru as miyazaki and takahata were both rivals as well as best colleagues and it should have been very attractive
2094039 in those days hara hara toru was the president of studio ghibli and he opposed me so much
2094040 its impossible you know theatrical animation needs so much budget time and staff in the whole history of animation there isnt an animation studio that ever made two full length feature films both at a time even toei has never done that you plan it because you are just amateur
2094041 anyway at last we started the project in those days our staff wasnt that large as it nowadays is in a flash miyazaki sensibly drew most of the staff first and hence takahata got none however kondou master animator and director of whisper of the heart kondou yoshifumi kon chan for short had yet to decide which to choose in fact miyazaki wanted kon chan even if he would lose all of his other staff because only kon chan could draw better than miyazaki
2094042 takahata also wanted kon chan though he didnt say anything
2094043 it will be impossible to make hotaru without kon chan
2094044 on the night i made the decision i visited miyazakis office in asagaya he was writing the
2094045 i can imagine what youll say kon chan will join hotaru right ok ill enter a hospital tomorrow due to inflammation of the tendon sheath if i give up toroto because of kon chan it might be stupid but if its because of my illness the double featuring with hotaru will be given up as well
2094046 ghibli is always on the side of weak people loves nature and is kind to the environment
2094047 once a month i have talk with ujiie and he often tells me he wants to see one more takahata film before he dies ujiie was born 1926 and so is now at an age of 81
2094048 it is your responsibility that film has not been made
2094049 does it mean takahatas films remind him of his youth
2094050 right the other day ujiie and takahata hotly discussed surprisingly he remembers so many of its content anyway we are planning to base takahatas new film on a japanese lullaby japanese lullabies are a bit different from other ones usually in the west a lullaby is for cradling a baby in contrast to this japanese lullabies were usually sung by babysitters to comfort themselves instead of the baby back in the old days babysitters were indentured servants and they were from impoverished villages in the cradle songs they sang about their sad circumstances melancholy or nostalgia for their village when ujiie heard this he instantly began singing itsuki no komori uta from its 1st to 5th verse using his surprising power of memory
2094051 to us music industry experts the way of ghibli music is terribly messed up we are always surprised and amazed by it for us we have many kinds of formats and rules on how to handle our music business we are chained to things like record companies and music publishers however in your case you always act freely and are even successful with it perhaps its because no one chains you we envy you
2094052 well because we are just amateurs we dont know any formats or rules
2094053 talking about that the japanese movie industry produced a lot of good movies during japans poor period after its ww2 defeat good movies dont necessarily need richness and wealth on a related note miyazaki is currently producing ponyo and it has some morse code appearing in it though nowadays it isnt really used anymore it is quite useful if we dont have access to internet or other modern forms of communication by the way miyazaki really doesnt like pcs internet or other digital tools he is always angry at me for using e mail
2094054 when i read miyazakis nausicaa manga i was impressed by a certain scene in it they use lost high tech mining engines that they can fix and maintain but cant produce themselves it didnt feel real when i read it but nowadays a similar thing is happening around me as well these days we often use a sampling technique to record music we can digitally create any kind of sound making live drums of strings performances unnecessary the result is that many young musicians and engineers havent heard live drums or strings and dont possess a proper technique to record them recording drums sounds isnt easy but in fact they cant read musical scores either miyazakis forebode came true amazing if we now record live performances we get many complaints of piano pedal noise guitar strings rustling or whispering musicians
2094055 yoda made the ghibli pages on yomiuri online he didnt get any acceptance from us is it possible the page is hidden at the end of the website he knows that aged people like me or miyazaki cant handle the internet laughing i was surprised to see it for the first time however i have no intent to blame him but instead want to admire him newspaper writers used to be so good in the good old days
2094056 there are many public museums in tokyos metro area however for many of them it isnt easy to manage them because of the lack of visitors for example there is spirited away miyazaki and i like it very much and often visit it the governor of tokyo once visited it and liked it very much but after hearing of its management problems he began to entertain closing it we hope it will survive
2094057 if it had been true i should have seen a psychiatrist i might have been a damned kid but i dont remember it at all
2094058 yoko chan you know there appear 3 girls satsuki mei and satsukis friend michan but yoko chan doesnt exist
2094059 when mei got lost satsuki was looking for her and met a young man riding a motorbike
2094060 i remember that young girl but didnt know her name was yoko chan
2094061 in a drame normal people never care about these slight matters but asperger syndrome patients cant see the whole they only see the segments
2094062 asperger syndrome patients cant read the atmosphere and often get into trouble with people around them they never cure they have to realize it and have to go along with it through their entire lives if the parents try to cure it it just gets worse
2094063 to tell the truth when we parted from tokuma and became an independent company i searched and recruited anyone who could accede the function of studio ghibli president
2094064 born in 1948 i got old enough so i therefore once thought of retirement
2094065 weve known each other since 1991 back then disney asked us to let them handle the distribution of ghibli videos but our answer was no some years later we began to get a business relation i believe that disney helped us to make studio ghibli into a worldwide known film studio hoshino was the central figure
2094066 when i once consulted a person about changing jobs he advised me three things
2094067 work on something related to kids and dreams just like your job at disney
2094068 youve got the age to show your gratitude towards society
2094069 i worked at disney in my 30s and 40s ill work at ghibli in my 50s the most important difference between these 2 is the following walt disney died long ago and afterwards the company grew big as a global company however at studio ghibli the founders miyazaki and takahata and suzuki are still alive and creating and now ill be able to work with these living legends its really great and my most decisive point of joining studio ghibli i think my job is to support creators like miyazaki and takahata and goro suzuki has built up a good environment for creating i must keep it and i must keep a good a relation with musicians like hisaishi joe and promotion companies that always help ghibli
2094070 honestly speaking the business management of studio ghibli isnt so easy
2094071 hoshino will never come to studio ghibli the salary of a disney president is so immensely high you will never be able to pay as much as them hell search for other offers at companies that pay more
2094072 the origin of ghibli is making theatrical animation as ive been willing to dedicate myself on on site producing again ive been searching for someone who could undertake the position of president in place of me
2094073 if he does the job i can do anything i want like always
2094074 i worked at disney to give children dreams so i think it is highly attractive to work with miyazaki and takahata perhaps the management or business aspect will change but as a creating group studio ghibli will never change i will keep the environment that mr suzuki has built
2094075 im a man who wants to adhere to actual production field when we got independent from tokuma back in 2005 i spent so much energy that i couldnt handle even one movie i realized the limitations of working on both management and production
2094076 why dont you try producing live action films the huge dvd collection on your shelves almost entirely consists out of live action films
2094077 i like them very much and actually prefer them to anime but its only for watching not making them basically at first i didnt like anime so much so i could make it for business only
2094078 so at first you didnt have any vision or spirit for making films i heard of a legend of your first time meeting miyazaki you hung on him for 3 days long is it true
2094079 talking about that story i was a magazine writer and visited miyazaki for an interview at that time he was making
2094080 i would be tarnished if my interview would appear in such a cheap magazine
2094081 oh you are like toyotomi hideyoshi you must have had some something special with anime didnt you
2094082 no it was just my job and me being frustrated by his words made me behave like that anyway for several months after i stayed beside him day in day out until they finished the movie he opened up and began talking to me in those days miyazaki was young and every day he began working at 9 am and stopped at 3 am of the next day so i couldnt do any of my own job
2094083 and what did you think of cagliostro then i think it is a masterpiece and its one of my big favorites
2094084 it was very good of course then i began to want to work with him it was not because it was movie industry but because i felt comfortable around him after he did cagliostro he lost his place to make movies and i thought that i should be his producer
2094085 now i only wish we can make movies that i really want to watch
2094086 we watch the rush films that are brought in every week today i also watched one i have been often excited to see some excellent scenes
2094087 to tell the truth ive wanted to do producing of movie some day so i want to ask you this question what do you think about that for you is a movie producer a creator or a businessman
2094088 miyazaki had a close relationship with an art director named yamamoto nizo from whom hed heard about oga miyazaki assumed oga would be suitable miyazaki has this interesting trait that if he trusts you he assumes he can trust your friend as well
2094089 the aspect of totoro that impressed me most is the sequence where satsuki goes looking for mei the background convey the passage of time without oga i doubt that sequence would have worked
2094090 its as if oga has a kind of special filter that he uses to depict the quality of light its not a naturalistic effect he extracts the essence of important elements of the scene then he augments them to enrich the image what this does is change the landscape from something familiar to something that feels more like d j vu the audience shares the experience with the character
2094091 we wanted to depict reality just as it is to convey the appeal of a real in environment we had to give it a sense of immediacy
2094092 theres little detail yet everything feels so real so pristine
2094093 displaying all 600 works of kazuo ogas exhibition at the museum of contemporary art tokyo
2094094 im glad that we have an excellent douga staff they all accepted giving up national holidays
2094095 basically it was planned that only nozomi would have sung and so the demo was made in that way
2094096 we thought it was a surprising and interesting idea to have it sung by amateurs even if it wasnt ourselves even now we wonder if this is ok
2094097 when we were students we formed a band called the
2094098 i think they are very kind i got glad when i heard someone would join me in singing since i had felt lonely when it was only just me i like this song very much its so cute my father is also pleased
2094099 they often mess up i hope they make no mistakes in singing
2094100 i would like this song to be sung by parents and children together
2094101 youll surely fail if your thoughts are so shallow dont have any delusions for kids not many kids have much dreams these days basically you dont know much about kids
2094102 after a 2 hour talk we got rejection and walked to koganei station from ghibli studio feeling miserable on a cold twilight time
2094103 ah did i say such a rude thing to our important sponsor hahaha actually this is the second time having a partnership with jal the 1st time was for
2094104 i asked him to expand it to 70 minutes at least
2094105 before engagement you should consider well that in this film the airplanes must fall in the sea is it ok
2094106 this kurenai no uta is nice its romantic uta means song
2094107 so i tried to remove the swine from the movie poster and used the picture that was pinned on the wall of ginas room 5 young guys in front of a plane with marcos face vanished
2094108 the hero must be the pig he painted another picture which clearly showed porcos face note probably the second
2094109 we are showing the replica of the alcione at the reception of our head office building it is popular with our visitors
2094110 miyazaki is pleased to hear jal is displaying it for a year long and that people can enjoy seeing it it was originally made for ghibli museum and exhibited for a year we worried where to store such a large thing after the exhibition
2094111 our young mechanic staffs saw it and got interested in old planes they say they will try to build the wright brothers airplane
2094112 we will make its screen simple but though we will try to make it simple it will take thousands of man hours
2094113 i always tell my staff that if they dont like to draw by hand deliberately then they should give up animation its easy to distinguish if pictures are drawn by machines or human hands if we give up the tough way we will lose the richness in our art
2094114 we have pulled on the oars of the sailboat till so far so we will continue to do that its not bad if there exists a ship like that in the world
2094115 rather than losing sight i have stiff shoulders and losing concentration power of my optic nerves when its just one day maybe i can force myself till night but the next day i wont be able to work suffering from fatigue thats why i never continue working after having turned the off switch of my body
2094116 even if someone offers me to have a rest under the sail mast i usually tell him to give the oars to me if one takes the steer he might want to continue keeping it it might be an earthly desire rather than creative eagerness
2094117 the world is thrown into confusion more and more i dont think that animation can keep cheering up those who live in such a world but i hope i can a little maybe it is just one of my selfish desires
2094118 i saw many tiled roofs i had seen many kinds of roofing till so far but they were different from the ones from the kanto area where i grew up and lived only just seeing them was already very interesting i thought that the old means such the sea was also different from the pacific ocean where waves roll on one after another here it was calm it was interesting i hadnt thought so but finally decided to set the location there
2094119 ryu chishu had acted quite some different types of old man from the ones in ozus to yamadas movies in these movies the old acted by ryu are always balanced calm or lonely but in yume he is faithful to his desire i think its a kind of realism id like to be such an old man
2094120 actually kurosawa wanted to make each episode into a future length movie however as he was getting old and thought he hadnt much time left he just simply presented those episodes in one movie his
2094121 suzuki really likes old japanese movies the great quantity of dvds on these shelves shows it i think you know more about old movies than movie critics
2094122 in totoro the girls havent got a shadow in latter half
2094123 ive been a big fan of akafuku for 34 years and i cant count how many akafuku ive eaten so i was shocked
2094124 it is so wasteful that things are not made full use of their value
2094125 i also eat it if its within 5 minutes its a 5 minutes rule japanese are becoming sticklers for cleanliness too much these days
2094126 id like to say something about smoking as well look at the warning on this cigarette package
2094127 wow such a big description its a bit strange that the manufacturer itself makes such a big warning that it might kill the purchaser laughing
2094128 japanese have become too strict about smoking recently we cant even smoke in public streets nowadays its too extreme i read an interesting talk about smoking by yoro takeshi and yamazaki masakazu do you know whos the first ruler that ordered no smoking surprisingly it was hitler and the second was mussolini they both didnt like tobacco so prohibition of tobacco might invite facism so im smoking to fight for freedom ghibli has 3 heavy smokers takahata miyazaki and me the power of tobacco has made many ghibli movies
2094129 snow queen has started screening at cinema angelica in shibuya when miyazaki was a student the characters and story of the manga he used to draw in those days were rather dark one day he watched snow queen and was beaten by gerda the girl protagonist since then for over 40 years miyazaki recalls her when making female characters like chihiro mirai shonen konan s lana and ponyo
2094130 thank you for riding this train youll arrive at studio ghibli soon if you transfer to neko bus my neighbor totoros catbus please change here exit doors will be at the right side
2094131 its different from the plan that was arranged earlier miya san is angry
2094132 im glad to get such a good song i would like to reach a good happy ending to go with it but i havent completed the storyboard so i think ill have to hurry
2094133 fortunately when i was showed the a part and b part of the e conte storyboard i immediately got the theme melody
2094134 maybe all of you are wondering why 2 of these unknown middle aged men are here
2094135 im jealous small kids statements are always welcomed as theyre so simple
2094136 i handed him a memo paper but i cant remember what i asked him please ask hisaishi maybe he remembers
2094137 i got a long note like a love letter of course its love isnt for me but love for the movie it was over 10 pages long i guess in the beginning creators havent got a complete image of what they want and just have some core images i felt images like ponyo coming or the mother of the sea
2094138 can you tell me about the story if you can
2094139 later the producer will tell something except the story anyway till so far we have used computers to make our movies but i came to think that having paddles and raising the sails is better so this time we decided to throw off any 3d cg and must make it with pencils only as it needs so many hand drawn pictures i cant guess how much pictures we must draw maybe it will be unprecedented i think hand drawing on paper is the fundamental of animation
2094140 miya san is cool headed today he fended the question well he didnt say anything about the contents of the movie
2094141 if its played at the opening many of the audiences might go out for picnic
2094142 we heard the storyboard is delayed can you make it in time
2094143 i dont think its so much delayed anyway we must draw so many by hand so we are struggling now
2094144 i think the song has a fathers theme this is your first film after your son goro directed gedo senki last year are you conscious of it
2094145 we cant make a movie if we have such evil in mind
2094146 while the lyrics and music was left unclear we asked her to sing a demo when we listened to it we were stunned by its innocence we ojisans aged men were beaten thats all i hope fuji fuji not to spoil nozomis innocence
2094147 this spring we had a talk about management weve been producing
2094148 no mr suzuki ponyo shouldnt aim to make a profit i dont even want to recover this time
2094149 you also are the executive board member of this company we must consider about management and stockholder income as well
2094150 no this time ill never make an effort to get a hit basically the movies that became a big hit are all second rate ones ive regretted that ive lent a hand to make a hit
2094151 it means he has made so many second rate anime
2094152 initially we planned the cd to be released in march 2008
2094153 well i would like to give it to my children as a christmas present
2094154 so it is very simple in design i didnt aim to go maniac
2094155 well have a press conference about the cd tomorrow monday gt today i wonder if miyazaki will talk about the details of ponyo if he does i cant stop it and must leave things to chance in fact one of the reasons i asked him to be on the interview is that he might recognize the fact that he should finish the storyboard soon we need it before the year ends our progress of work is now delaying a lot
2094156 there will always be a distance between people and even between things that seem within ones reach and that one must walk down a long thin and winding road before they reach ones heart theres tons of obstacles its in fact like the roads in old towns

2094170 we believe it is important that the public be aware that ncsft had no involvement in the placement of katelynn sampson in the home of donna irving and warren johnson
2094171 this was a private arrangement between donna irving and bernice sampson under the childrens law reform act
2094172 the worst thing ive seen in 20 years of policing
2094173 transcripts of the proceedings reveal an alarming absence of consideration of the best interest of katelynn sampson
2094174 justice paulseth appears to have dealt with the matter of this childs custody in a cavalier and overly causal manner i submit to you that justice paulseth failed to meet even a minimal standard
2094175 a thorough investigation of a proposed caregivers background should be a key requirement in the process of determining his or her suitability as a substitute parent
2094176 this is a mandated and automatic part of the placement process employed by childrens aid societies in order to ensure a childs safety and best interests

2094189 es macht gro en spa mit meiner mannschaft zu arbeiten
2094190 sie setzen meine vorgaben um und zeigen auch dann geduld wenn nicht alles nach plan l uft ich habe schon vor dem hinspiel gesagt dass es keine berraschung w re wenn wir gegen anderlecht gewinnen w rden wir sind sehr erfahren und haben gen gend gute spieler die ich nicht schlecht machen lasse das ergebnis gegen anderlecht hat uns nicht berrascht
2094191 anderlecht hat gut gespielt sie haben uns gro e probleme bereitet vor allem in der zweiten halbzeit als sie nichts mehr zu verlieren hatten ich denke anderlecht hat uns am anfang untersch tzt f r sie ist es eine schande gegen eine mannschaft aus belarus zu verlieren im r ckspiel waren sie schon motivierter aber wir waren zu stark gegen levski ist jetzt alles offen
2094192 das ist nicht nur ein schock das ist eine totale katastrophe ich spiele seit sieben jahren f r anderlecht und ich kann mich nicht erinnern dass wir jemals so fr h ausgeschieden sind aber was sollen wir machen unser gegner war st rker wir m ssen uns sch men ein grund ist vielleicht dass die saison in belgien noch nicht begonnen hat bate hat trotzdem in beiden spielen guten fu ball gezeigt
2094193 wir haben uns das leben selbst schwer gemacht wir haben es sowohl zu hause als auch ausw rts mit diesen beiden roten karten verschenkt ob ich erwarte dass einige spieler den verein verlassen wenn man ausscheidet muss man sich auch ber die finanzielle situation ein bild machen wir m ssen analysieren wie wir diesen finanziellen verlust durch transfers ausgleichen k nnen

2094220 i was proud to be one of the south carolina finalists chosen to attend national history day
2094221 it was a fantastic experience seeing more than 2 000 students from all over the country who had one thing in common we had all made it to the national competition for history day i was proud to represent our state and my school my paper was about wild horse annies campaign to save the wild mustang the topic interested me because i love horses and like to compete in equestrian events i picked a topic that interested me and enjoyed doing the research required to write the paper
2094222 because of the length of distance that exists across queen street on the diagonal from east to west its a very long walk in terms of distance and time
2094223 that has a significant impact on the traffic movements it causes a bank up of traffic and it has a significant impact on the function of the intersection
2094224 the labor party would have looked at this in 2002 when they made the changes to this intersection
2094225 so what we are going to do is add an audio device to the various press button locations
2094226 it will be a very much an in your face device for pedestrians giving them a warning
2094227 it will be a voice it will be the first pedestrian signal where we have added an audio device to the crossing
2094228 at the road paintings at the edge of the road entries in each direction we will do some reinforcement works there
2094229 ive looked at that this morning to be honest it was the first question i asked
2094230 because of the other movements in other directions it just wont work
2094231 moving the traffic island changes the pattern of movements you then have a line of traffic which cuts through their pathway as pedestrians as well it just further complicates the movements with traffic
2094232 the show has been very successful and were getting a great buzz around town
2094233 weve been getting great crowds and thats essentially because of the great word of mouth weve been getting
2094234 we look at a production and see if it works for us and this show is a natural
2094235 and ultimately that benefits membership there is an educational and conservation component to this and its not all just show
2094236 thats pretty difficult but generally we can train them pretty quickly
2094237 we have about 30 birds in the show and theyre all comfortable and familiar with the zoos environment

2094643 under the partnership bp will pay verenium 90 million over the next 18 months for the rights to vereniums cellulosic ethanol production technology in turn bp will develop commercially viable environmentally sound cellulosic ethanol plants in the united states and possibly abroad

2094652 thats true to a different extent with different teams iowa is one of those teams wisconsin is one of those teams and purdue is one of those teams that were missing a lot of key components in the spring i think iowa looks great they have depth
2094653 it could be michigan state it could be iowa it could be michigan then i think you have the next level with teams like northwestern that will probably go to a bowl game but wont be in the eight win range
2094654 all that you dont necessarily expect from a major college coach he struck me as a guy who remembers your name and is interested in helping you out hes been great

2094682 i currently prefer fusion for its low impact on other os x applications support for multiple virtual cpus and huge library of virtual appliances
2094683 i have reason to believe fusion has better program support in general
2094684 the key differences between parallels and vmware are that vmware fusion features 64 bit processing support meaning it can run windows vista ultimate 64 bit microprocessors this not only enables mac users to run windows but it also supports solaris linux and more than 60 different x86 optimized operating systems
2094685 vmware is much faster and doesnt slow down my entire system like parallels does
2094686 temperature and other environmental factors are very different from those for conventional ics
2094687 professional criminals are targeting weak points in the laws by stealing vehicles for their parts
2094688 they are using the rest of the car for scrap which has the added benefit of removing fingerprints and dna and providing financial rewards because of the increased price of scrap metal
2094689 the laws were designed to address traditional rebirthing practices where someone would take a number plate or a vehicle identification number from a wrecked car and put it on a stolen car
2094690 the criminals have come up with new ways of conducting their activities and we need new ways to address that at a time when used cars have never been more affordable do we really need these 27 000 or so cars in the market
2094691 if every manufacturer used microdots police could get the original identification number of each part and say yes that car was stolen in sydney six months ago

2094708 a factually inaccurate alarmist and exploitive new campaign called the cancer project is aimed at scaring parents and school systems out of feeding children processed meats it is just what those of us who know the physicians committee for responsible medicine pcrm have come to expect from this pro vegetarian animal rights group in doctors clothing
2094709 children are notoriously picky eaters but they enjoy many processed meats and derive essential vitamins minerals protein and amino acids to the diet
2094710 uneaten bowls of lentil artichoke stew or potato cauliflower curry two of pcrms suggested recipes contribute nothing to a childs diet
2094711 just as consumers need to eat a healthy and balanced diet they need balanced information

2094883 besides faith must constantly express humility before god indeed adoration and praise
2094884 moreover our radical belonging to christ and the fact that we are in him must imbue in us an attitude of total trust and immense joy

2095040 faptul ca ratele dobanzilor au fost crescute in intreaga europa de est a avut un efect asupra pietelor si asupra comportamentului companiilor si al consumatorilor dar e destul de probabil ca urmarile sa fie cu mult mai putin pronuntate decat in economiile dezvoltate
2095041 seconda traccia dellalbum un p una difesa alla generazione di allora e di oggi accusata di non aver valori per questo mi rivolgo a fabrizio de andr

2095050 it was amazing i could go through every adjective i know amazing incredible exciting awesome it still doesnt do it justice
2095051 the best part about it was walking along and looking up in the stands and seeing maple leaves canadians in red standing up and then chinese in red standing up and waving canadian flags so many maple leaves i felt like i was walking into the stadium in toronto
2095052 the coolest part was hearing everyone in the tunnel singing o canada i had chills as i walked into the stadium
2095053 they hope that through the olympics the international community will get a better sense of where china is today which they say is a very modern and very different china from a few years ago
2095054 a lot is on the line for the chinese government certainly also for the chinese people there is so much pride and nationalism here
2095055 this has been a very ominous video tape that has emerged it shows the 2008 logo up in flames and also a simulated explosion over one of the venues
2095056 for a supposed multicultural world or at least its being pushed on western countries aka white countries there certainly wasnt a lot of multicultural people at these opening ceremonies a lot of black hair
2095057 why dont you buy a case of fruit for yourself

2095067 to promote protect and prevent violations of human rights in general and economic social and cultural ecs rights in particular to provide effective aid to those victims of such violations and to enhance the quality of community life in marginalized gaza sectors
2095068 worst year under occupation 2008 1st quarter report on israeli violations of human rights in the gaza strip
2095069 investigate pursue and prosecute those who ordered and or perpetrated these crimes
2095070 person we need to take up this vital mission an experienced leader who can address the regional security challenges comprehensively and at the highest levels
2095071 extremely critical of israels policies in the territories and its attitude toward the palestinian authoritys pa security services
2095072 arousing considerable discomfort its conclusions about israel are scathing and those whove seen it say it make s israel look very bad
2095073 one of the greatest human rights crimes on earth and to see europeans going along with this is embarrassing
2095074 the top opinion pollster in ramallah said that opinion on the west bank is shifting to hamas because people believe fatah sold out to israel and the us
2095075 i think the sea probably is polluted sometimes i get strange white marks on my skin but we come down to the beach each day because we have nowhere else to go
2095076 sewage pipe pours mucky water into streams of dark waste that flow towards the sea
2095077 the sea is getting dirtier and more contaminated because of chronic fuel and spare parts shortages we need 14 days of uninterrupted power in order to run a proper sewage treatment cycle for the sake of gazas public health
2095078 waterborne outbreaks are to be avoided because of their capacity to result in the simultaneous infection of a high proportion of the community
2095079 restrictions are a clear violation of the universal right to health and a clean environment under international humanitarian law israel as an occupying power is obligated to facilitate access to all essential to life amenities access to clean drinking and sea water are basic human rights
2095080 the idf will probably stop us but part of the point is to show that gaza is closed off
2095081 growing alliance of trade unions community groups faith groups women and youth organisations ngos and other campaigners working together across more than 100 national platforms to end poverty inequality
2095082 abide by international and humanitarian law and un resolutions immediately end its collective punishment policy
2095083 we are living in fear of the devastation of our society
2095084 the blockade makes export impossible so farmers are abandoning their crops israeli incursions result in huge destruction to lands and enterprises almost every industry in gaza is facing ruin this collective punishment must end
2095085 gaza alone without the west bank cannot survive it needs free borders and access 1
2095086 how can gaza be a normal place how can we live a normal life here
2095087 this might initiate other actions in neighboring countries so we can continue doing this in a coordinated fashion throughout the european union
2095088 that would be a good way to fight these crimes
2095089 one ordinary guy is giving the candidates a reason to run
2095090 i am thinking how did he score 99 goals thats what i thought
2095091 calgary is a part of the worldwide olympic community and it is important for us to ensure we are building the olympic spirit whenever we can
2095092 we want to light the olympic cauldron to remind calgarians that they play a great role in providing the crucial training facilities our canadian athletes need to make it to the olympics
2095093 my hearts just racing i just have so much adrenalin right now it really brings back a lot of memories of salt lake city and torino when i was an athlete at those games
2095094 ive being doing this sport for 10 years and every time i see the olympic flag up i know its a special two week period and it really does inspire us and its going to inspire another generation of athletes coming up through the ranks
2095095 its big for us to hopefully keep on a good run here because were far from out of the race thats the team attitude
2095096 it was the best experience of my life thus far
2095097 as we were coming through the tunnel we were singing o canada a couple times
2095098 its energy from a canadian perspective and energy from a global perspective as well its pretty awesome
2095099 but he has really laid the groundwork for some of the right stuff offensively
2095100 we have an understanding were going to talk at end of season
2095101 cito has created a great buzz with the team on and off the field fans love him and i have not seen too many media guys taking shots at him
2095102 the players obviously love him im pretty positive about things i like what i have seen so far
2095103 because someone uploaded it theres no moderation theres no way to guarantee it wont turn bad
2095104 i really feel strongly about my campaign because i absolutely believe that both jim himes and chris shays are in the pocket of special interest groups
2095105 i believe breaking the stranglehold that special interest groups have on congressmen and senators will be my top priority
2095106 aipac the american israel public affairs committee wield a lot of power and if they wield a lot of power in washington they wield a lot of power worldwide theyre setting the agenda in washington why do you think weve been unable to resolve the palestinian question
2095107 the economy is really bad in our area and by the economy im including unemployment as well
2095108 if we have 100 000 illegal immigrants working at jobs in our area thats 100 000 jobs that americans dont have my campaign motto is if you save american jobs you save the american economy
2095109 im against outsourcing and i think a high percentage of those jobs need to come back here and we need a law passed to that effect
2095110 these are american companies they should be providing american jobs
2095111 take a beautiful building like the g e plant on boston avenue in bridgeport thats a great structure very solid a local entrepreneur could help bridgeport by taking that facility and opening it up for small businesses thats good for bridgeport and the local economy and the businesses could be anything a bakery a print shop you name it
2095112 i think we should work with local zoning boards and when a big box store applies for a permit the facility is offered to a local entrepreneur for him to develop
2095113 that way the town can capitalize on the research done by the national chain but the dollars will stay in the hands of local investors
2095114 something that nobody talks about is there is almost no public transportation to towns north of route 15
2095115 towns like weston monroe and even trumbull have little or no access so people have to use their cars public transportation needs to be extended to these towns
2095116 and our train system needs to be revamped for the first time in history we have more people taking the train to work in fairfield county than are taking the train to work in new york the system needs to be changed

2095119 while i was running an experiment at the caltech brain imaging center a group of students happened to pass by on a tour and i volunteered to explain what i was doing
2095120 as part of the experiment a moving display was running on my computer screen with dots rapidly expanding out somewhat like the opening scene of star wars
2095121 does anyone else hear something when you look at that
2095122 i queried a few hundred people and three more individuals turned up
2095123 do you hear sounds when you see things move or flash
2095124 people with auditory synesthesia may be even less likely than people with other synesthetic associations to fully realize that their experience is unusual these individuals have an enhanced soundtrack in life rather than a dramatically different experience compared to others
2095125 synesthetes had an advantage because they not only saw but also heard the visual patterns
2095126 this translation might result in actual sound perception in synesthetes perhaps due to stronger than normal connections says saenz who has begun brain imaging experiments to study this connectivity in synesthetes and nonsynesthetes
2095127 we might find that motion processing centers of the visual cortex are more interconnected with auditory brain regions than previously thought even in the normal brain
2095128 at this point very little is known about how the auditory and visual processing systems of the brain work together understanding this interaction is important because in normal experience our senses work together all the time
2095129 consider a text of a message sent by a particular historical figure to another and which is being examined by a historian the historian wishes to determine exactly what the person who sent the message meant and what the person who received the message understood by it so that she can draw a connection among various events surrounding the message it would do the historian no good in view of her purpose to understand the text of the message in ways different from the ways in which it was understood by the author and receiver of the message for that would lead to a misconstruction of history
2095130 determining exactly what the person who sent the message meant
2095131 it is true that kareena was offered a role in chamera which is to be directed by daniel silverman but she has not signed on the dotted lines
2095132 kareena is busy for the next one and a half year with her commitments in bollywood until then she isnt doing any international film besides chamera kareena was also offered two other hollywood films which i cannot divulge much into

2095136 look how beautifully the waves move and how the sun shines through the water showing the transparency it almost looks like the cove dont you think i will have it professionally reframed and hang it over the fireplace look at the quality it must be a masterpiece of some sort worth thousands of dollars
2095137 weve been shopping and i have only 50 00 cash left will you take that
2095138 it looks to me to be of the luminous school what do you think douglas
2095139 perhaps its out of the hudson river school its an excellent example of romantic realism i would say bierstadt or marple margaret and i have a landscape by fredrick church hanging in our living room had to have it insured for 1 000 000 sorenson have you had it authenticated yet how much did you pay for it
2095140 its sort of embarrassing and i really didnt want to talk about it
2095141 the previous owner didnt know what he had on his hands and i dont want him to find out i am having it authenticated but you see i really got a steal i only paid 7500 00 for it
2095142 it was the hardest decision of my career and im suffering a lot to have to let go of my dream juliana said in a statement released by her management company and translated from portuguese
2095143 we fought during four years to get to the olympics and i wont be able to be by larissa on the court
2095144 juliana had a very courageous and noble act larissa said
2095145 its not easy to make this decision after so many days of suffering and sacrifice im sorry that she is not in condition to be by my side in this moment that we had dreamed so much for our careers
2095146 i tried everything grabbed all the possibilities given to me by the professionals who evaluated me but unfortunately i reached my limit juliana said
2095147 we knew that this could have happened but we always worked with the expectation that i would play
2095148 there was no more time for doubts and the decision had to be mine she said
2095149 i thought a lot about it and realized that it wouldnt be fair to larissa the technical staff and the brazilian people for me to play without the ideal conditions to do well in the olympics

2095297 the reading borough council licensing policy statement states that public houses located in and catering for residential areas wishing to open beyond 11pm will need to demonstrate clearly that public nuisance will not result from later operation in this case i do not believe that the applicant has demonstrated this to be the case the areas of concern are the hours of operation proposed noise from people leaving the venue throughout the night the structure is not adequately insulated to stop break out noise noise from the outdoor area i am concerned that due to the close proximity of the premise to residential properties the measures outlined in section p d of the application are not sufficient to prevent a public nuisance since the premise licence was issued we have received a number of complaints from nearby residents with reference to noise break out and shouting from the activities at the club an investigation into this matter is being undertaken by the environmental protection team and until a resolution is found it would not be appropriate to permit an extension to the operating hours of the club evidence and visits by staff suggest that a public nuisance is being caused i am concerned that in order to play music at a volume that would be satisfactory to patrons works will be required to the structure of the premises to ensure that the noise is contained until the applicant has instructed an acoustic consultant to carry out a survey and submit a report detailing the works that would be required to provide adequate sound insulation and any other steps that would be required to prevent breakout noise for example noise limiters controlling certain frequencies of sound the extended hours should not be given once implemented there should be a further survey to demonstrate that the works have been completed to a satisfactory standard and these have been agreed with the environmental protection team until these works have been completed i would recommend that the premises is not granted an extension to the licence

2095352 gab2 is a signalling protein which means that its involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the interior of the cell instructing it to do specific things such as divide or migrate
2095353 gab2 performs a number of signalling roles in normal cells throughout the body and is usually switched off when its not needed our task has been to work out how the body switches off gab2 so that we can mimic that process in abnormal cells
2095354 weve identified a completely novel mechanism for switching off gab2 this uses another molecule that attaches to gab2 and acts as a kind of shield preventing it from transmitting further proliferative signals
2095355 this binding partner or off switch is called 14 3 3 and is used to disable gab2 in a number of cellular settings when it is no longer needed
2095356 as gab2 plays key roles in signalling systems that underpin both normal physiological responses and oncogenesis its very important to understand its control mechanisms
2095357 our next step will be to obtain more structural information about how 14 3 3 shields gab2 once we know that it should be possible to design drugs to combat

2095370 its fine to say you are getting rid of undesirable customers but that means you have to make significant growth someplace else to make up for it
2095371 we are not in a position to deliver sustained revenue growth but we believe we have a good plan in place
2095372 i dont have a crystal ball about what will happen down the line

2095376 you can go home and explain to your constituents how you refused to move forward on some of the most sensitive issues that are in our legislative portfolio in the congress today
2095377 we will not be able to take these up at a later time and well have to wait until a new congress and in the meantime there will be much suffering and mental distress
2095378 well go back and try to work with everybody on the concerns we have with each the bills and see if we can get them so they can go through by unanimous consent
2095379 they shouldnt be a package the package was a way to try to get rid of one of the rights of the minority in the senate
2095380 so women will continue to suffer and sen coburn can explain to them why they should suffer just because of his obstinacy
2095381 i dont know what we can do given the time constraints
2095382 youll see another omnibus public lands bill we wont fund taking care of the national parks but well add more land to them and give them more to do
2095383 the fact that they do not even know that a bigger customs union is being planned shows that their ideas have not been solicited
2095384 this is because these smaller members of sacu do not benefit much from the protective function of the external tariff regime because almost all the industries protected by the tariff regime are located in south africa which is the dominant member of sacu the revenue sharing formula is therefore being used to appease the blns countries so that they do not make noise about the skewed distribution of industries within sacu
2095385 the establishment of a broader sadc customs union is bound to impact positively on the blns countries in two important ways first it will enable the blns countries to diversify sources of their imports currently these countries get good proportions of their imports from south africa because of the current protective tariff wall created by the sacu external tariff regime
2095386 we will have access to a bigger market a bigger customs union will bring about stiffer competition among producers of goods and services which in turn will lead to higher productivity and efficiency the scales of production will be in favour of everyone in the region
2095387 sacu led to the integrated and coordinated economic development of its members even though a certain polarisation whereby big businesses are concentrated in south africa took place revenue shared among sacu countries has not just helped those countries fiscally but has given them the chance to develop economically it is up to the political leaders in those countries to use the revenue to develop their countries
2095388 this is the reality of the situation and until there is a bigger union there is no use trying to against thunder however i think this polarisation will end once there is a bigger customs union but sadc countries need to develop the skills of their people and do something about their production capacity to survive the impending competition
2095389 south african products are cheaper than products from smaller sacu countries which have relied on south african products to satisfy their domestic needs it is therefore impossible for products from smaller sacu members to compete with south african products even in their own domestic markets leave alone the south african market
2095390 theoretically a broader regional integration will increase the market and increase prospects for economic growth and development
2095391 the natural trade partners for primary goods producers are industrialized countries and the scope for trade within sadc is limited only south africa and to a lesser extent zimbabwe in sadc can provide adequate manufactured products in addition even in this field the range of products remains limited no competitive supply can be found within the region for numerous branches motor vehicles for instance so the eu will be the boss in this area

2095398 atonement language includes several evocative metaphors there is a sacrificial metaphor offering and a legal metaphor justification and an interpersonal metaphor reconciliation and a commercial metaphor redemption and a military metaphor ransom each is designed to carry us to the
2095399 knowing that the metaphor is not the thing leads to important implications not the least of which is to admit in humility that we can have proper confidence in the god who atones by indwelling each of the many metaphors that lead us to the god who atones we need each of them we need each of them becauase each them in its own language game of metaphorical exploration and imagination leads us to the core of it all reconiliation which is a metaphor with god self others and the world
2095400 a tonement is only understood when it is understood as the restoration of humans in all directions so that the form a society the ecclesia the church wherein gods will is lived out and given freedom to transform all of life any theory of atonement that is not an ecclesial theory of the atonement is inadequate
2095401 to be forgiven to be atoned for to be reconciled synonymous expressions is to be granted a mission to become a reciprocal performer of the same to forgive to work atonement and to be an agent of reconciliation thus atonement is not just something done to us and for us
2095402 a tonement is something done not only by god for us but also something we do with god for others atonement is praxis i t is embodied in what god does for us in such a way that we a summoned to participate with god in gods redemptive work

2095539 to bypass the neurotoxicity new anti mitotics are being generated early clinical studies show that these drugs do not result in significant neurotoxicity the big question now is whether they will have anti tumour effects
2095540 to help determine this we need to know which types of tumours are likely to be sensitive to these new agents and which ones are likely to be resistant
2095541 to predict which types of tumours are likely to respond we first need to know how anti mitotic drugs work both the classical drugs and these new agents
2095542 we know that anti mitotic drugs block the final stage of the cell division process mitosis how the cells then die is a mystery
2095543 we embarked on a fresh more direct approach that is actually quite simple basically we just watched the cells using time lapse microscopy this allowed us to track the behaviour of individual cells and determine their fate when exposed to different anti mitotic drugs
2095544 the first thing we realised was that the picture was much more complicated that we originally thought the range of different behaviours was profound not only did cells from different cell lines behave differently but cells within the same line also behaved differently
2095545 the level of complexity was at first overwhelming however as we slowly made our way through the data patterns began to emerge this allowed us to formulate a new hypothesis we were then able to design more experiments to test this hypothesis
2095546 in essence it turns out that when cells are exposed to these drugs they arrest in mitosis
2095547 the factors influencing the race not only vary from cell line to cell line but also within cells from the same line explaining why there is so much complexity
2095548 what we want to do now is figure out how we can help the cell death pathway win the race more often this would hopefully mean that the anti mitotic drugs would be better at killing cancer cells first we want to test this idea in the lab but hopefully in the longer run this will mean that these drugs can be used more effectively in the clinic
2095549 karen a talented graduate student worked very hard on this study and the work was only possible because the faculty recently bought a fully automated microscope that allowed us to analyse such large numbers of cells

2095576 i will take back the considerable interest that continues to be there on a free trade agreement
2095577 the united states should be committed to a free trade agreement

2095584 oh i got released from an nda the other day so i can finally say that i wrote a bunch of the groundwork backstory and structure on the forthcoming ea videogame dead space which recently got a comic prequel from the hands of antony johnston and ben templesmith
2095585 i believe there was at least one other writer on the project but im sure theres some of me in there somewhere
2095586 i was surprised at how much punishment that guy took

2095589 what would the impact be if every church in one city unified together and swept that city telling people about the love of god what if every church and every member went out on the streets in that city and helped the homeless were talking about hundreds upon hundreds of christians reaching out and giving food and help to those in need could it end problems we have or some of them would people get saved it is time for pastors to become leaders that join together the body of christ and challenge people that church is more than sitting in the pews on sunday that it is okay to come together with churches and reach out to the world
2095590 look what portland a city known for being secular was able to achieve when the churches and city came together in unity in christ
2095591 should asus make this available outside the eee pc bundle
2095592 if the kb mouse combo was the best control device this wouldnt be needed
2095593 besides if the kb mouse combo was the best control device this wouldnt be needed thats the point
2095594 we must look at the substantial successes we have been able to achieve but also reflect on how far we have to go
2095595 governments in the past have been complicit in genocides land seizures massive environmental degradation and many other human rights abuses because indigenous peoples were denied their fundamental rights and freedoms
2095596 this shows how far we still have to go to make sure that states acknowledge and protect indigenous peoples rights for if they continue not to we have many examples of the grave results
2095597 appropriate legislative or administrative measures to prevent the acts of transnational corporations on indigenous territories
2095598 reconciliation between indigenous peoples and states can take many forms that differ from country to country
2095599 generally it involves recognition for past injustices justice for victims and the healing of relationships
2095600 the result of more than two decades of negotiations the declaration provides a momentous opportunity for states and indigenous peoples to strengthen their relationships promote reconciliation and ensure that the past is not repeated
2095601 a manifestation of reconciliation between indigenous peoples and states and a mechanism for carrying that reconciliation forward
2095602 the wider public must understand indigenous peoples rights and concerns
2095603 they must act to protect them because as the most marginalised group in this world it spells out how the rest of us will be treated and is also the surest way to protect our last remaining ecosystems
2095604 we are operating in a very difficult environment and our results generated one of the smallest reductions in second quarter margins among north american carriers
2095605 the second quarter result demonstrated the difficulty of increasing revenues at the same rapid pace as the increase in the price of jet fuel however our customers will eventually have to absorb the higher cost
2095606 we have long cautioned that domestic supply growth could outpace demand growth in 2008 and hence air canadas decision to trim capacity growth is clearly a positive for the industry as a whole
2095607 there were flames coming from all parts of the house it was deemed at that time that it was unsafe to go inside so we fought it from the outside
2095608 there were two people here when we arrived a father and son the father suffered some minor burns i think they were trying to find their pets but we understand that all three dogs got out of the house
2095609 we did receive one unconfirmed report that they saw flames on the back porch so that might suggest that maybe a barbecue
2095610 we did find something in the garage and the rcmp are looking after that
2095611 the problem we ran into was jurisdiction including questions about crown land navigable waters etc we have all that sorted out
2095612 some of them have been freeloading for a very long time some of them have had a pretty good thing going by not having to pay moorage fees weve delivered the notices so the owners cant say they didnt know in the next few weeks well be removing the vessels out of our water lot
2095613 staff have tried to find some commercial space where the boats can be impounded but real estate is pretty expensive in kelowna so we may have to move them to one of our facilities including the landfill because we have space there
2095614 its been alleged that the accused fraudulently placed advertisements on line selling vintage vehicles on ebay
2095615 the victims responded to these adds and paid tens of thousands of dollars in an attempt to purchase these vehicles that money appears to have gone into banks in the calgary area the money was obtained by the accused and the victims never received their vehicles even after several years of trying
2095616 were investigating every angle to determine the involvement of other individuals
2095617 theyre in the business of making money i have never known a drug dealer who is in the business for fun if we can diminish that incentive by taking away their assets i think our communities will be better off
2095618 im not going to say thats specifically on our agenda once the team is up and running were going to prioritize our efforts and if that is one of them then that may be something that well attempt to do
2095619 the fire was located approximately 500 to 600 meters upslope from several homes in the 1000 block of westside road due to the quick action of the bcfs crews and helicopter the homes were never seriously threatened

2095626 this work helps connect our psychological understanding of why we like some things and not others with the genetic mechanisms that define our range of behaviors
2095627 in the ongoing discussion about how much the environment versus genetics determine behavior this study points to how the interaction between these factors influences our judgment and decision making
2095628 we were surprised to see that variation in the creb1 gene would account for more than 20 percent of the difference in how healthy participants weighed different options and expressed specific preferences
2095629 our previous studies and the work of other groups suggested that variation in this gene could be important for judgment and decision making by the brain but we needed to connect this to a measurable decision making effect in both behavior and brain activity

2095645 throughout the year we did see adult medical costs and pharmaceuticals for illegal immigrants that were in our system the one thing that did run the costs up was the transportation costs to move inmates to other facilities
2095646 we did run a shortfall and were requesting this amount to take care of the shortfall
2095647 this amount we earned the county and the city of manassas earned through the per diem of the federal government paying for the ice inmates in our system
2095648 the adc has collected 779 175 federal revenue in fiscal year 2008 as a result of the 287 g effort
2095649 this revenue was unbudgeted due to the uncertainty of the program size or the length of time the adc would be housing illegal immigrants

2095668 thats the last place i thought i would performing mariachi music
2095669 it only happens every four years i mean a world event its surreal

2095671 the national olympic stadium has been full each time we have rehearsed i have never been around that many people in my life
2095672 i am not really at liberty to say too much and maybe i have already
2095673 one is basically to give the organizing committee the opportunity to paint a picture about that city and that countrys culture
2095674 the second part is to talk about the fact that the olympic movement is global thats why they have mariachi and im sure they have music from other countries theyre trying to show that music is really a unifying force around the world
2095675 its significant not only for mariachi music but its significant for all female groups to be chosen for something like this

2095680 youre not going to have any fun this summer and youre going to do what we tell you
2095681 i first loved the word after hearing duke ellington use it to describe the members of his consistently brilliant bands the meaning of the term has a duality either referring to folks who dabble in appreciation of arts of culture of those who have a deep love for works or performers on returning from a funeral of a recent acquaintance who was as charming as he was caustic i was left again musing on the deep joy and befuddlement ive experienced in the company of a friends legacy more often than not the people who have left the deepest impressions on me have been those who have delicately bashed my ears with their love of music art literature and with no airs and graces more peanuts and beer ad somewhere up there is a bbq i wanna be part of ever serving the drinks some day
2095682 the view i propose is one in which the meaning of texts is determined by various factors in accordance with the cultural function of the texts in question in some cases the cultural function determines that that the authors understanding of the text is the determinant factor of the meaning and in other cases it is the audience or the context or various factors combined and so on the meaning of texts is not always determined in the same way because texts have different functions
2095683 cultures develop rules for the determination of meaning and thus rely on expertise and authority in many cases credentials are required
2095684 texts do have a core of meaning but what that core is and how stable it is depends again on the cultural function the text performs that is on how society has come to look at the text thus there is ample room for change as well as continuity and stability the point is that there cannot be uniform rules for all texts regarding these matters because texts function differently and it is the functions they have as determined by the culture that have the last word

2095686 let me say something here and if it were not so i simply would not say it
2095687 two iraqi officials say the u s and iraq are close to a deal under which all american combat troops would leave by october 2010 with remaining u s forces gone about three years later a u s official in washington acknowledges progress has been made on the timelines for a u s departure but offered no firm date another u s official strongly suggested the 2010 date may be too ambitious
2095688 i think a lot of people assume a lot of things about why square made that announcement
2095689 i think the most obvious reason that they made the announcement is just looking at the success of our console i mean were the leading console on a worldwide basis were more than double the install base on the us
2095690 so i think people make a lot of assumptions about what they read or the rumours that go around but the reality of a lot of this is that were doing very well we have a great install base we have passionate gamers like you guys that buy a lot of games and a publisher like square cant ignore that
2095691 i think its easy to assume that somethings going on behind the scenes i think the more obvious answer is were doing really well and the game creators want their games to be where the most people and the most consoles are and right now thats the xbox 360
2095692 well like to make a game thats fun to play and looks cool
2095693 final fantasy xiii only on ps3 and if they ported it without microsoft even giving them money so am i disappointed that they ported it just like that and they say that because they didnt have enough money so did they say okay to microsofts offer either is this just pr or so have se went to far with their relationship with sony as sony owns like 12 14 of their developement studios square enix makes more money from releasing it on both consoles not to mention making the game accessible across all platforms excluding the wii not sure where delaying the ps3 version to wait on the 360 version fits into the schematic of things obviously if square was doing it just to get more exposure why would they wait samsung hdtv lnt 3253h onkyo receiver sr tx605 15
2095694 we all know the sixaxis didnt have rumble because of the legal issues
2095695 we currently have no plans to announce a ps3 version

2095783 i was 185 when i came to college and i broke my ankle then i moved to defensive end now im about 235 its a pretty big difference in weight in just two years i put it on by just working hard eating a lot
2095784 i played only my senior year mainly at receiver no defense at all
2095785 i realized i had a love for football my senior and i didnt want to stop i worked hard and coach leavitt gave me a chance
2095786 hes done a great job but we havent played a game yet i want big play from him i want him to be a great lineman strong run defense
2095787 hes got a long body long reach he has a good chance to help us
2095788 i always work with special teams its early so its hard to really tell
2095789 hes sore he has a sore back hopefully it is nothing serious
2095790 they did a good job long day we worked them hard really pushed them they responded well we ran them all the way down then lined them up and went we went through critical situation and two minute offense being only the second day in shoulder pads it was pretty impressive
2095791 they get tired and frustrated with frustration comes anger with anger comes conflict that means you have pushing and shoving you learna lot you really dont let it go but at the same time i dont want my hand or nose broken i broke my nose three times playing football i dont want to break it again
2095792 the university of south florida football team has 17 returning starters who know the feeling of winning a bowl game and losing a bowl game that experience could pay dividends as the bulls embark on the 2008 season
2095793 ill put it to you this way you should not be surprised if south florida is undefeated heading to morgantown wv on december 6 the toughest games facing usf before then kansas at home pittsburgh at home louisville and rutgers at home south florida will likely be favored in every contest before they travel to west virginia throw in 17 returning starters and one of the best defenses you give absolutely no credit to and the bulls should be absolutely no surprise but they will be most pre season polls dont have them ranked in their top 20 george selvie is a stud on defense and matt grothe and mike ford should be formiddable on offense this offense could average more than 40 points this year and the defense could give up less than 20 that is a pretty good recipe for success throw in a very unheralded coach in jim leavitt and the bulls are a force to be reckoned with in 2008
2095794 since moving from guard to center to fill in for an injured nick capogna in last years season opener university of south florida senior jake griffin says hes found a home
2095795 i know that im here and that i get to do what i love all because of a higher power
2095796 as a way to give thanks for my blessings its important that whatever events i or my fan club host have a greater purpose than for the fans to just come to see me its important that we all find a way to give back to our global community
2095797 we are humbled by the generosity of the fans they really came through for us
2095798 i popped it like a bubble i like to pop bubbles
2095799 that little bastard do you have any idea how long we worked on that thing
2095800 with me being excommunicated what its done is its taken the message of the project and its put it right out up front because i didnt back down and i stood behind the message the reaction has been that people are more supportive of it than theyve ever been before and we have more people signing up to be in 2010 calendar than this time last year
2095801 another classic tale of the dangers and benefits of drugs
2095802 racheal fell off the pace a little and she had to make a decision whether she was going to stay tough or bail out
2095803 i didnt doubt that racheal was going to fight to the end
2095804 ending on a good note in track always keeps you motivated to succeed during the next season
2095805 im hoping that ending on a good note carries over into cross country
2095806 i think im going to have to up my ante on both the training and leadership roles
2095807 its going to be a different season basically the entire class i came in with is going to be gone and its going to be an adjustment training with the younger girls
2095808 were leaning on her to lead by running hard and performing shes going to run through adversity and run through bad weather she is going to run through whatever obstacles she has to
2095809 i was their host when they came for a visit to the university of iowa
2095810 they saw the success ive had here and they thought this would be a good place for them to succeed as well
2095811 racheals not a real rah rah type of person were leaning on her to lead by running hard and performing shes going to run through adversity and run through bad weather she is going to run through whatever obstacles she has to
2095812 our first priority is to get to nationals as a team
2095813 weve had success there in the past and our no 1 goal should be a return to the national meet
2095814 im more of a long distance runner but i like the 6 kilometer distance in cross country because its over hills and grass
2095815 i think cross country plays into my strengths its more strength training than track
2095816 my mom and i came to visit and the very next day i decided to come here because it is close to home and coach anderson knows what hes doing
2095817 i didnt know anyone when i came here but i really liked the campus and the academics here are very good coach anderson is a friendly guy who shoots it straight how hes going to train you and what hes working toward
2095818 for the first time in her career racheal comes into a season as our leader and our top runner on paper

2095836 let me say something here and if it were not so i simply would not say it
2095837 mike and adelaide united have the same philosophy in its commitment to assisting womens football in this country being successful at a national level and contributing to the overall growth and profile of the womens game in australia
2095838 its a fantastic opportunity to further my career as a coach and also help develop the womens game to a national level
2095839 i can see that the womens game with the progress it has made in the past 12 months with the matildas performance at the world cup is really ready to explode in this country
2095840 there is now a pathway for local players to showcase their talents on a national level so i expect the game to really grow
2095841 the next couple of years are going to be really big for the sport it gives everybody at every club an opportunity to show their wares and i am sure we will unearth some good players around the clubs
2095842 im really happy to be on board as a coach at the club im sure the womens adelaide united team will get the support from the mens side and it will be another south australian side that everyone can get behind

2095850 democratie en de westerse levenswijze deugen niet zuivere islam is de oplossing voor alle problemen
2095851 zie je wel ze hebben wat de tegen de islam en alle moslims
2095852 het volgen van de koran en sunnah volgens het begrip van de salafs
2095853 ook is er een andere opvallende zaak met betrekking tot het selefisme en dat is dat zij uitnodigen naar kennis en dat er vele mogelijkheden zijn om kennis op te doen op universiteiten in arabische landen etc etc
2095854 wat is er mis met de profeet vrede zij met hem en zijn metgezellen moge allaah hen genadig zijn
2095855 het volgen van de koran en sunnah volgens het begrip van de salafs
2095856 de salafs of vrome voorgangers zijn de eerste drie generaties moslims die volgens een hadith rechtgeleid zouden zijn
2095857 wat is er mis met de profeet vrede zij met hem en zijn metgezellen moge allaah hen genadig zijn want kritiek op het selefisme is kritiek op de boodschapper en zijn metgezellen en hun handelingen letterlijk en figuurlijk het fundament van het selefisme is namelijk het zo zuiver mogelijk volgen van de weg van de profeet vrede zij met hem en zijn vrome metgezellen moge allaah hen allen genadig zijn

2095860 niet alleen in libie zie je hoe mensen zich losmaken van al qaida en de oprichters ervan

2095864 fadl was het brein de denktank van de jihad pas later toen ik zijn boek had gelezen begreep ik dat hij meende wat hij schreef
2095865 fadl trekt hier de theologische autoriteit van al qaida in twijffel
2095866 de journalist rasjid rida 1865 1935 wordt als een belangrijke denker binnen het salafisme gezien later was het de onderwijzer hasan al banna die de moslimbroederschap een islamitische welzijnsorganisatie oprichtte en deze gedachten verder verspreidde onder alle lagen van de bevolking
2095867 luister goed jij vuile gek wij blijven hier hahahahahahhahah val dood ik ben een nederlandse moslim en dat zal ik blijven tot mijn dood ik heb medelijden met jouw soort jij moet leven met haat echt triest mijn vader en moeder hebben keihard gewerkt om dit land mede op te bouwen en ik heb niks te maken met wat anderen denken of zeggen jij bent een zielige duivelaanbidder je hebt je ziel verkocht raar wel in de duivel en aanhang geloven en god de almachtige de overheerser van hemelen en aarde ontkennen jouw soort zijn de ergste terroristen jullie terroriseren nu al jaren ons leven hier in nederland maar gelukkig zijn jullie dun bezaaid en zijn de meeste nederlanders ontwikkeld en tolerant jullie zijn hier de allochtonen met allah aan mij zijde vrees ik niks en niemand ik en mijn mede moslims leven jouw soort word verteerd door haat een advies als ik zo vrij mag zijn bekeer je tot de islam en vind rust in je hart haat vreet je op en zorgt ervoor dat je leeg bent in je hart je hebt maar beperkt tijd in dit leven ga leven en genieten het is zo voorbij allemaal wij leven jij probeert iets ongedaan te maken het leven en het lot van anderen te beinvloeden vrijmetselaar hahahaha jij bent niet vrij je bent een slaaf van de duivel je denkt dat je zelf een soort god bent echt zielig ga jezelf na laten kijken als je een man bent met ballen laat dan weten wie je bent laten we in gesprek gaan je kan bij mij altijd terecht voor een gesprek ik weet dat je leeg bent van binnen en dat je soms voelt dat je niet bestaat je wilt gezien worden en gehoord maar je bent gewoon gewoon een grijze muis een miezerig persoontje een van de miljarden die op de aardbol rondlopen maar ik hoor je noodkreet ik hoor je schreeuw naar aandacht ik zal altijd tijd voor je maken ondanks het feit dat ik het druk heb met nederland een mooier schoner en veiliger land te laten worden waar mensen zichzelf kunnen ontwikkellen en in vrijheid en democratie kunnen leven ongeacht kleur afkomst en geloofsovertuiging waar zelfs duivelaanbidders van mij een plekje verdienen want wie ben ik uiteindelijk om te oordelen dat laat ik over aan de rechter der rechters allah a rahman ou raheem mvg bouchra ismaili
2095868 we zijn inderdaad allemaal moslims vertrouw dan ook op de intentie van je broeder zuster als die je aanspreekt op je gedrag of wat dan ook vraag dan naar het waarom en waarop dit gebaseerd is wie weet heeft hij zij wel een goede intentie en wil deze je leiden naar het rechte pad
2095869 het zijn geen intelligente mensen alison het is vluchtgedrag volgens dezelfde mensen mochten wij vroeger in nederland geen moskeen bouwen maar nu ze er zijn bidden ze er wel in
2095870 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
2095871 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months
2095872 the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
2095873 understanding the genetics of complex disorders such as nicotine addiction will require much more research on key traits
2095874 we have done a great deal of analysis on italy who are very strong but they do have weaknesses and i think we can score goals against them

2095878 if your work day is too too full then meet for breakfast this is also a great suggestion for entrepreneurs on limited budgets as breakfast is almost always more affordable than a big business lunch but to pass up the opportunity to share conversation and ideas with clients is a tremendous mistake

2095890 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
2095891 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace
2095892 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems
2095893 obviously were disappointed not to have been at the top but as a brand we consistently rank high in many many quality studies
2095894 improved quality is good for everybody its good for the consumer they dont have the annoyance of problems they dont have the costs associated
2095895 for the manufacturer its obviously good news because they dont have to pay so much in warranty repairs

2096338 singer guitarist andrew stockdale now plans to find other musicians over coming months and to then begin making a new wolfmother album
2096339 wolfmother toured the world virtually non stop through 2006 and early 2007 on the back of their acclaimed self titled debut album longstanding frictions within the group then lead them to take an extended break during the second half of 2007 to consider their future
2096340 andrew stockdale myles heskett and chris ross will make no public statements at this time except to say that they are each really looking forward to making their new music over the years ahead in the meantime they simply ask all wolfmother fans to please understand that in spite of their best efforts over a long period of time they just could not find a harmonious way to work together and that has lead to the decisions announced today
2096341 following that show splendor in the grass chris ross decided to announce that he was leaving the band due to irreconcilable personal and musical differences myles heskett has also decided to leave the band rather than continuing as part of a changed lineup the pair has been working together on songs for some time and they plan to focus their energies on that new project in the future

2096398 launch pad for the emergence of a foundation to promote the alliance of civilisations through in depth comparative study
2096399 in morocco the alliance of civilisations is nothing new it is rooted in our memory our history our traditions national progress and values reflect moroccos ability to favour coming together rather than breaking apart synthesis rather than exclusion alliances rather than clashes
2096400 these chasms arise from political motives and have nothing to do with any impossibility of co existence contrary to the claims of those who support the clash of civilisations

2096442 we have seen first hand what the lack of tummy time can mean for a baby developmental cognitive and organizational skills delays eye tracking problems and behavioral issues to name just some complications
2096443 new parents are told of the importance of babies sleeping on their backs to avoid sids but they are not always informed about the importance of tummy time
2096444 ideally babies should be placed on their tummies after every nap diaper change and feeding starting with 1 2 minutes
2096445 since the early 1990s we have seen a significant decrease in sids cases while simultaneously witnessing an alarming increase in skull deformation
2096446 increasing the amount of time your baby lies on his or her tummy promotes muscle development in the neck and shoulders helps prevent tight neck muscles and the development of flat areas on the back of the babys head and helps build the muscles baby needs to roll sit and crawl
2096447 its important to get our infants out of devices that constrain mobility and onto their tummies so they can focus on neck muscle balance as they interact with their caregivers

2096463 no one really knows yet if and when iran will get the system
2096464 russia will have to think real hard before delivering this system to iran which is possibly on the brink of conflict with either israel or the us since if the system is delivered an ew electronic warfare system will likely be developed to neutralize it and if that happens it would be catastrophic not only for iran but also for russia
2096465 no country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective
2096466 for these reasons russia may not deliver it in the end to iran
2096467 either way we need to keep every option open if they provoke us or they attack us our army is prepared to attack and to succeed uncompromisingly
2096468 its up to us to find the best way to get the best result with minimum damage

2096471 and i saw a great and wondrous sign in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cries travailing in birth and pained to be delivered and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man child who is to rule all the nations and the child was caught up unto god and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath the place prepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days and then when the dragon saw it he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child and to the woman were given two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood and the earth helped the woman and opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the saints of her seed which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus
2096472 saw and persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child and to the woman were given two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent

2096494 there is a broad view by the public that our health care system needs a full overhaul either to be totally rebuilt or reformed
2096495 often paperwork doesnt arrive or your records arent available when you show up there are also concerns about getting timely access to care
2096496 also having a regular doctor who is available to see you getting timely referrals and having more affordable care are important to people
2096497 we now spend twice per capita what other developed nations spend on care yet we die younger have worse access to care and are even behind on medical computerization
2096498 these survey results are a clarion call for the health financing mechanism used elsewhere nonprofit national health insurance
2096499 we have seen the number of uninsured rise we have seen people facing higher out of pocket costs we see layers of complications in terms of billing problems

2096503 anderson did not stop or seize any of the messages that were forwarded to him
2096504 andersons actions did not halt the transmission of the messages to their intended recipients as such under well settled case law as well as a reading of the statute and the ordinary meaning of the word intercept andersons acquisitions of the e mails did not violate the wiretap act
2096505 the information was obtained in a legal manner from a confidential informant who we believe obtained the information legally
2096506 the case is alarming because its implications will reach far beyond a single civil case
2096507 law enforcement officers could engage in the contemporaneous acquisition of e mails just as anderson did without having to comply with the wiretap acts requirements
2096508 internet service providers could intercept and use the private communications of their customers with no concern about liability
2096509 the government could go to your internet service provider and say copy all of your e mail but make the copy a millisecond after the email arrives and it would not be a wiretap

2096596 that film follows a group of childhood friends exploreres who meet up at their 10 year reunion and wind up on a treasure hunting adventure definitely sounds like the perfect goonies sequel if yea know they filmed it when all those guys were in their late 20s not late 30s

2096693 the possession rate now is similar to that of the late 1990s but remains less than half the rate experienced in the early 1990s
2096694 this is not surprising given the greater inherent propensity for default in the adverse credit sector due to borrowers past credit experience
2096695 it is exacerbated by a greater proportion of adverse credit loans being linked to the london interbank offered rate which remains stubbornly high the dramatic reduction in the availability of new adverse credit mortgages has also affected borrowers who might otherwise use remortgaging as a strategy to help manage their payments

2096698 interventions that have been created to encourage abstinence have treated abstinence and sexual activity as opposites however teenagers say they dont think of them as opposites
2096699 these interventions are less likely to work than more comprehensive sex education programs because they are not meeting adolescents where they are and they are speaking a different language
2096700 this paper demonstrates that increasing abstinence intention does not lead to less sex in fact when abstinence intention and sex intention interact with each other a teenager is more likely to have sex
2096701 our findings raise serious concerns about the abstinence only approach as a risk reduction method for adolescent sexual behavior
2096702 the united states has the highest teen pregnancy rate among developing nations and rates of sexually transmitted diseases in this country are high the risks are real and if people want to keep teens safe from the negative outcomes of sex abstinence only programs are not the way to go more comprehensive programs that include abstinence as one choice are much more likely to have the outcomes we want that teenagers eventually will be in a positive and fulfilling sexual relationship

2096704 el se or bayardo arce asesor econ mico de la presidencia dio una apertura y nos pidi que les dij ramos en blanco y negro qu es lo queremos que el gobierno haga ahora vamos a hacerlo y ya quedar en su cancha la pelota una vez que terminemos de elaborar nuestras propuestas
2096705 ahora el asunto es c mo lo vamos a hacer
2096706 es urgente encontrar una salida efectiva a este problema imaginate que si tenemos un d ficit de hasta 500 mil o de 900 mil viviendas dependiendo de la perspectiva desde la cual se vea y anualmente se suman 20 mil viviendas m s que necesita la familia nicarag ense para satisfacer la demanda natural y s lo est s construyendo 5 mil eso significa que por fuerza ya ten s que construir de manera masiva 15 mil m s casas por a o
2096707 en estos momentos definitivamente no ha habido cierres pero las empresas que pertenecemos a la c mara de urbanizadores hemos sentido una baja muy grande m s del 50 por ciento del sector construcci n en este momento est deprimido no hay inversi n
2096708 de la feria anterior a esta feria nosotros hemos tenido una ca da de entre el 60 y 70 por ciento en las ventas es decir si antes estabas vendiendo 10 casas por mes ahora est s vendiendo tres o si estabas vendiendo cinco ahora est s vendiendo solamente dos
2096709 el subsidio en la tasa de inter s es fundamental es una combinaci n conseguir fondos frescos y baratos a nivel internacional que se puedan colocar aqu y conseguir algunos est mulos del gobierno en cuanto a ir en cuanto impuestos que a la banca le permita reducir el costo de inter s esas son las dos condiciones
2096710 la vivienda de inter s social tiene que ser subsidiada por el gobierno el gobierno tiene que aportar de manera que nos permita que venga dinero con intereses m s bajos al obtener intereses m s bajos obviamente la vivienda llega al cliente a un mejor precio el primer gran paso es obtener fondos si no hay fondos no hay proyectos que puedan salir adelante
2096711 es m s dif cil llegar al segmento de la vivienda de inter s social
2096712 por ejemplo hay pendiente una ley sobre el registro p blico si hoy por hoy cuesta inscribir una propiedad si vos le met s dos mil escrituras simult neamente porque necesit s inscribir casas nuevas al registro lo termin s de colapsar

2096715 ive met most of the teams over the last six to nine months and i just try and build up a relationship and if any of the athletes need some words from any of us then i guess our role is to pass on our own experiences in sport

2096718 in previous simulations this region came out smooth but now we have enough detail to see clumps of dark matter
2096719 some of those clumps are so dense they will emit a lot of gamma rays if there is dark matter annihilation and it might easily be detected by glast
2096720 there are several candidate particles for cold dark matter and our predictions for glast depend on the assumed particle type and its properties
2096721 for typical wimps anywhere from a handful to a few dozen clear signals should stand out from the gamma ray background after two years of observations that would be a big discovery for glast
2096722 it simulates the dark matter distribution from near the time of the big bang until the present epoch so practically the entire age of the universe and focuses on resolving the halo around a galaxy like the milky way
2096723 we see a lot of substructure even in the inner part of the halo where the solar system is
2096724 every substructure has its own sub substructure and so on there are lumps on all scales
2096725 we can make comparisons with the dwarf galaxies and stellar streams associated with the milky way the appearance of these stellar systems is closely linked to the substructure of the dark matter halo

2096728 we started thinking theologically about love specifically how gods love for us affects our ability to love in all the ways we use the term from love of ice cream to erotic love
2096729 parks like yosemite are perfect places to illustrate gods extravagant love for all of creation
2096730 its an overwhelming experience particularly for people who have never been out west ive been to glacier and rocky mountain national parks before but when we first entered yosemite valley and pulled over to see half dome in the distance i was literally speechless

2096818 oh he just told me to look out for the japanese when we play them in our next game he says they know how to play with the ball on the ground
2096819 its just pain and i have to play through it
2096820 we saw only a little of the usa japan game
2096821 but we know that theyre going to be tough we know theyre going to play good football very technical but we created a lot of chances against the dutch and if we keep up that kind of playing we should be fine

2096863 these snails have an operculum a door that closes the shell
2096864 they can be out of the water for longer than other snails and when fed to fish they are not digested and sometimes come out alive this has a potential to alter the salmon and trout fisheries because they alter the food chain
2096865 in the western u s this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems
2096866 in our most recent survey we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter
2096867 in lake erie they are not very abundant but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface
2096868 the first is that any introduction of a nonnative species can cause worse problems than they were expected to cure the second is that these flukes have a multiple host life cycle infecting ducks that are apparently not affected before infecting the snails this might work in the west where the snails are in shallow water but no duck is going to dive 100 feet to get snails
2096869 that means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another we advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear or use formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails
2096870 i have frozen them for 12 hours at a time and about 50 percent of them survive

2096876 het is toch een verdedigbaar standpunt dat je sommige dieren te intelligent acht om te doden voor voedsel walvissen apen varkens of slecht te verzorgen of dat je met sommige dieren zoveel empathie hebt dat je voor veel betere leefomstandigheden wilt zorgen

2096891 my favourite indicator is instead house values to disposable income which i used in the mises
2096892 in order to get back within the historical range house prices will have to fall at least 19 relative disposable income and were house prices to fall to the lower end of the historical range then they would fall some 27 relative to disposable income compare this with the mere 9 relative decline from the peak we have seen so far or saw until q1 2008 using the likely q2 2008 numbers more of the needed decline will have been done away with even excluding the temporary boost to disposable income from the tax rebates but even so it is clear that house prices will have to fall a lot more in relative terms to get reasonable and that most of the decline is ahead of us
2096893 we conclude that declines in house prices are highly likely to remain small our analysis reveals unsurprisingly that foreclosures and home prices have negative effects on each other over time but this does not imply a vicious cycle of collapsing prices our models predict that as foreclosures continue to climb in many states house prices will remain flat or decline in those states but will not collapse one reason for this is that the effect of foreclosure shocks on house prices is small furthermore other fundamental factors such as employment growth and a slowing of the growth of the housing supply over the past year and a half will cushion the impact of foreclosures we constructed several forecasting models even under an extreme worst case scenario for foreclosures our conclusion was that u s house prices just arent going to fall by very much in the next two years in our worst case scenario the average cumulative decline is about 5 and only 12 states experience declines greater than 6 by the end of 2009

2096899 washington marketwatch as the economy continues to suffer from the housing downturn and fallout from risky mortgages the federal reserve board on monday voted unanimously to bar lenders from making higher priced mortgages without regard to a consumers ability to repay regarding higher priced loans the feds new rules also prohibit lenders from relying on income or assets that it does not verify to determine repayment ability imposing prepayment penalties if the payment can change during the initial four years and making a loan without establishing an escrow account for property taxes and homeowners insurance for first lien loans
2096900 i swear to god mildred i saw it drive right up out of the water its one of those new models you know
2096901 government interventions directly in housing or mortgage markets are not necessarily the best policy responses
2096902 by allowing markets to sort themselves out quickly a foundation for sustainable homeownership and responsible mortgage lending can be re established
2096903 from an economic standpoint this decline of overvalued properties is necessary
2096904 if house prices are allowed to remain artificially high homebuilders will make the eventual correction even worse by supplying more unneeded houses and driving prices down even further
2096905 in order to ensure the mortgage market functions effectively the lender must have the ability to seize the borrowers property as collateral
2096906 without the possibility of foreclosure mortgage rates would be more on par with those of credit cards
2096907 it is important to keep in mind that there will be those individuals who are truly harmed by the crisis
2096908 the financial distress to borrowers and communities caused by foreclosure should be addressed directly
2096909 falling prices have kept would be buyers from signing off on property as they wait for a better deal
2096910 home buyers should always have a long term view to build wealth
2096911 we expect the housing market to remain largely out of balance for the rest of this year and most of next year as foreclosures add to inventory putting downward pressure on home prices

2097015 the defendant returned from the kitchen with a cigarette which she continued to smoke in the bar area she confirmed it was a smoke free hotel but said it was her home and she was free to smoke

2097019 as having special significance in public school and educational institutions and encourages those entities to conduct suitable commemorative exercises on that date
2097020 this is a desire that bursts forth from the human heart to live in a society patterned on love
2097021 we live in an age of globalization where every idea and every point of view can now be easily spread and shared in the midst of all these voices how can we discover a sure path for progress
2097022 jesus takes some of his closest friends with him on a mountaintop and he begins to shine with glory his face is as dazzling as the sun but it is still his human face who he is as a human being is still present his human nature is still intact his divine nature is powerfully revealed but only by gazing on his human face it is a face we see today in our brothers and sisters and in particular the poor and helpless to build the civilization of love means to seek the face of jesus in others
2097023 the genuine christian knows that god and humanity are not in competition
2097024 our pursuit of a civilization of love does have certain limits it cannot cross we must never do evil even if it seems to be for a greater good
2097025 it must have been tough to keep this secret but it would have taught these disciples an important lesson while extraordinary experiences are good the living ordinary presence of christ is just as important it is not grace or nature it is not jesus or the world yes we must learn to live in an ordinary world but as a beginning not an end
2097026 these will require them to deny the ordinary goodness of this life it because they do not know our secret that the face of god is found reflected in the face of our neighbour this is the secret that makes the civilization of love possible

2097029 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2097030 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2097031 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2097032 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2097033 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2097034 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2097035 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2097036 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system
2097037 la idea era realizar la intervenci n en 2007 cuando iniciamos la campa a en los medios de comunicaci n para captar voluntarias
2097038 no se han presentado m s pacientes porque hay que tener en cuenta que estas mujeres consideran normal la ablaci n

2097056 the olympics begin tomorrow and theyre in china so you know it should be a rather fascinating world event if youre into fascinating world events
2097057 this work helps connect our psychological understanding of why we like some things and not others with the genetic mechanisms that define our range of behaviors
2097058 in the ongoing discussion about how much the environment versus genetics determine behavior this study points to how the interaction between these factors influences our judgment and decision making
2097059 we were surprised to see that variation in the creb1 gene would account for more than 20 percent of the difference in how healthy participants weighed different options and expressed specific preferences
2097060 our previous studies and the work of other groups suggested that variation in this gene could be important for judgment and decision making by the brain but we needed to connect this to a measurable decision making effect in both behavior and brain activity
2097061 this study connects quantitative measurements across three levels of observation brain activity genomic variation and the expression of preference we now are investigating the potential role of other genes and will go on to assess how this relationship across three levels of observation may be affected by conditions such as depression and addiction

2097065 you know what they say a bat in the hand is worth two in the belfry
2097066 it shows that singaporeans are open and that they recognise that women can be leaders and capable and why not
2097067 it suggests endorsement for the position that women are welcomed in positions of higher office it speaks volumes of women already holding positions of influence if they hadnt done well then you wouldnt have this kind of affirmation
2097068 a hotel of sorts which people will leave if greener pastures are available
2097069 it shows that singaporeans are open and that they recognise that women can be leaders and capable and why not
2097070 it suggests endorsement for the position that women are welcomed in positions of higher office it speaks volumes of women already holding positions of influence if they hadnt done well then you wouldnt have this kind of affirmation
2097071 a hotel of sorts which people will leave if greener pastures are available
2097072 certainly we should investigate further and invest more effort in making singapore a place that people are emotionally attached to
2097073 it just makes you really sad to see that the buildings that its just a building but its still a place where theyve had many good times
2097074 shes learned to be independent shes learned to go out in a restaurant and order her food pay for her food and she can even figure what tip she needs to leave so it has meant the world it has been a growing experience for her
2097075 it represents a great loss to me personally also and so im very much saddened you know by it and i hated to see this happen
2097076 all of the sudden when you have your normal routine pattern upset disrupted and that kind of thing well i think that has a tendency to cause some problems but our main objective is to continue the programs that we have
2097077 i know theyre gonna find another facility theyre gonna meet ill even let them meet in my house if they need to

2097079 we hope that the negotiations aimed at bringing about a just lasting and undiluted solution which will protect the rights of the turkish cypriot people their sovereignty and political equality as well as turkeys position as a guarantor power will continue the general said
2097080 our expectation is for intense talks to begin on the 3rd of september the main issues on the cyprus problem are clear
2097081 christofiass announcement that he is ready to share power could be seen as a carrot incentive for the public opinion
2097082 if christofias is hoping to win the support of all political forces in south cyprus and is expecting the turkish cypriot side to help him it means that we face a great difficult situation
2097083 if he christofias has such an intention he is wrong the announcement that christofias and the church have reached an agreement has deeply disturbed us

2097088 his policy of unconditional withdrawal regardless of conditions on the ground could result in renewed violance said mccain who at the end of a long speech distilled his campaigns argument for the white house or more precisely its argument against sen

2097090 the bottom line sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean that much mccain said warning
2097091 its hard to anticipate where we may be six months from now or a year from now or a year and a half from now

2097121 el combustible es actualmente la variable de costes m s importante e incide directamente en la operatividad de los barcos de alta velocidad
2097122 el empleo del tipo de ferries modernos que vamos a incorporar supone extender el tiempo de duraci n del viaje pero a cambio consume menos combustible y permite llevar carga a bordo adem s de tener mucha m s capacidad para pasajeros y veh culos
2097123 las operaciones de alta velocidad est n siendo muy complicadas
2097124 el coste de operaci n de los fast ferries es alt simo y no se puede trasladar al pasajero porque encarecer a demasiado el viaje
2097125 va a resultar muy complicado continuar operando estos barcos en trayectos de m s de 100 millas aunque hasta 50 millas a n podr an funcionar bien
2097126 tenemos un problema de explotaci n con este tipo de buques porque realizan tr ficos estacionales y luego sufren una inactividad prolongada
2097127 tendremos que ir habitu ndonos a los ferries acciona dar un servicio alternativo con buques muy r pidos
2097128 we have the opportunity using evidence based data on community design to create neighborhoods that encourage less car driving benefiting residents health and wallets and shrinking our own carbon footprint
2097129 we expect these results mean that residents find walking more attractive and enjoyable where there are other walkers a variety of destinations easily accessible by foot and pedestrian friendly street networks people want to walk when its pleasant convenient and when there is a destination
2097130 its not how well jump over the obstacles nor how fast you get on the top but how often you stop and appreciate the simple things in life which makes life worthwhile

2097134 the important point to remember is that near term deficits are both temporary and manageable if and only if we keep spending in check the tax burden low and the economy growing
2097135 may be the administrations last summation of its budget and even though it gets to write its own report card the grades are not good
2097136 there is no more striking reminder of the need to reverse the profligate spending that has characterized this administrations fiscal policy
2097137 their failure to address energy prices and entitlement spending coupled with their incessant push for billions in new spending have contributed to this high deficit number
2097138 it is already clear that whoever is elected president in 2008 will face crucial decisions about the path of our nations fiscal policy that go well beyond what may be needed to balance the budget in the short term

2097143 i am very clear that we were victims of a vicious and treacherous small group who were desperate to make rick dieringer the permanent executive director of invest

2097145 how would mr thiede know when questioned mr thiede did not know me never met me and knew nothing about me
2097146 how could someone slander someone else so brutally and defame their character without any knowledge of who they were or whose life they may be ruining
2097147 i was greatly mortified and feel very violated by the action
2097148 my character has been called into question my capacity to lead a non profit is being jeopardized and i have been humiliated and embarrassed in a very public setting the damages to me and my work are incalculable my civil rights have been desecrated
2097149 this kind of behavior has to send up a red flag to the city
2097150 the words that were spoken by mr thiede cannot be retracted

2097161 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
2097162 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
2097163 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly

2097215 black carbon in soot is a major contributor to global warming
2097216 by determining the effects of soot reductions during the olympics on atmospheric heating we can gain much needed insights into the magnitude of future global warming

2097333 minimum purchasing age laws have reduced drinking and driving among teens and saved lives
2097334 statements made by the main source in the news articles reflect ignorance about the years of research comprising the scientific justification for these laws study after study has found that when the drinking age was lowered nighttime fatal crashes for young drivers went up when the drinking age was raised crashes went down almost 30 percent its irresponsible to assert that untested educational programs could alter these results if we allow states to lower the drinking age again more teens will drink and drive and more will die

2097342 the jewish people as a whole will be its own messiah it will attain world domination by the dissolution of other races and by the establishment of a world republic in which everywhere the jews will exercise the privilege of citizenship in this new world order the children of israel will furnish all the leaders without encountering opposition
2097343 according to the primeval jewish view the blood was the seat of the soul
2097344 a tribe which secures its existence with exchange and old trousers and whose uniforms are the long noses
2097345 they stabbed and pierced the body of the young boy simon of trent they have also murdered other children the sun never did shine on a more bloodthirsty and revengeful people as they who imagine to be the people of god and who desire to and think they must murder and crush the heathen jesus christ the almighty preacher from nazareth spoke to the jews ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning
2097346 he martin luther accused them the jews of all those fictitious crimes which had made europe such a hell for them he too claimed that they poisoned the wells used by christians assassinated their christian patients and murdered christian children to procure blood for the passover he called on the princes and rulers to persecute them mercilessly and commanded the preachers to set the mobs on them he declared that if the power were his he would take all the leaders of the jews and tear their tongues out by the roots
2097347 one of the most dangerous jewish qualities is the brutal direct barbaric intolerance a worse tyranny cannot be practiced than that which the jewish clique practices if you try to move against this jewish clique they will without hesitating use brutal methods to overcome you mainly the jew tries to destroy his enemy in the mental area by which he takes his material gain away and undermines his civil existence the vilest of all forms of retaliation the boycott is characteristically jewish
2097348 he who knows the truth and does not speak it truly is a miserable creature
2097349 the jews are a race that hate the gods and mankind their laws are in opposition to those of all mortals they despise what to us is holy their laws condone them in committing acts which horrify us
2097350 if the gentiles non jews knew what we are teaching against them they would kill us
2097351 the jews are called human beings but the non jews are not humans they are beasts
2097352 the akum negro is like a dog yes the scripture teaches to honor the dog more than the akum
2097353 even though god created the non jew they are still animals in human form it is not becoming for a jew to be served by an animal therefore he will be served by animals in human form
2097354 a pregnant non jew is no better than a pregnant animal
2097355 the souls of non jews come from impure spirits and are called pigs
2097356 although the non jew has the same body structure as the jew they compare with the jew like a monkey to a human
2097357 if you eat with a non jew it is the same as eating with a dog
2097358 if a jew has a non jewish servant of maid who dies one should not express sympathy to the jew you should tell to the jew god will replace your loss just as if one of his oxen or asses had died
2097359 sexual intercoms between non jews is like intercourse between animals
2097360 it is permitted to take the body and the life of a non jew
2097361 it is the law to kill anyone who denies the torah talmud sanhedrin 59b the christians belong to the denying ones of the torah talmud
2097362 every jew who spills the blood of the godless non jew is doing the same as making a sacrifice to god
2097363 the jews were now free to indulge in their most fervent fantasies of mass murder of helpless victims
2097364 others were chained to the floor and hot lead poured into their mouths
2097365 pregnant christian women were chained to trees and their babies cut out of their bodies
2097366 thanks to the terrible power of our international banks we have forced the christians into wars without number wars have a special value for jews since christians massacre each other and make more room for us jews wars are the jews harvest the jew banks grow fat on christian wars over 100 million christians have been swept off the face of the earth by wars and the end is not yet
2097367 you are right this reproach of yours which i feel for certain is at the bottom of your anti semitism is only too well justified upon this common ground i am quite willing to shake hands with you and defend you against any accusation of promoting race hatred we jews have erred my friend we have most grievously erred and if there is any truth in our error 3 000 2 000 maybe 100 years ago there is nothing now but falseness and madness a madness which will produce even greater misery and wider anarchy i confess it to you openly and sincerely and with sorrow we who have posed as the saviors of the world we are nothing but the world seducers its destroyers its incinderaries its executioners we who promised to lead you to heaven have finally succeeded in leading you to a new hell there has been no progress least of all moral progress and it is our morality which prohibits all progress and what is worse it stands in the way of every future and natural reconstruction in this ruined world of ours i look at this world and shudder at its ghastliness i shudder all the ore as i know the spiritual authors of all this ghastliness
2097368 further there is a law concerning the slaughter of foreigners who are the same as beasts this slaughter is to be carried out in a lawfully valid manner the ones who do not follow the jewish religious law have to be offered to god as a sacrifice it is to them that psalm 44 22 refers yea for thy sake are we killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter
2097369 this secret of the blood is not know to all the jews but only to the chakam doctors or the rabbis and the scholars who therefore carry the title
2097370 and all of the anxious sighing longing and hope of their hearts is directed to the time when some day they would like to deal with us christians as they dealt with the heathen in persia at the time of esther
2097371 thereafter followed the curses and threats of punishment if i should ever reveal this secret to anyone neither my mother nor my sister nor brothers or future wife but only to one of my future sons who was the most wise eager and most suitable in this way the secret shall be inherited from father to son until the farthest descendant
2097372 dam issardia chynim heroff jsyn prech harbe hossen mashus pohorus
2097373 we therefore beg god to send down the ten plagues upon all the enemies of the jewish religion this means the christians
2097374 thus like the child whose blood has been mixed in the bread and wine may all goyim burn in hell
2097375 what sort of a people is this whose god finds the blood obtained from mutilation of human genital organs as pleasing
2097376 behold i paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised christ shall profit you nothing
2097377 the mode of government which is the most propitious for the full development of the class war is the demagogic regime which is equally favorable to the two fold intrigues of finance and revolution when this struggle is let loose in a violent form the leaders of the masses are kings but money is god the demagogues are the masters of the passions of the mob but the financiers are the master of the demagogues and it is in the last resort the widely spread riches of the country rural property real estate which for as long as they last must pay for the movement when the demagogues prosper amongst the ruins of social and political order and overthrown traditions gold is the only power which counts it is the measure of everything it can do everything and reigns without hindrance in opposition to all countries to the detriment of the city of the nation or of the empire which are finally ruined in doing this do not financiers work against themselves it may be asked in destroying the established order do not they destroy the source of all riches this is perhaps true in the end but whilst states which count their years by human generations are obliged in order to insure their existence to conceive and conduct a far sighted policy in view of a distant future finance which gets its living from what is present and tangible always follows a short sighted policy in view of rapid results and success without troubling itself about the morrows of history
2097378 then the jews in cyrene on the modern tripoli coast of north africa choosing as their leader one andreas slew the romans and greeks and devoured ate their bodies drank the blood clothed themselves in the flayed skins and sawed many in half from the head downwards some they threw to wild beasts and others were compelled to fight in single combat so that in all 220 000 were killed in egypt they did many similar things also in cyprus led by one of them named artemion and there another 240 000 were slain
2097379 hundreds of television viewers and the leaders of several jewish and civil liberties organizations have protested allegations on a popular talk show last week that some jews practice ritual killing of children
2097380 the jews are more subject to diseases of the nervous system than the other races and peoples among which they dwell hysteria and neurasthenia appear to be most frequent some physicians of large experience among the jews have even gone so far as to state that most of them are neurasthenic and hysterical
2097381 idiocy and imbecility are found comparatively more often among jews than among non jews the mongolian type of idiocy is also very frequently observed among jews among the jews the proportion of insane has been observed to be very large jews are more liable to acute psychoses of early age than are non jews
2097382 the guest also said of such practices theres other jewish families across the country
2097383 the woman responded right when i was very young i was forced to participate in that and which i had to sacrifice an infant the guest was repeatedly identified by winfrey as being jewish at one point the woman asserted that jewish ritual sacrifices occurred in other jewish families around the country and that they were known to the police
2097384 may haman and the gentiles non jews be cursed may mordecai and all the jews be blessed
2097385 judaeos quodam festivitatis suae solleni aman ad poenae quondam recordationem incendere et sanctae crucis adsimulatam speciem in contemptu christianae fidei sacrilegumente exurere provinciarum rectores prohibeant ne locis suis fidei nostrae signum immisceant sed ritus suos infra contemptum christianae legis retineant amissuri sine dubio permissa hacenus nisi ab inlicitis temperaverint
2097386 i curse also those who celebrate the festival of the so called mordecai on the first sabbath saturday of the christian fast and who nail haman forsooth to the tree attaching to it the symbol of the cross and burning him along with it while they heap all sorts of imprecations and curses on the christians
2097387 the festival of purim was celebrated on the 14th of adar that is in february or march about the beginning of the christian lent but that festival the date of which is fixed in the jewish calendar does not always fall on a saturday either the author made a mistake or the civil authority obliged the jews to transfer their rejoicing to a sabbath
2097388 it is customary in babylonia and elam for boys to make an effigy resembling haman this they suspend on their roofs four or five days before purim on purim day they erect a bonfire and cast the effigy into its midst while the boys stand round about it jesting and singing and they have a ring suspended in the midst of the fire which ring they hold and wave from one side of the fire to the other
2097389 in every province whithersoever the kings commandment and his decree came there was great mourning among the jews and fasting and weeping and wailing and many lay in sackcloth and ashes
2097390 bad them return answer unto mordecai go gather together all the jews that are present in shushan and fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day i also and my maidens will fast in like manner
2097391 will he even force the queen before me in the house
2097392 people at the present time appoint a new year lord and make merry and this they do because the season which is the beginning of azur or march coincides with the suns entry into aries for on that day they disport themselves and rejoice because the winter is over
2097393 in royal apparel of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and with a robe of fine linen and purple
2097394 behold i paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised christ shall profit you nothing
2097395 the two principal feast days associated with ritual murder have been 1 purim and 2 passover the latter at easter and the former about one month before it

2097399 his story is not that well known anywhere in the world
2097400 i found that during the same period two jerusalem churches and one christian bookshop had been burned to the ground by ultra orthodox jewish fanatics while students from a nearby yeshiva had committed serious vandalism at the dormition abbey there had also been a series of unsuccessful arson attacks on the anglican church in west jerusalem two churches in acre a greek orthodox church in the old city and a protestant chapel in new acre and one other anglican church in ramleh on top of this two russian nuns had been killed by a zealot in a knife attack on their ein karem nunnery while the christian cemetery on mount zion already damaged during the years of jordanian rule had been further desecrated no fewer than eight times had we been jews and our churches been synagogues desecration like this would have caused an international outcry said the monk at the martyrion

2097433 the worst part about taking verbal shots from females is that 98 of them truly dont understand football if youve never played you really dont get it it would be like me ripping on them for watching one life to live something i know nothing about

2097437 not everyone who attends makes money but the real money makers never miss a training
2097438 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
2097439 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
2097440 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
2097441 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome

2097445 pada zaman pemerintahan umar manusia ditimpa kemarau maka seorang lelaki mendatangi kuburan nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan berkata
2097446 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan para nabi sebelum beliau tidak pernah mensyariatkan untuk berdoa kepada malaikat para nabi dan orang shalih serta meminta syafaat dengan perantaraan mereka baik setelah kematian mereka dan juga tatkala mereka gaib yakni mereka tidak berada di hadapan kita walaupun masih hidup pent
2097447 wahai malaikat allah syafaatilah aku di sisi allah mintalah kepada allah agar menolong kami dan memberi rezeki kepada kami atau menunjuki kami
2097448 wahai nabi allah wahai wali allah berdoalah kepada allah untukku mintalah kepada allah agar memaafkanku
2097449 aku adukan kepadamu dosa dosaku atau kekurangan rezekiku atau penguasaan musuh atasku atau aku adukan kepadamu si fulan yang telah menzhalimiku
2097450 aku adalah tamumu aku adalah tetanggamu atau engkau melindungi setiap orang yang meminta perlindungan padamu
2097451 kami mengadu kepadamu atas kemarau pada saat ini atau kuatnya musuh
2097452 penduduk madinah pernah mengalami kemarau yang sangat dahsyat kemudian mereka mengadu kepada aisyah maka dia berkata
2097453 dan atsar ini sanad nya dhaif tidak dapat digunakan sebagai hujjah dikarenakan tiga alasan
2097454 dan riwayat dari aisyah radhiallahu anha tentang membuka lubang kuburan nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam ke arah langit agar hujan turun tidak shahih dan tidak sah sanadnya di antara yang menjelaskan kedustaan atsar ini adalah bahwa selama aisyah hidup rumah tersebut tidak memiliki lubang bahkan keadaannya tetap seperti pada masa rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam yakni sebagiannya diberi atap dan sebagian yang lain terbuka sehingga sinar matahari masuk ke dalam rumah sebagaimana riwayat yang ada dalam shahihain dari aisyah bahwasanya nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam sedang melakukan shalat ashar dan sinar matahari masuk ke kamar beliau sehingga tidak nampak bayangan dikeluarkan oleh bukhari nomor 521 dan muslim nomor 611 kamar tersebut tidak berubah hingga walid bin abdil malik menambahkan kamar kamar itu di masjid rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam sejak saat itu kamar nabi masuk ke dalam masjid kemudian di sekitar kamar aisyah yang di dalamnya terletak kuburan nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dibangun tembok yang tinggi dan sesudah itu dibuatlah lubang sebagai jalan bagi orang yang turun apabila ingin membersihkan
2097455 sungguh aku akan bertabarruk dengan abu hanifah dan aku mendatangi kuburnya di setiap hari yakni beliau berziarah ke kuburnya maka jika aku memiliki hajat aku melakukan shalat dua rakaat dan aku mendatangi kuburannya kemudian aku memohon kepada allah taala agar mengabulkan hajatku di samping kuburannya dan tak lama berselang hajatku pun terkabul
2097456 ali bin maimun memberitakan kepada kami dia berkata aku mendengar asy syafii mengatakan hal itu
2097457 hikayat yang dinukil dari imam syafii bahwa beliau berdoa di samping kuburan abu hanifah merupakan suatu kedustaan yang nyata
2097458 riwayat ini dhaif lemah bahkan bathil karena sesungguhnya umar bin ishaq bin ibrahim tidak dikenal dan tidak pernah disebut dalam kitab kitab yang membahas tentang perawi hadits sedikit pun jika yang dimaksud umar bin ishaq adalah amru bin ishaq bin ibrahim bin hamid as sakan abu muhammad at tunisi maka al khatib telah menyebutkan biografinya dan menyebutkan bahwasanya dia adalah penduduk bukhara yang mendatangi baghdad tahun 341 hijriah dalam rangka hendak berhaji dan beliau al khatib tidak menyebutkan jarh celaan dan tadil rekomendasi atas orang ini dalam kitabnya maka orang ini statusnya majhul hal mustahil jika yang dimaksudkan adalah orang ini karena syaikhnya yakni ali bin maimun wafat pada tahun 247 hijriah berdasarkan pendapat yang paling jauh sehingga kematian keduanya berjarak sekitar 100 tahun maka mustahil dia menjumpai syaikhnya tersebut kesimpulannya riwayat ini dhaif dan tidak ada bukti yang menunjukkan keshahihannya

2097476 it was awesome so much fun the track really suits my style we tried not to be conservative we tried to pull away because the way the points are we have not much to lose
2097477 id sort of envisioned making a move on servia early in the race but it wasnt on
2097478 he was quite a bit slower in race conditions than qualifying so that enabled me to just stay behind him and save a lot of fuel when the pit stop came we didnt need as much fuel as he did and so we got around him it was kind of the same thing with the penskes i got behind helio and ryan saved fuel and jumped them on the pit stop that was the key moment of the race
2097479 running behind a guy like that your front tires go away
2097480 plus i was trying to save fuel so i didnt know whether to try and pass him or play it conservatively
2097481 but my car was very consistent very consistent what happened on that lap was just weird im not sure maybe i caught a gust of wind or something but i braked in the same place and the car just took off
2097482 i got the radio transmission that he castroneves was six seconds behind
2097483 thats a lot on this track with five laps to go i think you saw my laps times slowed by about a second after that
2097484 we were all saving fuel and passing each other back and forth as one or the other would make his numbers and then press a little harder
2097485 they prepared this car in about a week and a half and i gave it a first class effort for our subway with a little more practice and me not sitting on the couch for the last six months maybe we could do better

2097501 we are deeply connected with the mountain our sacred place it is home to our god niyamraja we will not allow the company to mine our land
2097502 we know that obese men tend to have lower psa values than their normal weight counterparts possibly caused by larger blood volumes which dilute the readings
2097503 now we know some of the real implications of this that these men are at a disadvantage in terms of prognosis compared to normal weight men
2097504 we used patient data to examine the association between body mass index or bmi a measure of obesity and the amount of disease discovered after surgery to remove the prostate
2097505 we compared men who had their cancers detected by psa screening to those who had an abnormal digital rectal exam which may not confer the same bias against obese men
2097506 in contrast obese men with abnormal digital rectal exams had similar outcomes as normal weight men
2097507 the aggressiveness of obese mens tumors coupled with the fact that they may be more difficult to remove is like a double whammy for being obese
2097508 the least we can do is find a way to level the playing field when it comes to diagnostic tools
2097509 obesity is very common in the united states so this potentially affects a lot of people
2097510 we cant forget that when we use the term obese we are not just talking about very very large men a man who is 5 foot 9 and weighs 203 pounds would be considered obese
2097511 obama said a couple of days ago says we all should inflate our tires i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it
2097512 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
2097513 as for obamas tire pressure that presupposes that people are a riding around in badly inflated tires as a regular thing
2097514 and thing is one can say that its years from now but that is what weve been saying for years had we been smart 10 years ago we wouldnt be in this fix today
2097515 and b that people have the time to check their tire pressure every day its a stupid nanny state idea which has as it genesis the desperate desire on the left to not increase our energy supplies
2097516 obama said a couple of days ago says we all should inflate our tires i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it
2097517 no one is saying we will drill our way out of this but to put tire pressure in with ocs drilling is stupid period end of story
2097518 ultimately if the majority want to drill then so be it lets drill drill drill ultimately if the people want it and if a politician who is supposed to represent the people doesnt go along with the will of the people they had better get out of the way or they are likely to be steamrolled even if they believe the steam roller is on the road to perdition
2097519 gang of 10 which obama supports calls for increased drilling in the ocs as one of a whole series of measures that on the whole place more emphasis on alternative energy development and conservation
2097520 if leadership is doing what is best for us despite what
2097521 dont tell people just what they want to hear also what they need to hear
2097522 well ok fine lets drill but bear in mind that drilling is not the panacea mccain and the repubs are pretending it to be

2097565 that was a tricky one to be fair i kind of wished that the differences got sorted out but obviously theres the licensing issue for bond even if its something thats already come out
2097566 its incredibly hard to solve because theres so many licence holders involved youve got the guys that own the license to the gaming rights now the guys that have the licence to bond as an ip and there are umpteen licensees
2097567 you have to treat something thats not seen the light of day as a prototype ive had what four or five things that never happened its funny that we dont even talk about them a lot of the time because you think well we might revisit it

2097602 je suis lyonnais je ne veux pas me griller lyon sera au dessus marseille sera tr s comp titif tout comme paris si le psg ne d oit pas une nouvelle fois je maintiens lyon en premi re position et derri re marseille et pourquoi pas nice
2097603 forc ment lyon sera devant a la premi re place je ne sais pas car bordeaux nourrit beaucoup dambitions marseille et paris se sont beaucoup renforc s comme tous les ans dailleurs a nous de jouer les trouble f te comme rennes qui a de beaux moyens aussi
2097604 cest toujours d licat de donner des pronostics quand vous voyez que et le psg ont lutt pour le maintien lan dernier cest assez al atoire mais on verra toujours les m mes en haut de tableau lyon monaco bordeaux nancy ce sont des clubs bien organis s avec un bon potentiel et il y a toujours une quipe qui vient se m ler la lutte mais jai limpression que a nest pas tout fait mon championnat tout a rires
2097605 pour moi a reste lyon le favori apr s il y aura bordeaux ils ont lutt pour le titre jusquau bout lan pass et cette saison ils ont su faire venir les bons joueurs marseille vu leurs recrues ils peuvent aussi se m ler la lutte chaque ann e cest de plus en plus serr a se joue lors de la derni re journ e ce serait bien que a soit encore le cas et pas cinq ou six journ es avant ce serait int ressant que plusieurs quipes puissent jouer le titre
2097606 lyon est hors concours mais des clubs se sont renforc s comme marseille saint etienne ou bordeaux ce sont des clubs qui nont pas perdu norm ment de joueurs et qui se sont bien renforc s a mon avis il y a aussi un outsider qui a bien travaill et qui a vraiment cherch faire une belle quipe cest le psg paris para t avoir mis les moyens pour r unir une quipe qui aille vers les sommets il faudra voir si la mayonnaise va prendre
2097607 je vais dire bordeaux ils nont pas tout chamboul ils ont recrut plus jeune et en qualit aussi comme ils nont pas trop chang ils risquent de repartir fort et comme on sait que le d but de la saison est tr s important a peut faire la diff rence avec lexp rience de la saison derni re je vois bien bordeaux d tr ner lyon
2097608 je dirais que a va se jouer entre lille lyon et bordeaux
2097609 je pense que lyon a encore une bonne marge de manoeuvre qui se r duit au fur et mesure que les saisons passent mais je pense quils ont encore une bonne avance
2097610 bordeaux devant lyon parce que ce sont eux qui ont la meilleure quipe cette saison
2097611 je mettrais encore lyon a cest clair mais je pense quils ne seront pas seuls ils ont commenc souffrir la saison derni re il y aura marseille paris et bordeaux les girondins ont fait une bonne saison lan pass et ils voudront confirmer pour moi le titre se jouera entre ses quatre quipes

2097659 the initial goal for making a sans ii mock up was to learn more about the process from the original fabricator getting a glimpse of what the original work may have looked like was also anticipated yet no one was prepared for the power of the final product especially when the mock up was installed next to the original work at the close of the exhibition the contrast was startling instantly bringing to mind hesses comments about striving towards a really big nothing in her work the mock up was presented by johns during an educational symposium at sfmoma on hesse in the spring of 2002 generating a collective gasp from the moved audience
2097660 swahili culture is divided into sasa roughly the present moment plus or minus a year and zamani everything before that with some overlap as events scroll past living memory they turn from sasa to zamani accruing in the process historical significance as well as story and myth a swahili might therefore find absurd the notion of displaying an artifact in a museum curators might try to display a relic to evoke an aspect of zamani but any object in plain view is experienced as sasa even relatively recent works suffer from this paradox since anything deemed worthy of preservation will have some sort of mythos built around it no matter how short
2097661 who knows but it may be given to us after this life to meet again in the old quarters again the old flags ragged and torn snapping in the wind may face each other and flutter pursuing and pursued while the cries of victory fill a summer day and after the battle then the slain and wounded will arise and all will meet together under the two flags all sound and well and there will be talking and laughter and cheers and all will say did it not seem real was it not as in the old days

2097714 el patio estaba justo frente a la pieza de mi abuela y yo pensaba que a ella que era muy cat lica le encantar a despertarse y verme volando
2097715 pero mi abuela pina hab a muerto hac a 15 a os y yo estaba all con el proyecto de imaginarme c mo ser a mi casa si yo hubiera vivido siempre en chile
2097716 era una poca dif cil y muchos chilenos se estaban yendo del pa s
2097717 mis padres ten an planes de vivir en brasil durante un par de a os pero a los pocos meses de estar all tuvo lugar el golpe militar de augusto pinochet y decidieron no regresar a vivir en chile mientras l estuviera en el poder
2097718 as pasaron 17 a os y cuando se reinstaur la democracia ya ramos tambi n brasile os y nos quedamos en sao paulo
2097719 cuando uno construye una identidad la casa es el primer espacio el punto de partida
2097720 a partir de ah hago otras cosas por ejemplo una instalaci n o un performance que en general se transforman en fotograf as o videos
2097721 la casa de mi abuela siempre me hab a fascinado y empec a trabajar en ella como si fuera un libro
2097722 cada pieza de la casa se transformar en un cap tulo de ese libro que se publicar como parte de mi tesis para una maestr a en po ticas visuales que estoy haciendo en la universidad de sao paulo
2097723 puse un espejo muy grande en el piso y sobre esa instalaci n realic un performance en el que acostada sobre el espejo con un vestido blanco hac a movimientos mientras me fotografiaban desde el techo
2097724 cuando las fotos se invierten el espejo refleja el cielo y es como si yo estuviera volando por el patio
2097725 emocionalmente mi mayor conexi n con este pa s que verdaderamente no conoc a era a trav s de su literatura sobre todo de las novelas inglesas y de las adaptaciones de stas al cine
2097726 me interesaba visitar las casas de algunos escritores como las hermanas bront beatrix potter y en especial virginia woolf cuya obra po ticamente hablando fue la que m s influencia tuvo sobre m por la manera en que se relacionaba con el espacio y con la luz
2097727 tambi n vi una exposici n del cineasta artista y escritor derek jarman y fui a conocer su jard n en dungeness
2097728 a diferencia de la casa de mi abuela que mis primos la mantienen como ella la dej la de osborne est vac a desde hace cinco a os mientras la restauran
2097729 por eso decid entre otras cosas llenarla de sonido para lo que invit a un cantante brit nico que hab a escuchado en sao paulo phil minton que es un gran improvisador y reacciona mucho al espacio donde est
2097730 l cant sin acompa amiento por toda la casa y lo film tambi n lo film a trav s de un espejo de unos 200 a os de antig edad un poco bajo la influencia de lewis carroll en alicia a trav s del espejo que le all en una edici n muy antigua
2097731 la casa estaba llena de cuartos salas y corredores y el espejo era como un camino m s que pod a seguir
2097732 osborne dec a que eligi esa casa porque ten a la mejor vista de inglaterra
2097733 y otro de mis trabajos fue en funci n de ese paisaje tan verde que lo dominaba todo muy diferente al verde a que estoy acostumbrada en brasil con una luz muy diferente
2097734 para destacar ese verde todav a m s compr 50 metros de seda india de color violeta y me tom fotos enrollada en ese tejido como si fuera un tremendo vestido con una cola muy larga que cruza todo el paisaje
2097735 the biggest thing that causes it is usually flying rocks
2097736 if you have a cracked window and youre trying to drive that may cause you to have an accident or run off the road

2097738 on gm and chrysler especially on the front end the impact is driven down to the chassis were told that on fords its driven up through the cab of the truck the windshield really is an integral part in keeping that truck together for your safety
2097739 if youve got broken glass it comes out with a lot of force if it takes that windshield out
2097740 while rational drug design remains a perfectly valid way to develop cancer therapies we also need approaches that are less costly and more productive of new effective treatments
2097741 you could say this is more of a guerrilla approach instead of screening millions of untested compounds for an agent that inhibits or stimulates a particular molecular target we chose to screen a large library of already approved drugs for novel activity against melanoma cells and then advance the most promising candidate rapidly to clinical practice
2097742 our ability to identify novel treatments for melanoma and advance them rapidly into the clinic very much depends on nyus multidisciplinary approach to melanoma care and research
2097743 to be effective translational medicine cannot be unidirectional discovery moves continuously back and forth between the clinic and the bench we are now focused on determining the range of doses to be tested in the clinic whether specific types of melanomas will respond better than others and whether combining mebendazole with other agents will be of further benefit

2097747 you may be surprised at how many terrorists there are in your home right now
2097748 video games computers cell phones teen magazines music tv amp movies all of which fall under the umbrella of entertainment and all are likely perpetrators they can make you take your eye of the ball but they enrich my life and i feel quit happy
2097749 every time we let unsupervised media into our homes and into our kids minds we have invited in a terrorist
2097750 if you let the wrong things in these terrorists will seduce your kids impart harmful values and in doing so inject poison into your kids worldview that could follow them for the rest of their lives

2097752 over the years we have become quite proficient at treating multi drug resistant tuberculosis with initial treatment success rates greater than 90 percent in recent years
2097753 extensively drug resistant cases however are much more difficult to treat and we still lose more of these patients than we save
2097754 these data underscore the critical important of optimal management of cases of multidrug resistant tuberculosis lest they develop into extensively drug resistant tuberculosis

2097765 this administration is going to say we started the effort moving the initiative of moving investment back into americas parks
2097766 the heavy public use areas get the money so the visiting public is generally not aware of the problem
2097767 when it comes to national parks i dont want sound bites i want sound policies

2097772 unless they make a commitment to help with realistic offsets and unless they quit talking about what we can get out of public lands and not what we can put in then its a last minute gesture to what i think is a legacy of ignoring and to some extent starving our public lands

2097781 even if italy is suffering from a more unfavourable situation than germany or france we have every chance of seeing a contraction of about 0 3 percent or more in the whole of the eurozone
2097782 even the german gdp expected next week is likely to show a fall of 0 8 percent
2097783 a full fledged adjustment phase has begun for the euro

2097940 basically we have gone back to 2005 in terms of number of flights
2097941 every airline is looking how to reduce capacity and taking out the most loss making flights but we are fortunate that we had already decided last year to expand very cautiously so our fleet size is stable or some leases are expiring
2097942 had to send two of our aircraft for heavy maintenance checks one after the other
2097943 it always happens when fuel prices go up and or when capacity growth is slowed or reversed and yes it will continue for a while capacity seats recently removed from the market will probably not come right back into the market for a while
2097944 unless the fuel goes down substantially and the airlines go from under recovery to over recovery
2097945 we will be a bigger airline than we were in the winter of 2007

2098242 we have not had that conversation in our conference but i personally would be of the view that we should wait to adjourn that we should complete our work on energy first
2098243 if the democrats want to override us and adjourn they have that capability
2098244 the senate shouldnt adjourn until we have a full debate on finding more american energy and using less
2098245 for the candidates we want them to get home as often as possible
2098246 its always better to be home campaigning town to town and person to person
2098247 but i dont have the power to schedule votes so i am here when i am voting and im at home when im not
2098248 i would always rather be campaigning however we do have to get to work on the gas prices
2098249 thats whats on my constituents minds so being here if we can actually get something done would be a wonderful thing
2098250 id always rather be in maine but i think its really important that were here working on the energy crisis and i personally think that we should not break for the august recess prior to passing a comprehensive energy policy for this country
2098251 the people of maine understand and expect that i should be here working on an energy policy rather than campaigning

2098270 to take steps now such as the inclusion of the low cost and ubiquitously used ethernet interface rj 45 in ce devices to ensure that a cable centric approach to interactive connectivity does not inhibit technological innovation or disadvantage other segments of the video marketplace
2098271 it is not exclusive to cable but is available to any multichannel provider that chooses to implement it on their network and in devices
2098272 while we are supportive of industry led efforts to develop appropriate technical standards we write to emphasize that the mou and the associated tru2way technology represent a proprietary approach developed by and for traditional cable operators and that assumes the existence of traditional cable networks and traditional cable hardware interfaces
2098273 thus the agreement surrounding the mou does not provide a standard that will work for all video providers and instead only serves traditional cable operators
2098274 as intel notes there is wide and growing marketplace acceptance of ip and the commission should ensure that cable centric standards do not frustrate this promising trend
2098275 allow providers to make their own technology selection differentiate their offerings and use different network specific devices to connect to plug and play equipment using a common interface

2098354 bertawassullah kalian dengan kedudukanku sesungguhnya kedudukanku di sisi allah sangat besar
2098355 apabila kalian meminta kepada allah maka mintalah kepada nya dengan kedudukanku sesungguhnya kedudukanku di sisi allah sangat besar
2098356 hadits ini dusta dan tidak terdapat dalam kitab kitab kaum muslimin yang dijadikan pegangan oleh ahlul hadits dan tidak satu pun ulama menyebutkan hadits tersebut padahal kedudukan beliau di sisi allah taala lebih besar dari kemuliaan seluruh nabi dan rasul
2098357 hadits ini batil tidak terdapat dalam kitab kitab hadits hadits ini hanya diriwayatkan oleh sebagian orang yang bodoh terhadap as sunnah
2098358 apabila kamu terbelit suatu urusan maka hendaknya engkau meminta bantuan dengan berdoa kepada ahli kubur
2098359 hadits ini adalah dusta dan diada adakan atas nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam berdasar kesepakatan ahli hadits hadits ini tidak diriwayatkan oleh seorang pun dari para ulama dan tidak ditemukan sama sekali dalam kitab kitab hadits yang terpercaya
2098360 dan di antaranya adalah hadits hadits dusta dan bertentangan dengan ajaran islam yang dipalsukan atas nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam oleh para penyembah berhala dan pengagung kubur yang bertentangan dengan agama dan ajaran beliau shallallahu alaihi wa sallam seperti hadits
2098361 apabila kamu terbelit suatu urusan maka hendaknya engkau meminta bantuan kepada ahli kubur
2098362 seandainya kalian berharap dan optimis walaupun terhadap sebuah batu maka pasti batu itu akan mampu mendatangkan manfaat kepada kalian
2098363 allah adalah zat yang menghidupkan dan mematikan dia maha hidup dan tidak mati ampunilah bibiku fatimah binti asad ajarkanlah padanya hujjahnya dan luaskanlah tempat tinggalnya yang baru dengan hak nabi mu dan hak para nabi sebelumku karena sesungguhnya engkau adalah zat yang maha penyayang
2098364 hadits ini tidak mengandung targhib anjuran untuk melakukan suatu amalan yang ditetapkan syariat dan tidak pula menjelaskan keutamaan amalan yang telah ditetapkan dalam syariat sesungguhnya hadits ini hanya memberitahukan permasalahan seputar boleh atau tidak boleh dan seandainya hadits ini shahih maka isinya menetapkan suatu hukum syari sedangkan kalian para penyanggah pent menjadikannya sebagai salah satu dalil bolehnya tawassul yang diperselisihkan ini maka apabila kalian telah menerima kedhaifan hadits ini maka kalian tidak boleh berdalil dengannya aku tidak bisa membayangkan ada seorang berakal yang akan mendukung kalian untuk memasukkan hadits ini ke dalam bab targhib dan tarhib karena hal ini adalah sikap tidak mau tunduk kepada kebenaran mengatakan sesuatu yang tidak pernah dikemukakan oleh seluruh orang yang berakal sehat
2098365 ya allah sesungguhnya aku meminta kepada mu dengan hak orang orang yang berdoa kepada mu dan aku meminta kepada mu dengan hak perjalananku ini sesungguhnya aku tidaklah keluar dengan sombong dan angkuh tidak pula dengan riya dan sumah aku keluar agar terbebas dari murka mu dan untuk mencari ridlo mu maka aku meminta kepada mu untuk membebaskanku dari api neraka dan mengampuni dosa dosaku karena sesungguhnya tidak ada yang dapat mengampuni dosa kecuali engkau
2098366 sanad hadits ini berisi rentetan para perawi yang lemah yaitu athiyyah adalah al aufi fadlil ibn mirzaq dan al fadl ibnul muwaffiq mereka semua adalah rawi yang dhaif
2098367 adapun perkataan aku meminta kepada mu dengan hak orang orang yang meminta kepada mu diriwayatkan oleh ibnu majah akan tetapi sanad hadits tersebut tidak dapat dijadikan hujjah
2098368 dan apabila hamba hambaku bertanya kepadamu tentang aku maka jawablah bahwasanya aku adalah dekat aku mengabulkan permohonan orang yang berdoa apabila ia memohon kepada ku
2098369 ya tuhan kami berilah kami apa yang telah engkau janjikan kepada kami dengan perantaraan rasul rasul engkau
2098370 kesimpulannya sesungguhnya hadits ini dhaif dari dua jalur periwatannya dan salah satunya lebih berat kedhaifannya daripada yang lain hadits ini telah didhaifkan oleh al bushiriy al mundziri dan para pakar hadits barangsiapa yang menghasankan hadits ini maka sesungguhnya dia salah sangka atau bertasaahul terlalu gampang dalam menilai hadits
2098371 wahai tuhanku aku memohon kepada mu dengan hak muhammad agar engkau mengampuniku
2098372 wahai adam bagaimana engkau mengenal muhammad padahal aku belum menciptakannya
2098373 wahai tuhanku ketika engkau menciptakanku dengan tangan mu dan engkau tiupkan ruh ke dalam diriku aku mengangkat kepalaku maka aku melihat tiang tiang arsy tertuliskan
2098374 aku telah mengampunimu dan sekiranya bukan karena muhammad tidaklah aku menciptakanmu
2098375 shahihul isnad akan tetapi adz dzahabi menyalahkan beliau dengan perkataannya aku berkata bahkan hadits ini maudhu abdurrahman sangat lemah dan abdullah ibn muslim al fahri tidak diketahui jati dirinya
2098376 periwayatan al hakim terhadap hadits ini termasuk yang diingkari oleh para ulama karena sesungguhnya diri beliau sendiri telah berkata dalam kitab al madkhal ilaa marifatish shahih minas saqim
2098377 dan abdurrahman bin zaid bin aslam adalah perawi dhaif lemah dan banyak melakukan kesalahan sebagaimana kesepakatan mereka ahli hadits
2098378 kesimpulannya sesungguhnya hadits ini laa ashla lahu tidak berasal dari nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan tidak salah menghukuminya dengan batil sebagaimana penilaian dua orang al hafizh adz dzahabi dan al asqalani sebagaimana telah dinukil dari keduanya
2098379 rasulullah pernah meminta kemenangan dengan bantuan orang orang melarat dari kaum muhajirin
2098380 menurutku tidaklah benar kalau umayyah ibn abdillah adalah seorang sahabat nabi sehingga hadits di atas adalah hadits yang mursal
2098381 umayyah bukanlah sahabat nabi dan tidak memiliki riwayat yang kuat
2098382 pokok permasalahan dalam hadits tersebut adalah status umayyah tidak terbukti bahwa beliau adalah salah seorang sahabat sehingga status hadits tersebut adalah hadits mursal dhaif
2098383 seandainya hadits ini shahih maka hadits ini semakna dengan hadits umar yaitu umar meminta hujan dengan perantaraan doa al abbas paman nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan hadits orang buta seorang lelaki buta yang meminta kepada nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam untuk mendoakannya kepada allah agar penglihatannya dikembalikan yaitu bertawassul dengan doa orang shalih yang masih hidup pent
2098384 rasulullah pernah meminta kemenangan maksudnya meminta kemenangan dalam peperangan sebagaimana firman allah taala
2098385 jika kalian orang orang musyrikin meminta kemenangan maka telah datang kemenangan kepadamu
2098386 hidupku baik bagi kalian kalian bisa menyampaikan hadits dan akan ada hadits yang disampaikan dari kalian dan kematianku adalah kebaikan bagi kalian amal amal kalian akan dihadapkan kepadaku jika aku melihat kebaikan aku memuji allah karenanya dan jika aku melihat keburukan aku akan memohon ampun kepada allah bagi kalian
2098387 kesimpulannya bahwa hadits ini dhaif dengan seluruh jalur periwayatannya dan yang paling baik dari semua jalur tersebut adalah hadits mursal dari bakr bin abdil muththallib al muzani dan hadits mursal termasuk kategori hadits dhaif menurut para muhaddits adapun hadits dari ibnu masud maka hadits itu khotho salah dan yang terburuk dari beberapa jalan jalur periwayatan hadits ini adalah hadits anas dengan dua jalur periwatannya

2098434 i always had difficulty using the web for list of dorm supplies for college
2098435 but now that keepandshare provides dorm list amp college packing list i think i can do it on my own now
2098436 im going to use dorm packing list and college packing list for freshman dorm essentials when i get to my home computer
2098437 not an easy task finding good websites on the internet let alone for college dorm list
2098438 so i was thrilled when i saw the newly announced dorm list amp college packing list from keepandshare in addition to all their free printable resources now they add this new one

2098442 twenty20 cricket in 2020 does have a certain ring to it
2098443 our strategic objective was to obtain ioc recognition for the benefit of our members
2098444 we achieved this at the first time of asking in december 2007 now that we are in a position to compete for a spot on the olympic programme its only right that we now look at whether cricket and the olympic games would benefit from being reunited
2098445 it doesnt matter where the 2020 olympic games are held but many of us whove experienced international twenty20 cricket and the ipl indian premier league are convinced that cricket should bid to become an olympic sport in time for the games
2098446 take it from someone who has won almost everything cricket has to offer the olympics is the absolute pinnacle in sport
2098447 cricketers wont care about the money the chance to stand on top of the olympic podium to wear an olympic gold medal and the pride of belting out your national anthem would be a life changing experience
2098448 i dont think golf should be an olympic sport to me the olympics were founded on amateur sport guys go in there and train for four years putting their whole lives on the line to win a gold medal
2098449 from a players perspective it would obviously be a fantastic thing to be part of an olympic games
2098450 weve always just watched from the side and seen how special the event is

2098464 vorig jaar vond ik het zon sfeer uitademen van graag willen het was meer een leuke babbelrubriek dit seizoen zie ik echt een groei ten opzichte van vorig jaar ze zijn scherper neem die uitzending over de puttense moordzaak alle hoofdrolspelers waren er inclusief peter r de vries dat was heel sterk wel heb ik nog niet het idee dat het een n tweetje voor hen is knevel en van den brink zijn nog steeds twee aparte persoonlijkheden die af en toe ieder hun eigen programma afdraaien soms stelt de n opeens een vraag tussendoor in plaats van in te spelen op de vorige vraag maar de kwaliteit is er echt op vooruit gegaan
2098465 dit seizoen merk ik aan de vraagstelling dat ze dat geluid meer willen laten horen wat hen onderscheidend maakt ten opzichte van hun voorganger pauw en witteman die uitzending met gerard joling bijvoorbeeld dan vraag ik me echt af wat zon gast daar doet aan de andere kant knevel stelde hem ook vragen over zijn broer die volgens mij voorganger is in een pinkstergemeente
2098466 dat idee hebben ze een beetje overgenomen van barend en van dorp maar ja die hadden jan mulder dat is echt zon querulant maar deze sidekicks vind ik niet sterk je moet f hele goeie hebben f niemand wie ik trouwens wel goed vind is hannie van leeuwen
2098467 ik zou de top van fortis en abn wel eens aan tafel willen zien wat heeft die fusiedrang van hen niet gekost de rente gaat omhoog de aandelen omlaag daar zou ik ze wel eens over willen horen en ik hoop dat ze deze zomer met de olympische spelen niet te veel blijven steken in de sport er zijn meer belangrijke dingen
2098468 ik heb mijn bezoek aan het programma altijd als positief ervaren
2098469 het contact met knevel en van den brink vond ik erg prettig zij zijn oprecht ge nteresseerd en er is dan ook echt sprake van een dialoog ze zijn niet uit op goedkoop succes en willen niet scoren over de rug van een gast dat bespeur ik tegenwoordig in verschillende programmas steeds vaker dan vraag ik me af waarom heb je die gast uitgenodigd als je niet ge nteresseerd bent in die persoon je gebruikt diegene meer als voertuig van je eigen mening of om snel wat inkoppers te maken
2098470 hij heeft een poosje met het bekende vingertje gezwaaid maar dat is al weer zo lang geleden veel mensen hebben dit dan n keer gezien en houden dat beeld vast maar ik ken andries juist als een tolerant man ten opzichte van andersdenkenden
2098471 dat was de tweede keer dat ik op bezoek was en toen vroeg ik me echt af waarom zit hij hier wil men nu ook op de golf van de hype meeliften omdat het aardig is voor de kijkcijfers zulke gasten horen hier toch niet thuis dat heb ik achteraf ook gezegd en ze waren het met me eens dat het wat opportunistisch was ik zou zeggen blijf dichtbij jezelf en nodig niet dat soort mensen uit
2098472 de keuze vond ik niet geweldig bovendien is het wat geforceerd je merkte dat ze iets te krampachtig probeerden een bepaalde rol te vervullen naar mijn mening zijn zij niet nodig
2098473 wat journalistiek niveau betreft vind ik pauw en witteman beter
2098474 maar dat zijn ook zulke topjournalisten het is geen schande als je dat niveau niet haalt bovendien heb ik bij knevel en van den brink tenminste geen kromme tenen als het gaat om vloeken of andere vervelende uitspraken wat ik goed bij hen vind is dat ze niet zo opdringerig zijn neem de discussie over de embryoselectie wat een verschil was dat met nova knevel en van den brink had professor galjaard en nova had professor selderhuis ik vond het schandalig hoe de presentator van nova met zijn gast omging hij ging zo in de aanval en brak de mening van zijn gast af dat vond ik niet kunnen ik zit bovendien helemaal niet te wachten op de mening van de interviewer dat betekent niet dat je geen pittige vragen kunt stellen maar je moet de mensen wel laten uitpraten dat doen knevel en van den brink zonder dat dit verzandt in lange monologen daarbij nodigen ze gasten uit die me meer interesseren wat dat betreft is knevel en van den brink een opluchting
2098475 the olympics are giving china the opportunity to display the beauty and diversity of their culture
2098476 the ambassador consul general is coming from new york city and he could have gone to any number of cities
2098477 i think the olympics are a great symbol across the world
2098478 it shows how we can put our political agenda aside and support one another it shows what the human spirit is capable of doing
2098479 hosting the olympics is a tremendous long term goal of the region

2098553 it was terrible for the families and those who lost their lives but i think that people could see how responsive the government could be and how open they were with the number of deaths and all the information

2098606 sensible one off windfall tax to guarantee social and environmental justice
2098607 the current spike in the price of oil means these companies are receiving unearned and undeserved windfall profits that are damaging to the rest of society not least because the unprecedented price rises are fuelling inflation and therefore the cost of borrowing and repaying mortgages
2098608 its absolutely right that the corporations who are benefiting from that original investment and the later privatisation pay their fair share to society
2098609 where would the windfall tax go if theres another crisis how do we know that this will be hypothecated last time it wasnt
2098610 they could force the energy companies to have social tariffs they chose not to have that line they could instruct them to do a lot more than theyre doing i think they can do this without a windfall tax

2098691 im still very relevant in the game but yeah he did try to make some decisions when it came down to my records being on fire and climbing up the charts and on the radio stations
2098692 he would make a call to the radio station or to the label and say hey this joe record is too hot right now yall need to pull that back and they would oblige

2098704 this kind of dramatic rewiring happens predominantly if not exclusively in early development

2098741 since i was an actress my life was like a open book i thought i would be out of the show in the first week itself
2098742 this is my debut on television as a host since i have experienced the format of the show i feel i can empathise with the housemates and would be able to relate with the participants who will have no connection with the outside world for about 85 days it will be entertaining show with a human touch
2098743 the show would be followed by telecast of half an hour live and unedited slot showing the activities of the participants

2098754 i cant get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology but as you might imagine of course there is more interest out there
2098755 oh absolutely yeah absolutely and the reason we say that is the type of capabilities they have
2098756 with six degrees of freedom you can basically make any movement at all and be able to track that in combination with the sensor bar and other sensors included in the wii remote add the gyroscope capability and you have the ability to work in all three dimensions of space

2098793 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
2098794 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
2098795 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
2098796 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome
2098797 its so easy anyone can do it were looking forward to doing it over and over again

2098814 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2098815 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2098816 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2098817 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2098818 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2098819 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2098820 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2098821 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system

2098837 the retired officers were actively involved in illegal bunkering from their vantage positions in naval operations knowing full well that the proceeds from illegal bunkering is a major source of funding for the operations of militants in the niger delta

2098839 when you are caught discharging fuel or taking fuel from one vessel to another it is also an illegal activity

2098864 one of the most damning charges made against environmentalists is that they destroy the lives of poor people in rainforests and other wild areas by taking over their land in the name of conservation nonsense says new research
2098865 the vast majority of the worlds poor people live in extremely urban areas only a small percentage live in areas that are somewhat or extremely wild

2098875 to compare the number of deaths between the two groups the researchers took into account that accidental deaths are more common for injection drug users and excluded those deaths from their analyses
2098876 an estimated one million persons in the united states are living with hiv aids with approximately one fourth of these cases attributable to injection drug use
2098877 this paper provides important evidence for the value of routinely providing haart therapy to hiv infected injection drug users who need treatment benefiting both the patients and the public at large
2098878 hopefully the findings from this study help address the commonly held assumption that hiv positive injection drug users do not derive the full benefits of hiv treatment
2098879 we have an ethical and human rights imperative to deliver care to this population not only to reduce illness and death but also to possibly reduce the rate of new infections in the community

2098894 theyll say we dont want political pressure so once foreign christians are arrested they release them quickly the next thing you know the whole group is deported out of the country
2098895 they would be arrested they would be in grave danger and those are the cases unfortunately we cant talk about theres tremendous pressure to convert them back to islam
2098896 the saudi king is saying that christians and muslims need to get along better then look at whats happening at home this just shows and exposes the heart of saudi beliefs they can spend money and spin things and they can do pr but what matters is what happens at home
2098897 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation

2098916 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2098917 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2098918 as a result of many hours of shelling from heavy guns the town is practically destroyed
2098919 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2098920 these are the people whose bodies were seen in their yards and in the streets
2098921 this is very sad and this will incur a response
2098922 action may not always bring happiness but there is no happiness without action
2098923 i think probably a lot of good things are going to come out of it and a lot of what you read in here sounds a lot worse than it is
2098924 they then shredded some contact forms clipped some numbers off the consent forms and the next day there was some allegation of shredding and destruction and fraud none of which we believe are true

2098949 my first four years in the army i was in a couple of mos that were phased out
2098950 i decided that i didnt want to go through that again i picked up a copy of soldiers magazine and i read an article about mortuary affairs guys going to vietnam looking for missing soldiers from that war i decided that was what i wanted to do
2098951 you have to have a good mindset because you go to the medical examiners office in richmond va on day two of training they subject you to human remains if you come back from that trip and decide you cant handle it you get re classed into a different mos we usually lose a couple of people per cycle but those who do stay in our field stay for the long haul very few people ets its a very self satisfying job because when you ship a soldier home you know youve done your best to send them home with all honors it gets you in the heart to know youve done your best for a soldier who has given his all for his country
2098952 we inventory everything the soldier had on them and we process them and prepare them for transport
2098953 they go from here to the port mortuary in dover delaware generally we have 48 hours from the time we get them here in bagram to have them prepared before they arrived in delaware

2098966 tale comportamento stato dimostrato da unindagine di altroconsumo i cui risultati sono stati trasmessi allantitrust il 18 aprile scorso
2098967 dallindagine emergeva la mancata attuazione della portabilit gratuita dei mutui da parte del 95 per cento degli operatori bancari che al contrario offrivano la soluzione pi onerosa della sostituzione del mutuo o la surrogazione ma sempre con oneri a carico dei consumatori

2099112 i am greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households
2099113 for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
2099114 the administrator didnt mention anything to the governor about the livestock industry
2099115 however is that the result of the renewable fuels standard mandate our conclusion is no
2099116 and second are those price increases meeting the statutory requirement of severe harm to the economy and our conclusion is no
2099117 instead the misguided corn ethanol mandate is forcing farmers to plow up marginal land and wildlife habitat while increasing global warming and dumping toxic fertilizers and pesticides into our precious water sources
2099118 i am disappointed that the epa missed this opportunity to provide relief for american consumers who are dealing with skyrocketing food prices due to the unintended consequences of the continued escalation of the ethanol mandate
2099119 continue to plan for and meet the fuel and food needs of the future
2099120 every independent study has confirmed that using corn to make this cheap clean american made fuel has no significant impact on food prices

2099188 weve already had payment processors asking us when is the other shoe going to drop

2099190 we also manage their site if they request it we provide all the tracking and all the other bells and whistles that the third party firms offer
2099191 the ipsp is a proven model and an established solution
2099192 but merchants are handcuffed in that model because their recurring billing database is the property of the ipsp its very difficult for them to move secondly the ipsps have such a large negative database to scrub against that its likely good transactions are being scrubbed out based on overkill or the operational flaws of another adult merchant
2099193 its a very robust experienced award winning technology that was privately used in europe before we acquired it
2099194 we think our merchants will realize quickly that their conversions are better with our gateway while maintaining the same level of chargebacks and possibly even lower than what theyve experienced with the ipsps its a wonderful piece of technology that supports adult merchants very well its excellent for subscription category merchants recurring billing merchants and its also good for one off sales it has excellent reporting tools and it gives adult merchants a nice alternative to an ipsp while still enjoying the same features such as live 24 7 billing support and affiliate management tools and we wanted to do it for lower rates
2099195 most competitors in this arena are at 11 to 14 percent
2099196 we can charge much less because as a division of the credit card processing firm global electronic technology get we own our own bank id numbers we issue the merchant id numbers here at get which in turn provide orbitalpay with the risk analysis the underwriting the deployment the technical support and everything needed from the merchant account aspect orbitalpay then enrolls the merchants with all the same features and benefits as get as dan and i own orbitalpay and i own get its all in the family
2099197 were building orbitalpay on the back of an enterprise system thats fairly robust as get is by no means new we have interchange pricing so we dont have to have all the marbles we dont have to do research and development costs because get is established with a staff of about 50 people who are experienced in this business thanks to our affiliation with get we own the actual merchant account and the merchant id numbers which cuts out all the middlemen thats why we believe that in the not too distant future well have a significant market share

2099291 its incredible that now i get the opportunity to i dont know maybe pay r kelly back in some sort of side bar kind of thing
2099292 im still very relevant in the game but yeah he did try to make some decisions when it came down to my records being on fire and climbing up the charts and on the radio stations he felt like they should pull back because he felt he was more important and with their loyalty to him they obliged
2099293 we hear much about god wanting us to care for israel this
2099294 what acid house did was that it made people want to make their own music electronically
2099295 a whole generation of kids grew up into machine music which fueled the rise of music software that we have today
2099296 in the 50s there was a form of rock called skiffle and people built their own instruments with broom handles and a piece of string and stuff like that
2099297 there was a punk rock vibe to it like anyone can do it with only three chords
2099298 then with the rise of music software you dont even have to play an instrument or know what a chord is
2099299 so thats the punk rock and skiffle ethic taken to its logical conclusion
2099300 now whether thats a bad thing or a good thing is to be decided
2099301 the fact that music is demystified and everyone can do it is a good thing
2099302 but the bad thing is that there is a hell of a lot of really bad music around because of it
2099303 are you supposed to employ a soviet art board where you have to present your art to people and they decide whether its good or not
2099304 thats what opened by eyes to electronic music was that everyone can do it
2099305 and that has been going on since the 50s with the birth of rock n roll with people that couldnt play instruments
2099306 you know the first time johnny cash went into the studio i think his guitarist had only three strings on his guitar and he could only play two chords
2099307 now with the rise of electronic music software it has taken it more diy than that
2099308 you dont even have to leave your house or the bedroom its all on your computer
2099309 i think a lot of people get into electronic music because they want fame and money and other people get into it because they are totally driven and are in love with the concept and they cant do anything else
2099310 i think were at the stage where there are so many people treating music as a business that theyll realize they wont make enough money and theyll go on and do something else
2099311 and well be left with the people that have it in their bones and they cant do anything else
2099312 i fall into that category because i am not trying anything else other than music
2099313 i used to do manual labour but i am a bit old now to do that
2099314 i think the business people are going to be weeded out and do something else and the true musicians will carry on until they drop
2099315 i am lucky to have a label that just deals with that for me
2099316 if people want to use my music if its a good film or a good ad then they can take it
2099317 the thought of sitting in a room with advertising executives telling me how my music should sound fills me with great fear and dread
2099318 i think i would end up going nuts if i had to do that
2099319 i havent got the discipline to work on something and make music purely to place it in a film or advert
2099320 i like the idea of that synchronicity where somebody somewhere out there has made a film and ive created my music totally separately
2099321 we didnt know about each other or what we were each doing
2099322 then our artwork a piece of music with a film or advert came together and it worked
2099323 i find that more interesting that sitting down and making a piece of music to go with something tailor made
2099324 we have a lot of two lone swordsmen remixes from the last album that are just sitting there that are really good so there may be a remix album
2099325 next weekend is going to be one of my favourite gigs ill be djing with chuck berry in england

2099332 this discovery is exciting because it allows for a paradigm shift in how researchers can search for a cure for parkinsons disease so far research has focused on ways to get rid of excess alpha synuclein that is built up in the brain of patients with parkinsons now we can look for ways to lower the production of alpha synuclein upfront
2099333 in the middle of this noisy picture of gene expression in blood we were able to uncover a very clear pattern of activity with these four genes
2099334 by recognizing that pattern we then deduced that there must be a switch or mechanism that was responsible for controlling the activity of these genes
2099335 we were able to show that the gata 2 transcription factor directly sticks to the alpha synuclein gene and when gata 2 was knocked down in dopamine cells the levels of alpha synuclein went down as well

2099344 there is nobody in this organization who has even the slightest clue fans should prepare for a repeat of the nineties this team is going nowhere
2099345 also whatever happened to a quick slant and what the heck everyone gets constant pressure but we never try a halfback screen what are we the only nfl team every to not counter the blitz with a screen pass
2099346 this offense can very well be the worst in history it is worse that the raiders from last year it makes you want to throw up watching it

2099514 our research leads us to believe that there are many more children being abused in the name of god than in the name of satan

2099563 we started talking music and before you knew it we would meet up to kick some ideas around dicks piano have some pizza and work on tunes
2099564 we developed a medley of songs with dick and first performed for the wrap party of his tv show diagnosis murder
2099565 we started getting requests to appear at all kinds of events and then dick said he was open to the idea of producing an album i told bryan chadima one of our group to go do a cappella arrangements of all dicks songs now
2099566 its kind of funny bryan is a tenor so we always know what to do with him but dick eric and i are all basses so we have to be creative normally dick is on lead eric is on baritone and im on bass sometimes if eric or i have a melody line the other one sings bass and dick gets whatever note is left if dick is singing bass as he does on lovers question then eric and i are both signing falsetto tenor parts while bryan signs lead confused yet
2099567 while its always a thrill to sing backup for dick imagine how we feel when dick van dyke sings backup for us
2099568 theyre all highly trained musicians and i get such a kick out of working with them

2099792 they are against the ceding of too much power to tsvangirai
2099793 they are also afraid of being punished for human rights abuses

2099818 the thing about the joker thats so good is that while hes an agent of chaos and destruction and claims these are the only two things you can believe in and mocks societys faith in order theres a certain amount of truth to what he says he really manages to get underneath batmans skin to the point where hes questioning his own ethic that he will not kill

2099987 brown carbon spheres in east asian outflow and their optical properties
2099988 because of the large uncertainty we have in the radiative forcing of aerosols there is a corresponding large uncertainty in the degree of radiative forcing overall
2099989 this introduces a large uncertainty in the degree of warming predicted by climate change models
2099990 if we know the optical properties and distribution of all the aerosols over the entire atmosphere then we can produce climate change models that provide more accurate prediction
2099991 the problem with this approach is that it gives the average properties of all aerosol components and at only a few wavelengths of light
2099992 we have used this approach to determine the complete optical properties of individual brown carbon nanoparticles sampled from above the yellow sea during a large international climate change experiment
2099993 this is the first time anyone has determined the complete optical properties of single nanoparticles from the atmosphere
2099994 we show that many of the carbons in our sample have optical properties that are different from those usually assumed in climate models
2099995 when you hear about predictions of future warming or changes in precipitation globally or in specific regions like the southwestern united states the predictions are based on computer model output that is ignoring brown carbon so they are going to tend to be less accurate
