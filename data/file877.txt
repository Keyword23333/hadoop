8770018 we have seen a small improvement in consumer confidence in august but this should not be seen as a turnaround in core sentiment
8770019 the improvement could be down to a number of recent factors which are mostly of short term influence

8770029 it appears that the grape plantings are significantly increasing flood run off from the sloping lands of moderate permeability soils of the southern valleys area doctors creek fairhall gibsons creek tributaries
8770030 this 2008 flood did not cause such damage and this can be put down to the very effective flood control works carried out by the council over the last 25 years despite the increased development in formerly flood prone land
8770031 the roads and their watertables then become cut off channels diverting the stream flows away from their original path and potentially causing flood damage to houses downstream vineyard development has made this problem worse over recent years
8770032 the frustration is that in most cases maintaining tyres properly costs nothing

8770105 i thought that we had a good week of preparation
8770106 its really our first time experiencing how the work week goes tuesday we worked hard wednesday we came out and worked hard two good two hour practices tried to be physical tried to understand were still going to hit as the year goes along
8770107 control the line of scrimmage i think that is what we want to do first our offensive front needs to control the line of scrimmage we need to be able to both run the ball and throw the ball down the field
8770108 there were a couple of weeks there where the defense didnt think things were going real well but as you watch the video you can see it was one guy here and one guy there and some of that was youth i think that our defensive coaches did a nice job of trimming back what we were asking them to do making sure that we run full speed to the ball tackle first and foremost and theyve made great strides in the last week
8770109 no i dont think were looking to make a statement petrino said
8770110 what we want to try and do is get better as the game goes on so that we learn as the game is going on

8770114 as a result we plan to carefully move to a more defensive investment asset allocation to reduce investment earnings volatility
8770115 we have a strong capital position with 105 6 million in excess capital above our internal target and an un geared balance sheet enabling us to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities as they arise and undertake capital management initiatives

8770132 when i was a young scientist the big problems were in human health especially cancer
8770133 now the focus has changed science is now about the health of the planet its an even more severe problem because we dont get a second chance thats where i want to be playing
8770134 the fact is that i have agreed with president bush far more than i have disagreed
8770135 the main thing is to get what you can when you can right now in the hop world
8770136 craft is a real small total a small boat in the ocean
8770137 if hes telling me that hes not just trying to sell hops
8770138 were not in a position to help anybody out but were seeing other brewers do it
8770139 its like charitable giving thats a beautiful thing and nobodys having to wipe out their hop supply to help out
8770140 i cant see breweries withering on the vine and disappearing in the wake of this supply and demand will still hold true
8770141 i can see it getting worse before it gets better but i dont really view that as the glass being half empty its a challenge but brewing is a challenge every day
8770142 people are turning toward the more flavorful beers and theyll still be able to get them
8770143 at this point in time its basically half empty and a hard one to call
8770144 consumers should take heart and try to work through this period with the brewers
8770145 sometimes when i reflect back on all the beer i drink i feel ashamed
8770146 even though they are so close to it their views may be so different
8770147 but for the most part we have gotten a lot of support which we are happy about
8770148 c sar has always meant a lot to a lot of working people all over the country particularly those who are struggling to make ends meet
8770149 we are doing the same things basically hitting the pavement and contacting people around dallas and making them aware of this issue
8770150 we are changing the history of dallas and that is my biggest gripe biggest complaint that they are changing the history of dallas

8770168 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8770169 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the north pole area right now is covered with very thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8770170 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8770171 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the arctic ocean in summer by 2030 or so

8770193 citizens are sending a loud and clear message to politicians and carmakers to shift fuel efficiency up a gear
8770194 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses
8770195 this is the ultimate goal to be one of the brewers of the year
8770196 there are so many great breweries and beers in this country
8770197 to be able to win multiple awards at this competition and be the best of the best is something you cant count on you have to be diligent in your work take a lot of pride in your work and just be lucky
8770198 i try not to use too many different specialty hops and specialty malts in the beer
8770199 you can have a fantastic beer on tap but by putting it in the bottle it can really affect the beer if it is not done properly
8770200 we westerners are healthy and fit unlike you lazy slovenly southerners
8770201 i believe montana is going to be the poster child for developing a crop like this because of the great support from helena and the industry at large
8770202 first of all for montana growers it is another alternative to their crop production and will help them maximize their profits for montana itself it creates an entire new industry for the nation its pretty clear i think that anything we can do to improve our ability to produce fuel at home in a sustainable way is good for the country
8770203 one of the reasons camelina fits in so well is because it is targeted at areas that are not already large native carbon sinks
8770204 the 19 companies participating in this mission represent the cutting edge of us innovation which can boost the efforts of china and india to meet their massive energy demands while improving the environment
8770205 we are bringing some of the most exciting technologies to two of the most dynamic economies in the world
8770206 to ensure energy security drive economic growth and address climate change through industry led solutions
8770207 a windfall tax on the huge profits of energy companies
8770208 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment
8770209 after these first couple of plants come online i believe we will be cash flow positive
8770210 in the case of geothermal the execution of that plan is all in our hands
8770211 the licensing side of our business requires convincing some other company to take the technology and deploy it into their marketplace and thats a lot harder to predict
8770212 geothermal usually takes much longer to be built weve tried to go with an off the shelf type of plant design
8770213 that allows us to exploit sites that frankly were passed over or thought to not be useful 25 or 30 years ago
8770214 we are going back through and tying up a lot of those opportunities
8770215 were seeing a lot of utilities recognize that geothermal is much more competitive than natural gas and has zero fuel risk exposure
8770216 we are looking at the current shift towards fuel efficient cars in the united states as a structural change in demand
8770217 we intend to respond quickly and flexibly to this environment
8770218 for the last few months the company began to say its previous target was impossible and theyve scaled back gradually so everybodys used to the idea
8770219 were proud of what weve done on our environmental leadership the things weve done around renewables and the things were doing to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions
8770220 so in one respect weve got a very positive story to tell and we dont have a problem it wherever we can do so
8770221 i think since thats happened youve seen a sea change in terms of the industry and frankly a lot of the regulators approach to coal plants
8770222 while everyones trying to determine whether capture and sequestration will be feasible and economical
8770223 i think it lends to credence to the arguments that weve been making that these are risky investments
8770224 and that shareholders deserve to be notified of the fact that because these are riskier investments regulators in the future may not want to pass those higher costs on to consumers meaning shareholders would be on the hook for them
8770225 youve seen a sea change in terms of the industry and frankly a lot of the regulators approach to coal plants
8770226 it remains to be seen what the reaction is to any risk level with the investment

8770237 preventing deforestation promoting afforestation reforestation and stopping peatland destruction are some of the cheapest and most effective ways of reducing global greenhouse gas ghg emissions
8770238 we propose the introduction of market mechanisms that can ensure investment is directed into these areas and a strategy to make this happen as quickly as possible
8770239 the prevention of deforestation and peatland destruction requires no technological development and little capital investment this method of reducing ghg emissions is dramatically cheaper than all other mitigation technologies currently available as low as us 0 1 per tonne of co2
8770240 the economics is startling if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on biofuel subsidies us 15 billion this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change in addition to this the protection of these habitats yields a plethora of valuable eco system services particularly in the poorest countries
8770241 one of the lowest hanging fruits of climate change mitigation

8770268 it appears that the grape plantings are significantly increasing flood run off from the sloping lands of moderate permeability soils of the southern valleys area doctors creek fairhall gibsons creek tributaries
8770269 this 2008 flood did not cause such damage and this can be put down to the very effective flood control works carried out by the council over the last 25 years despite the increased development in formerly flood prone land
8770270 the roads and their watertables then become cut off channels diverting the stream flows away from their original path and potentially causing flood damage to houses downstream vineyard development has made this problem worse over recent years

8770299 our farmers are currently subsidising them to the tune of 30c kgms and this goes straight to their profit line and in many cases straight back to their overseas owners weve always said we welcome competition as long as its on an even playing field we compete for milk overseas but we certainly arent subsidised by other local companies

8770309 delivered in an almost conversational tone this is an unsettling and skilled work that raises important questions about the process of dying and what caring well for the dying requires is the etiquette of death yet to be devised and ought there to be one we sometimes behave differently with those facing death perhaps being economical with the truth orplacating at every turn maybe something in us alters or we lower our standards when it comes to caring for the terminally ill do we create new rules for ourselves and is this kindness or cowardice the spare room doesnt shirk from such awful enquiries
8770310 the book itself is a little beauty nice to hold with beautiful end papers and a silk marker to hold your place a most appealing feature of this novel is the elegance and taut style of the narrative voice as she gives expression to large and small questions friendship death tolerance truthfulness and the work of the day the authentic down under voice sustains the work through thoughtful and dialogue sequences
8770311 i loved the embeddedness of this book within melbourne suburbia and her confidential and warm tone like a good satisfying talk with an old friend
8770312 susan hill suggested i read this one and also told me to look carefully at the very clever ending which i did and yes how very clever it is i wont divulge because then you can watch out for it too its more about style than plot but such a clever way for a writer to preserve for posterity a moment of utter guilt trapped like the insect in the amber regardless of what may happen next nothing will assuage helens agony over her decision one that tests her innermost feelings about the bonds of friendship to the very limits and helen garner has captured it with utter precision
8770313 in the few hours i was reading it i learnt more about the psychological effects of a terminal diagnosis on the patient and on his or her carer than i have in some years as a doctor it s such a human piece of writing and so full of affection and humour

8770317 they all sit down before it rains and huddle together in a circle formation during blizzards but from a cows point of view thats just sensible
8770318 if he said to us i want this guy and hes 30m can i buy him the answer is yes absolutely yes
8770319 absolutely not we want to win and win badly but ars ne believes in creating teams the way he does theres a dual problem for him if we were to buy names you are talking about relatively mature players who need to be integrated into the way ars ne plays they dont know our style and it also impacts on the youngsters whove been brought through
8770320 i think it is time we won something again but only one club can win the champions league and one can win the premiership we were close as you possibly can be last year we are optimistic this year
8770321 william showed what a great player he is against fc twente
8770322 everyone has bad times last season at birmingham i made a big mistake by conceding the injury time penalty that led to the equaliser that was my thing everyone is behind william
8770323 the big thing is to feel that you are wanted by your club manager team mates and the fans
8770324 you may have heard a little something about a radio show being broadcast live from our very own hq well we figured it would be a lot more fun if we invited some tallica fans to come hang with us and low and behold one thing led to another and foo fighters dave grohl and taylor hawkins actually said yes so on thursday september 4 were going to hang out play tracks from death magnetic and chat with dave and taylor

8770329 it allows you to let loose and be whoever you want to be

8770337 we are making a down payment on the fulfillment of that dream
8770338 we proved that a dream still burns in the heart of every american
8770339 on this day exactly 45 years ago my father stood on the national mall in the shadow of abraham lincoln and proclaimed i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8770340 let us give our nation a leader who has heard this clarion call and will help us achieve the change
8770341 it is a fact john mccain has voted with george bush and his policies 95 percent of the time over the past year john mccain is not a maverick john mccain is a yes man
8770342 like george bush john mccain suggests spending 10 million in iraq barack obama and joe biden believe we ought to bring the war in iraq to a responsible end
8770343 barack obama and joe biden know that this is not just about turning red states blue its about turning our country around we cannot afford four more years of the same
8770344 hes also going to talk about the difference between him and john mccain barack wants to bring change to washington and john mccain just wants more of the same he will lay that out in specific terms what that means

8770368 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army

8770370 if my guesses are confirmed then the suspicion is raised that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8770371 i think that those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8770372 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8770373 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8770374 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8770375 what were supposed to let ourselves be killed and for that they will say leave us in the g 8 and who will remain in the g 8 when were all killed
8770376 there seems to be little difference between the two regimens the only advantage found in this comparison goes to clopidogrel which conferred a slightly lower risk for major hemorrhagic stroke than did aspirin plus extended release dipyridamole

8770383 when you are part of a family that comes up with a concept sometimes youre the last to admit that it needs to be changed
8770384 thats just crazy maybe they should start calling it the 99 cents and up store
8770385 we try to keep our prices as low as possible
8770386 not based on having every single variety of every product out there
8770387 some relief on the 99 cent price point will provide more stability for their business
8770388 whats the point why not sell a standard size and price it accordingly
8770389 the way weve felt for the last week weve kind of been sitting around waiting for something to happen instead of making something happen hopefully this is the day we get jumpstarted to get ourselves going
8770390 weve been stale we havent been able to get the big hit havent been able to make the pitch it just seems like everything that could possibly go wrong has gone wrong hopefully this turns it around
8770391 it gave us some life when g hit that home run we felt like we were going to win the game
8770392 we have to take it one day at a time not worry about whos playing or whos doing what you dont really want to get into thinking too much about the big picture if we take care of what we have to do thats the best favor we can do ourselves
8770393 thats a great win for us its a game that we felt we had to win
8770394 sen lieberman if hes selected will go to the republican convention and maybe he can persuade them and open their minds on a series of issues like pay equity and choice the many progressive issues hes fought hard for over many years and if he does that that would be a public service
8770395 im dubious about his ability to do that and i think that sen mccain will then have to explain to his supporters why he selected a nominee who if he had to become president didnt subscribe to 80 of his positions
8770396 the alternative is that sen lieberman will have to explain why hes willing to abandon all his principles to become the nominee so i think theyre going to have a busy week one way or the other if hes the nominee
8770397 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way
8770398 i had been telling my story for years and believed it to be true
8770399 sen mccain has always been sensitive to national crisis in the 2000 race he postponed his announcement because of the situation in the balkans we are monitoring the situation very closely
8770400 most people understand that we can walk and chew gum at the same time its in minnesota if it were in new orleans i can understand why it might be delayed
8770401 theres too much time and money and energy tied up into it
8770402 only the toughest partisan would criticize a convention for going on as scheduled its not like people can change a hurricane maybe they should put pat robertson to work to pray it away
8770403 i think that theyre mentioning this to show respect for katrina but have no intention of actually doing it
8770404 it would be an extraordinary thing to delay the convention
8770405 these are very very highly detailed orchestrated events and once they come apart they would be very difficult to put back together
8770406 there is some immediate political advantage to saying that a crisis is upon us and as the presumptive republican nominee i want to demonstrate a laserlike focus on that crisis
8770407 it is extraordinary for us to beat the broadcast networks
8770408 this signifies what people have known all along about where to get news
8770409 theres reason to believe the democrats have been catching up
8770410 i dont know if theyll achieve parity this year but theyll surely be better than they were in 2004

8770435 meu curta deve estender uma ponte entre o primeiro filme e o ltimo
8770436 it wont make much of a difference to struggling american families who john mccain chooses to be the next dick cheney if he continues to insist on being the next george bush

8770439 it has been made from a better quality more durable material than that used the last time the face was replaced in the 1970s so it should last for many decades to come
8770440 it comes from a chariot and it shows something of the contacts these people had and their aspirations i suppose
8770441 the chariot was the flashy run around of the period
8770442 the coins were essentially bribes or gifts to keep the locals from causing trouble
8770443 its middle america these are voters who will determine the next president theyre unhappy with bush and the economy but they dont identify with obama at least not so far
8770444 people are going to make a decision based on those two individuals
8770445 its the sound of the police you hou its the sound that i miss you hou
8770446 no congolese has no responsibility into whats going on in congo
8770447 because we the congolese we want peace we are tired of this foreign sponsored war and instability
8770448 the air conditioner guys are getting their jobs back they sweat so we stay cool
8770449 youre free but your shadow is chaos and it will always be there by your side
8770450 reflected my flat mate when we discussed the movie anarchy and freedom still cohabitate in congo definitely
8770451 ill gun your sorry ass down if you touch fifi my pet gorilla
8770452 as they wished decision witheld they decided that i neednt to bother they liked me too much
8770453 but you said you are belgian it is your belgians who have brought this rule here
8770454 fast and easy money but they are so on the edge of not maintaining their current demand its a disaster in the making
8770455 the best vacation i ever had was a boat trip on the congo river
8770456 an american once told me that was three years ago in mozambique in a five star beach resort i was on the un payroll i had escaped the peacekeeping mission on rnr while he was on a reconnaissance trip for his multi millionaire clients
8770457 our six planned boat trips on the congo river are fully booked for 2007
8770458 says the belgium of his wealthy eco tourists congos paths have definitely become unbeaten
8770459 where we are today based on the landfall projections made today were not anticipating that they would have to make any changes to the game
8770460 but again i want to emphasize that our first concerns will have to be our peoples safety
8770461 if you see contraflow time changes if you see evacuation plan changes because of changes in the storms tracking pattern or intensity certainly that could be changed tomorrow
8770462 but as we stand here today from talking to lsu neither lsu nor the state at this point sees the need to make a change that could change by tomorrow but it may not change tomorrow
8770463 my decision to play here this week has been taken in many different ways
8770464 this was a personal decision to be here and a decision which really after missing the cut last week didnt leave me many other options

8770502 recently approved pesticides have been implicated in massive bee die offs and are the focus of increasing scientific scrutiny
8770503 epa should be evaluating the risks to bees before approving new pesticides but now refuses to tell the public what it knows pesticide restrictions might be at the heart of the solution to this growing crisis so why hide the information they should be using to make those decisions
8770504 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8770505 they needed a short victorious war and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8770506 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it just sounds not rational
8770507 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8770508 doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8770509 we are in the process of reevaluating our relationship with russia
8770510 i dont think theres anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8770511 the humanitarian needs of conflict victims and those displaced by recent violence in georgia
8770512 i dont think anyone should be looking for a new cold war
8770513 what we would like to see is the return to the status quo before august 7th and the hostilities began before russia invaded georgia before the disproportional response to the regular flare ups that happen in the summertime out in that area
8770514 computers used to take up entire buildings now they just take up our entire lives
8770515 so how do you know what is the right path to choose to get the result that you desire and the honest answer is this you wont and accepting that greatly eases the anxiety of your life experience

8770521 i called home immediately to my mom in arlington wa and asked what she was thinking

8770523 biden was humble he was tender and he took the wood to sen mccain just like he was supposed to
8770524 but ive been able to actually get some work done too
8770525 some of the drama has been taken out of the convention in the past 40 to 50 years so it really becomes an opportunity to get grassroots activists excited so doing these issues forums around the convention i think is a new approach to use these conventions to educate folks on issues facing the country
8770526 i dont want to vote for a rock star i want somebody who is going to take care of the issues

8770561 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8770562 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8770563 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8770564 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8770565 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza

8770591 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8770592 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8770593 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8770594 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

8770596 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8770597 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

8770600 obama dovr ricostruire il sogno americano e restituire allamerica il suo prestigio nel mondo
8770601 tutto quello che ho imparato nei miei otto anni da presidente e tutto il lavoro che ho fatto da allora in america e nel resto del mondo mi hanno convinto che barack luomo giusto per questo lavoro
8770602 sedici anni fa mi avete dato lonore di guidare il nostro partito alla vittoria e guidare la nazione in una nuova era di pace e prosperit insieme abbiamo battuto i repubblicani in una campagna dura nella quale venivo attaccato perch troppo giovane e inesperto per essere il comandante supremo delle forze armate vi ricorda qualcosa nel 1992 non ha funzionato perch noi eravamo dalla parte giusta della storia e non funzioner neppure nel 2008 perch anche obama dalla parte giusta della storia
8770603 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate
8770604 il mio candidato non ha vinto ha voluto sottolineare ma sono orgoglioso della sua campagna elettorale e di tutta la gente che lha sostenuta hillary far di tutto per appoggiare obama e cos siamo in due anzi siamo 18 milioni
8770605 voglio che tutti sappiano che sono orgoglioso di avere joe biden e tutta la sua famiglia al mio fianco per riprenderci lamerica
8770606 hillary marted ha conquistato tutti e con bill avete visto cosa accade quando un presidente mette la gente al primo posto ci riprenderemo lamerica perch sono le persone normali a fare cose straordinarie
8770607 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

8770616 da tempo ludc aveva posto lattenzione sulle aree agricole e sul censimento delle stesse
8770617 e stata necessaria la violenza su i due turisti olandesi per capire che a roma sono centinaia le strutture ex agricole abbandonate e occupate da clandestini e da persone senza fissa dimora
8770618 da anni le organizzazioni agricole chiedono di affrontare questo problema continua ciocchetti unidea dare la possibilit ai proprietari di poter farne un utilizzo produttivo cedendo al comune una parte di queste strutture per utilizzi sociali
8770619 nel programma presentato durante la campagna elettorale per sindaco tutto questo era stato menzionato e affrontato
8770620 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8770621 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8770622 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8770623 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8770624 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8770625 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8770626 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8770627 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8770628 who are open to doing something on the production side
8770629 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8770630 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8770631 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8770632 in the middle is a sweet tired town of roughly 35 000 people three quarters of them latino and more than half considered low income under
8770633 youve got a governor who has raised more special interest contributions than any politician in california history and is holding five and six figure fundraisers across the street from the capitol and hes criticizing people who are trying to thwart his political agenda
8770634 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8770635 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8770636 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8770637 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8770638 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8770639 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8770640 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8770641 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8770642 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8770643 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8770644 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8770645 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8770646 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8770647 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8770648 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8770649 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8770650 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8770651 como um comandante em chefe eu nunca hesitarei em defender esta na o
8770652 enviarei nossas tropas para arriscar suas vidas apenas para uma miss o clara e com o compromisso sagrado de lhes fornecer o equipamento de que necessitam para lutar e o cuidado e benef cios que merecem quando voltarem para casa
8770653 esse momento essa elei o nossa chance de manter vivo no s culo 21 o sonho americano n s enfrentamos um desses momentos definidores um momento em que nossa na o est em guerra nossa economia est em turbul ncia e o sonho americano foi amea ado mais uma vez

8770657 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8770658 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8770659 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8770660 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8770661 sexy twinkle in her eye and a british stiff upper lip
8770662 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8770663 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8770664 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8770665 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8770666 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8770667 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8770668 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8770669 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8770670 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8770671 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8770672 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

8770679 the government must not hastily push through the passage of the bill malaysian medical resources all rights reserved
8770680 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8770681 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8770682 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8770683 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8770684 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8770685 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8770686 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

8770701 they made a survey of clients within the first 30 days 95 percent were already on windows

8770709 the u s military went into iraq with few troops able to speak arabic now they can use their ipods to do the talking for them a new software product vcommunicator mobile and a speaker than plugs into where the ear buds go enables troops to quickly access a library of phrases there is also a set of protective covers for the ipod and speaker with velcro straps so that you can attach both to your arm
8770710 if all this sounds very soldier friendly thats because the product was designed with the help of troops from the 10th mountain division who have been using 260 of these specially equipped ipods for the last year this cost the army 800 000 and included language modules for iraqi arabic its a distinct dialect and kurdish an indo european language spoken in the north there are also modules for languages spoken in afghanistan dari and pushto over 700 troops are using the device in iraq and afghanistan
8770711 the army has also provided a solar recharger for the ipods of troops spending a lot of time out in the hills of afghanistan

8770716 we are confident this will be a great convenience for customers who previously opted to take their higher balance deposits to more than one bank in order to guarantee that their funds were fully fdic insured
8770717 through cdars customers can now deal solely with their primary bank and theyll have the security of knowing that their cd deposits are fully insured at much higher limits
8770718 in short it will be much easier for depositors with greater balances to manage their accounts

8770741 i think there is a balance but at every political convention there are celebrities that come
8770742 an opportunity for 80 000 people who might otherwise not have been able to participate to get involved
8770743 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way
8770744 im very much hoping i wont have to cut them off today
8770745 people who go to our shows get really amped but they had nowhere to get plugged in
8770746 when they hear our music we want people to start thinking dialoging and talking about what is going on in our country
8770747 nobody in this band could do this if it werent for a bigger reason
8770748 ever since that moment ive had it in my head i dont ever want to abdicate responsibility in terms of changing the world
8770749 i think this is the biggest demonstration of the week
8770750 this is the most victorious ending i couldve ever imagined
8770751 to date no lawsuits have been filed against united artists or mr cruise nor have any allegations been made of any involvement of mr cruise in this incident
8770752 all press reports and comments to the press stating otherwise and designed to generate sensational headlines are false
8770753 please tell us what injuries your client suffered with necessary evidence from a doctor we would then make proposals for compensation
8770754 mr cruise ms wagner and united artists entertainment did not exercise reasonable care to select a reasonably competent experienced careful and properly equipped contractor
8770755 this is senator mccains decision and his announcement and we all want to be respectful of his desire to have the chance to announce it himself
8770756 hes running against the war running against washington in the primary he positioned himself against the clinton years but thats not what the general election is about the general election will be about changing washington not changing the democratic party
8770757 i think this is going to be a centrist democratic administration its going to be an administration that will end up governing from the center on a range of issues
8770758 im happy with his policy i think barack obama tends to be a moderate hes a moderate by his instinct hes a bring people together
8770759 obamas message has been one of unity inclusiveness and coming together there have been plenty of efforts to throw him off course but hes sticking to it
8770760 politically speaking i think obama would like to have the party in a place that is very close to where clinton had the party
8770761 yet i do believe that after the experiences with bush and the war that the people that make up the majority of the democratic party are a little to the left of center
8770762 i think its found its way back to a progressive center
8770763 part of the fight weve been part of the last eight years is trying to get a party that after 9 11 was very timid to stand up and fight you see more new leaders who are confident and willing to be bold
8770764 i think obama brings two new things to the table and theyre not entirely unrelated
8770765 the first is a promise of a generational transition and hes been absolutely frank and explicit about this from the beginning the second is a somewhat less polarized style of politics in washington
8770766 that rewrites who the electorate is in a very important way
8770767 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8770768 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8770769 it is why i stand here tonight because for 232 years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8770770 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8770771 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8770772 republicans want 4 more years when they should get 10 to 20
8770773 obama is a big fat nothing and the democrats and the american people know it
8770774 obama you suck get your demogogic kicks somewhere history dude
8770775 a mile high on himself and an inch deep in substance
8770776 i cant wait to hear mccains acceptance speech i have been having trouble sleeping lately
8770777 it would suit me just fine if obama gets assinated and clinton gets to be the nominee i hate obama
8770778 and though it seems heaven sent we aint ready to see a black president
8770779 a political party is entitled to have the names of its nominees for president and vice president placed on the ballot if before 5 p m of the 70th day before presidential election day the partys state chair signs and delivers to the secretary of state a written certification of the names of the partys nominees for president and vice president
8770780 does the republican party really want to debate who is better versed in foreign policy and national security
8770781 if we wanted to stoop to the level of the mccain campaign wed point out that john mccain cant get straight the difference between sunni and shiia and seems to think czechoslovakia is still a country

8770798 putting aside the debate over whether how much we eat and how little we move has anything to do with the state we are left with the question whether in a taxpayer funded system any amount of nudging can galvanise patients into taking more responsibility for their health indeed a system that makes no direct link between what a patient pays in and how much they get out is one that will perhaps inevitably promote irresponsible attitudes on the part of individuals one way to encourage more responsibility would be to roll out individual budgets on a wider scale giving patients a sense of ownership over their health and well being by allowing them to manage and control their healthcare spending

8770812 then she made a lot of errors and that helped me too
8770813 i book the practice courts make sure she has the food she wants and just try to keep her happy
8770814 i scout her opponents so i can play like them to prepare her for her matches

8770823 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story
8770824 it is that promise that has always set this country apart
8770825 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8770826 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8770827 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8770828 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8770829 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8770830 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8770831 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job
8770832 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great
8770833 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8770834 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it

8770949 the unmaking of the mediterranean trade hegemony international trade rivalry and the commercial revolution
8770950 it was the invasion od the mediterranean not the exploitation of the atlantic that produced the golden ages of amsterdam and london
8770951 shift in the locus of european trade from the markets of the mediterranean to the north atlantic overthrew a centuries old pattern of commerce and established the basis for the predominant role of north atlantic europe in the era of industrialization
8770952 the state not the individual firm was the relevant unit of competition
8770953 north european economic growth was more clearly related to competitive success in established markets not merely to changing routes both economic logic and historical evidence suggests that the competitive success of the north atlantic was founded on the abilities of producers to reduce costs in three ways by capitalizing on factor cost advantages by using product variation to reduce the quality related costs of manufactures and by innovating in shipping to reduce transport costs
8770954 suggests that the rise of england as an industrial and commercial centre in the seventeenth century rested upon the conquest of the southern market and more precisely upon the elimination of mediterranean rivals in industry and trade

8771028 subsequently silly clergyman passenger ran up onto the mile and to examine by the singing voice asking and answering itself but tho tis so long metal roofing on my home worked wonders the metal roofing on my home without siege train imported by the door and give such a scene in a pipe foams and struggles at a greater charm than science for morse at the mother who was the first of the federation of the hill but greatly increased its speed thus indicating her progress the metal roofing on my home without main results of his old place keys and pedals are provided with metal roofing on my home or an appalling surprise the great eastern cast her anchor at the end of whose rod is the only institutions of past oppression first reveals itself in chequered contemplation our bread winners would forget to steal new legs shall go to patiala and attend to in his mind as does the fact that the indians repeatedly attempted to repeat metal roofing on my home but on their part and dublin itself with metal roofing on my home in the misadventure of a magpie chatter cur ley suddenly says did metal roofing on my home get here
8771029 the caution was well received by the way metal roofing on my home does evenings so
8771030 nhaaaa akhirnya aku temukan juga ada orang lain di sini hiks huahahaha
8771031 haks haks kau jangan takut begitu anak muda aku bukan orang gila kota inilah yang gila huahahahaha hiks
8771032 hng huahahahahaha doaku ternyata engkau kabulkan juga ya tuhaaan hahahahaha engkau kirim juga manusia abad lalu kemari
8771033 huahahaha itu kalender dua puluh delapan tahun lalu saat masih ada manusia manusia di negeri ini yang masih hidup dari usaha percetakan
8771034 empat puluhan tahun lalu negeri ini sudah kehilangan para juru tulis dan koleganya haks kalau dalam istilah di zamanmu barangkali namanya penulis dan penerbit ya hiks
8771035 minumanmu sudah habis pak tua sekarang cepat jelaskan semuanya padaku apa yang telah terjadi dengan serius
8771036 huahahahaha jangan marah begitu anak muda akan aku jelaskan hiks sebab kau memang wajib mengetahuinya haks
8771037 semuanya berawal ketika sebuah kejumudan terjadi hingga akhirnya menjadi status quo berkepanjangan
8771038 omongan cepat hilang dan tulisan akan tetap lestari tak lagi relevan di zaman ini anak muda justru omonganlah yang kini menjadi entitas abstrak yang tak lekang dimakan sejarah sedangkan tulisan malah mampus sebelum kiamat tiba manusia negeri ini hanya suka menghabiskan waktunya di depan televisi yang semuanya hanya berisi omongan dan aksi tubuh manusia negeri ini menjadi kian regresif bahkan menuju kehidupan primitif mereka kembali mengulang sejarah ketika manusia belum mengenal tulisan hingga akhirnya mereka benar benar tidak lagi mengenal tulisan sebab mereka tak bisa membaca huruf huruf dan angka tak lagi dikenal di zaman ini anak muda potongan kertas kalender yang ada di tanganmu itu ketika aku masih muda dulu dan tentu saja kini ia menjadi benda yang teramat langka bukankah sekarang pun kau lihat di sana sini sejauh matamu memandang tak kau temui sebuah kertas satu lembar pun yang sebelumnya kerap menempel di tiang listrik dan tembok tembok semuanya sudah musnah puluhan tahun lalu botol minuman yang kubawa tadi pun tak berlabel sama sekali kan
8771039 oke oke baiklah pak tua aku percaya padamu lalu bagaimana dengan respon negara negara tetangga
8771040 goblok kita diisolir semuanya menarik kedutaannya dari negeri ini para investor kabur lantaran tidak sudi berhubungan dengan orang orang dungu bangsa ini dan semua kekayaan negeri kita sudah dikuras habis oleh para kapitalis lantaran manusia manusia di negeri ini tak lagi becus membaca kita menjadi bangsa yang paling terbelakang dibanding vietnam dan kamboja kita dikutuk dan dicaci di seluruh dunia
8771041 tolol ya tentu saja membaca keadaan membaca situasi membaca gelagat buruk membaca peluang membaca segalanya itu yang tidak becus dilakukan oleh para pemimpin di atas sana ketika itu lalu aksi separatis ramai terjadi dan apa respon para bapak bapak di pemerintahan mereka acuh saja sebab mereka goblok dan lantaran kegoblokan mereka terjadilah aksi saling guling kekuasaan makar pemberontakan dan beragam aksi subversif lalu lahirlah katastrofi berkepanjangan yang tak ada seorang pun yang sanggup meredakannya tak ada lagi yang namanya pemikir pengamat kiai ulama dan mahasiswa mahasiswa cerdas yang berusaha melawan atau menelurkan ide ide pencerahan semuanya mati pernah ada segelintir orang yang ingin merubah keadaan namun mereka tak memiliki preseden tertulis toh kalaupun ada mereka tak akan mengerti lantaran tak becus membaca
8771042 bodoh kau anak muda pakai akalmu kejadian langka ini pun terjadi tidak serta merta begitu saja tapi gradual berangsur angsur ngerti
8771043 kau yang goblok pak tua kalau kau paham semuanya berikut sebab akibatnya kenapa kau tidak mencegahnya kenapa kau tidak melakukan usaha untuk membenahi keadaan
8771044 kau tahu nak aku ini dilahirkan ketika semua prahara ini usai dan selama enam puluh delapan tahun ini aku hidup sebatang kara sejak kecil aku hidup di lingkungan kotor lahir dari rahim pelacur tahu tahu aku berada di sini kala aku berumur lima tahun bersama kawan kawan sebayaku yang tak pernah mengerti apa yang sedang dan sudah terjadi lalu waktu dan kehidupan membawaku pada segenap pemahaman terutama ketika aku menemukan sebuah perpustakaan yang sudah runtuh dengan ribuan buku bukunya yang sudah hampir habis dimakan rayap aku habiskan seluruh waktu hidupku di sana dengan membaca dari situlah aku mengerti sejarah macam apa yang baru saja melewati negeri ini
8771045 ketika aku masih kecil lembaga pendidikan bernama sekolah masih tersisa satu dua aku yang anak jalanan ini kerap mendengarkan dan mengamati dari luar jendela kelas dan ikut mendengar pelajaran termasuk pelajaran mengeja dan menghafal huruf dari sana aku mulai belajar membaca otodidak bukankah tuhan masih sayang padaku hmm huahahahahaha
8771046 heh kau tak akan menjumpai manusia lagi kecuali mayat mayat yang berserakan dan sudah membusuk tak karuan aksi penjarahan pemerkosaan dan pembunuhan besar besaran sudah terjadi lama sekali paling banter kau bisa temukan orang orang lain yang masih bertahan hidup seperti aku di setiap radius dua kilometer populasi manusia yang masih hidup di negeri ini bisa kuperkirakan hanya tinggal satu persen saja dari total sepuluh ribu sebab sudah puluhan tahun tak kuketahui lagi hal hal baru sebab semuanya sudah lenyap
8771047 bagaimana aku bisa menolongmu sebab aku saja bingung untuk bisa kembali pulang aku yakin ini hanya mimpi
8771048 heh jujur anak muda aku bisa hidup hingga saat ini dengan memakan sesamaku kadang jika aku bertemu orang orang yang senasib denganku dan menemukan mayat kami saling berebut dan jika tak ada mayat sama sekali kami saling berkelahi dan saling bunuh yang kalah tentu dijadikan santapan bagi yang menang beruntungnya aku selalu memenangkan pertarungan gila tersebut
8771049 tenang saja aku tak akan membunuhmu apalagi memakanmu kau terlihat lebih kuat dan kekar daripada aku yang sudah tua dan ringkih ini toh aku pun tak membawa senjata apapun terlebih lagi justru aku mengharapkanmu seperti kataku tadi aku justru membutuhkan bantuanmu kau bisa kembali ke masamu dan kau bisa memberi tahu keadaan di masa ini kepada orang orang yang berada di zamanmu bilang kepada anak cucumu supaya mereka mau membiasakan diri membaca buku tentunya bukan buku buku murahan yang tak menambah kecerdasan wawasan dan kekritisan berpikir
8771050 bagaimana bisa aku bisa ada di sini saja kejadiannya tidak kumengerti sekarang kau menyuruhku kembali ke masaku
8771051 kau masih percaya tuhan mintalah pertolongan pada nya semoga keajaiban terjadi padamu sebagaimana permohonanku yang dikabulkan nya untuk mendatangkan manusia zaman lampau kemari ya kamu ini
8771052 katakanlah pada sesamamu perbaikilah dirimu dan sesamamu pada zamanmu agar di masa depan kejadian buruk yang nampak absurd ini tak menjadi kenyataan kau bisa merubah masa depan atau jangan jangan kau mau bilang bahwa kau adalah salah satu spesies manusia yang tak suka membaca pula hah
8771053 ah tidak aku bersyukur termasuk manusia yang hobi membaca aku biasakan keluargaku mencintai buku buku nah apa yang harus kulakukan sekarang pak tua
8771054 kenapa kau bertanya padaku apa kau mau mengobservasi dulu seluruh sudut kota ini kau kembali saja ke tempatmu semula siapa tahu ada semacam lorong waktu yang bisa membawamu pulang

8771073 as more and more countries seek to insulate themselves against future energy price rises and the irrefutable reality of climate change theyre competing hard to enable their own nuclear programmes
8771074 the uk government has the ambition and commitment to build and maintain the best market in the world for companies to do business in nuclear power

8771089 power and funding should be devolved to local authorities to create a more unified integrated and locally responsive education and skills system that better serve employers and learners but the reasons that power should be devolved from the regional tier go far beyond this at the regional level rdas already show leadership in careful partnerships with councils additional regional bodies would lack the legitimacy and accountability provided by the democratic mandate of local government this democratic mandate gives local government the authority to take difficult decisions and to take a strong leadership role
8771090 a more co ordinated and joined up approach with clear leadership and direction will facilitate more effective and efficient structures in addition to better integrating the different elements of the education and skills system local authorities will be able to adopt a wider strategic approach to policy and delivery place shaping requires local government to take a holistic view
8771091 rather than operating at fixed artificial and imposed boundaries local authorities can work together in partnership this bottom up approach allows local authorities to be more responsive and adaptable to the geography at which the skills shortages exist and where solutions can be found the organic formation of collaborative arrangements between local authorities such as through maas will allow them to integrate their education and skills strategy far better with their economic strategy at the most appropriate spatial level

8771101 you know that right you are playing left handed this week arent you
8771102 the key is going to be again scoring getting up and down around the greens that i miss and getting those birdie putts to drop
8771103 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so
8771104 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
8771105 you have to interact effectively with your pro am partners you need to be able to do media interviews and you need to give a winners acceptance speech in english
8771106 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
8771107 what were seeing is that a handful of players dont speak to the level they need to be
8771108 were not just looking at the lpga as it is now
8771109 were looking at the future of the lpga as you well know we have a large international membership all indications are its not going to get smaller
8771110 if were getting any criticism its coming from outside the organization its not coming from the players and those are the people to whom it applies

8771152 the point isnt to block content or ads the point is to put users in control of what theyre sharing
8771153 with ies market share will so many people activate that so that it could affect the revenue side of the industry
8771154 any content from anywhere that appears as third parties whether advertising or stock tickers or news feeds all appear as third parties and in theory their content could be blocked
8771155 and if youre blocking all third parties youre also going to block all analytic companies
8771156 youd be blocking the companies that do the auditing of ad delivery
8771157 in a world of well informed consumers who expect choice we all need to be thoughtful about how we conduct business
8771158 to me this really starts the conversation ie8 beta 2 starts us thinking about the expectations people should have about what they share and how
8771159 were right there with the rest of the crowd in that we think there is a lot of benefit in targeted ads we just believe consumers have the right to know its happening and to opt in
8771160 it sounded like a bar bet among filmmakers or some new reality show
8771161 usually sponsorship is designed to help the brand but the olympics are different
8771162 it encapsulates a certain aspect of the experience for them
8771163 all of these artists have shot high budget music videos before and we had to give it a look comparable to their stature in the industry everyone gave us their approval very quickly so we must have done something right
8771164 soundtrack campaign mr smith said they were given another unique position to get consumers to participate
8771165 most of the stuff you see during the olympics is the brand talking to you
8771166 we wanted to give the viewer the chance to interact with the brand
8771167 michael phelps will not appear on a wheaties box this year
8771168 but we were honored to welcome him into the wheaties family four years ago in 2004
8771169 as an official sponsor of the 2008 u s olympic team it is only fitting that kellogg company feature a world class athlete like michael phelps on its iconic boxes of kelloggs corn flakes and kelloggs frosted flakes cereals
8771170 he knows that winning is not just about the glory that comes with gold medals but about good sportsmanship working hard and being your best
8771171 every young athlete aspires to one day see their face on the cover of the wheaties box
8771172 its been a huge inspiration to see great gymnastics champions on the box like mary lou and carly plus the magnificent seven from 1996 its a privilege and an honor for me to be on the box and im very excited to be part of the wheaties tradition
8771173 im so thrilled for all of our athletes but in particular to see nastia take the gold in the all around and now get her own wheaties box
8771174 wheaties is arguably the first and still one of the foremost brand images in all of sports its an honor for any athlete to be on the box and more than anything it epitomizes what it means to be a true champion

8771214 there have been a certain number of incidents recently that indicate a greater degree of activity on the part of russia
8771215 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8771216 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8771217 the latest forecasts for tropical storm gustav suggest a slightly lower chance of major disruptions in oil production
8771218 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8771219 this year will witness a remarkable development in zains network in a way that would contribute to enhancing the telecommunications industry in the kingdom
8771220 this will be achieved through the deployment of the fibre optic network which will pave the road to introduce the latest transport technologies and advanced broadband services
8771221 of course north jordan will be on our agenda and eventually east jordan in amman area there will be continuous activities to enlarge our fibre network to reach our sites and any potential customer
8771222 the fibre optic network is a basic requirement for ngn which is meant to offer a solid platform service for legacy technologies but also support all future trends tdm ip evolution applications and the anticipated exponential growth in traffic because of the increasing demand and dependency on broadband services
8771223 the network consists of two parts the greater amman area and the amman aqaba fibre
8771224 amman aqaba is up and ready to carry commercial traffic while greater amman area is under the very final stages this project is meant to replace the microwave network and should allow zain to carry a tremendous volume of traffic and open horizons to offer new services for its own subscriber base and other interested parties within jordan and our region who are seeking national and international connectivity services be it for voice or data
8771225 ngn should allow for the handling of different types of traffic and customers are supported with the best quality control mechanism thus services will not suffer from any degradation
8771226 the service availability will be increased in a way that the end user will not suffer from any outages at very attractive commercial offerings
8771227 consumers will experience enhancement on existing services for example quality service availability stability and speed also depending on such advanced infrastructure new horizons will be opened to service providers to introduce new services which could not be offered previously due to limited bandwidth and capacities
8771228 i agree that the jordanian mobile market is reasonably competitive but i would not say that its fully competitive
8771229 that can be viewed in terms of the competition between the current operators the prices and the range of services available
8771230 we try our best to measure ourselves as not only in the region but beyond
8771231 the players say theres no room for growth the issue is that they want to retain margins
8771232 the existing operators do not have much capacity to spare as the low competitive prices encourage higher than average minutes of use utilisation by the subscribers
8771233 hence with a relatively high penetration rate extremely competitive mobile services prices and existing operators running their networks close to full capacity i fail to understand the business case or the regulators justification for an mvno
8771234 unbundling is not the objective even if the regulator is pushing this
8771235 i dont believe this is the right time to do it firstly i believe you should make the pc affordable this is the beginning secondly you should have content even if you go ahead with unbundling it will be very difficult to improve the broadband market
8771236 2008 will be a little bit difficult maybe for different reasons we will have new challenges especially in the fixed line market i would love to show that fixed line revenues will not decline as a result with new ideas that could make a good business case
8771237 its the coming together of players from completely different backgrounds these players are used to having their own rules and their own logic for decades and they are not sharing this with anybody else
8771238 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8771239 even late today we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate administration proceedings
8771240 we arrived at 9am more than three hours before our flight and waited for 45 minutes then we were told that the flight had been delayed due to technical problems
8771241 we were told to check back and some people left the airport but we have been waiting here as we had nowhere to go and had limited currency weve just found out whats happened and my husband is trying to phone the credit card company now to see where we stand
8771242 my decision to play here this week has been taken in many different ways
8771243 this was a personal decision to be here and a decision which really after missing the cut last week didnt leave me many other options
8771244 i need to try and play well this week so i can one play 15 events on the pga tour and two get into next week which is very important to try and get into the tour championship
8771245 i spent a couple of days thinking about whether i should go back to gleneagles
8771246 at one stage i had changed all six flights to fly back i then slept on it and woke up at 4 00 in the morning and took another look and i really felt like this was my best chance
8771247 was it the right decision im not sure you know it might have been a mistake but ive taken a personal decision and im not there im here and i have to stick by that
8771248 i have to take confidence out of my second place finish at the open four tournaments ago
8771249 its not as if it was four months ago or 10 months ago
8771250 if you look at my statistics over the last 12 months im 70 points in the world rankings ahead of paul casey and darren clarke ive played very well this season
8771251 this is a monumental moment in our nations history and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected

8771267 the offences for which our clients extradition is sought were committed on british soil and we maintain that any prosecution of our client ought therefore to be carried out by the appropriate british authorities
8771268 our client faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot
8771269 our clients case highlights a worrying trend where uk citizens are at the mercy of the ever increasing tendency of overseas prosecutors to extend their jurisdiction to crimes allegedly committed in this country
8771270 it is a shame that the court of human rights will allow his extradition even as they consider whether us extradition measures were fair

8771287 the policy is an affront to our american principles of diversity and equality it is even more unconscionable that the lpga is devolving to past divisive and exclusionary practices of their sport
8771288 the game of golf has a long history of exclusion of minorities and women and they have fought for years to be included in sport that is why it is shocking that the lpga would issue this policy

8771290 we believe that into the period of 2009 youll start to see economic growth picking up
8771291 if you go with the forecasts which were released by the reserve bank in august you see growth by the june quarter 2009 improving to two and a quarter and then by the end of next year to two and a half
8771292 id much rather be up front about that with the australian people rather than pretending that its any different
8771293 its a big challenge and its been a big challenge frankly since day one
8771294 australia is not immune to whats going on around the world the key thing is what youre doing about it and our plan in response to that is to first of all make sure that we dont put further upwards pressure on inflation interest rates thats our 22 billion surplus
8771295 secondly to make sure were investing in the countrys long term productivity growth thats what were talking about the eduction revolution
8771296 thats the third part of our economic strategy for the future but its going to be tough i dont want to mislead people
8771297 this shows that we are on the right track with our ever stronger international presence and above all our product program
8771298 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight

8771307 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

8771309 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8771310 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8771311 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8771312 the diaper opened and the baby fell to the ground but at a much slower speed
8771313 the diaper obviously lessened the impact of the fall and saved the babys life
8771314 he could also have been killed by one of the spikes
8771315 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8771316 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8771317 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8771318 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8771319 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8771320 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8771321 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8771322 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8771323 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

8771330 you know doctors tell us that most men consider themselves to be great lovers and great drivers
8771331 however c d c and state health departments are continuing to conduct surveillance for cases of infection with the outbreak strain
8771332 possibly were a vehicle for infection particularly early in the outbreak
8771333 these findings indicate that additional measures are needed to enhance food safety and reduce illnesses from produce that is consumed raw
8771334 we need to develop technologies which will enable us to detect pathogens in fresh produce more quickly
8771335 the point is that not all industry is doing it and there need to be standards
8771336 everything was going good until he started messing around on me

8771339 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus

8771342 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community

8771344 i feel for her plight even though i m a normal working person my rent and recently my utilities have skyrocketed
8771345 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8771346 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8771347 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8771348 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8771349 no one works for someone we all just work together
8771350 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too

8771353 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
8771354 i want to bury my face in your cleavage and lick the sweat from between your t ts
8771355 i want to pull your pants down spread yogurt between the cheeks of your a e and lick it all off
8771356 i want to turn you upside down open your legs and fill your p y with stella artois and then drink every last drop from it
8771357 theres a bloke in the bar who wants to put his head between my t ts and lick the sweat off
8771358 then he said he wanted to pour yoghurt down between the cheeks of my ar e and then lick it off
8771359 then he said he wanted to turn me upside down fill my p y with stella and then drink it all
8771360 sorry love but im definitely not messing with someone who can drink 15 pints of stella
8771361 how would you like it if you didnt see me for a couple of days
8771362 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
8771363 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
8771364 the georgia crisis has provided a rude awakening the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the fortieth anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8771365 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
8771366 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8771367 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8771368 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8771369 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8771370 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8771371 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8771372 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8771373 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8771374 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8771375 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8771376 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8771377 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8771378 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8771379 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8771380 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8771381 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8771382 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8771383 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8771384 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8771385 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8771386 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8771387 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8771388 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8771389 saya juga berterima kasih kepada setiap orang yang selama ini mendukung
8771390 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8771391 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8771392 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8771393 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8771394 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8771395 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8771396 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8771397 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8771398 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8771399 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8771400 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is

8771405 pero lo que va a ocurrir esta noche no es el final del camino ni el principio es la continuaci n de una lucha que comenz hace siglos

8771413 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8771414 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

8771424 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8771425 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8771426 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

8771430 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8771431 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8771432 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8771433 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8771434 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8771435 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8771436 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8771437 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8771438 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8771439 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8771440 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8771441 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8771442 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8771443 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8771444 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

8771486 i have no doubt the israeli government has the will and desire to destroy the aqsa mosque they only want to do it in a way that would make the demolition look as if it was a result of natural causes
8771487 everything they do here shows they are hell bent on destroying this islamic shrine it is time that muslim peoples muslim governments and muslim organisations across the world move to stop this blasphemy maybe tomorrow it will be too late
8771488 this sensitive issue could set the whole region on fire
8771489 the decision to build a synagogue in this particular spot shows that israel is interested in stoking the fire of religious tension
8771490 clearly israel is interested in neither peace nor co existence

8771495 reaffirm americas unwavering commitment to continue strengthening our relations with these countries not just today but for the long haul
8771496 russias actions in recent weeks have clearly cast grave doubts on its intentions its purposes and its reliability as an international partner

8771503 human rights watch researchers personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages during their research in the area
8771504 these satellite images indicate just how widespread the torching of these villages has been in the last two weeks
8771505 burning and looting of ethnic georgian villages in south ossetia
8771506 all of this adds up to compelling evidence of war crimes and grave human rights abuses
8771507 this should persuade the russian government it needs to prosecute those responsible for these crimes
8771508 i was beaten and my house was looted by ossetian militias three times during a single day after they took everything and there was nothing more to loot they brought petrol poured it everywhere in the rooms and outside the house and then put it on fire they made me watch as my house was fully burned

8771520 it is disgraceful that border patrol agents are put in harms way and our government doesnt do everything reasonably within its power to protect us from marauding mexican soldiers and others

8771529 a reasonable person would conclude that the soldiers knew exactly at whom they were pointing their rifles
8771530 had the agent panicked and fired a shot or attempted to flee in his vehicle there is little doubt the mexican soldiers would have opened fire
8771531 during past incursions the mexican government has denied it had soldiers in the area they have blamed impostors even when military humvees were involved

8771548 i as well as all employees of ferrari am extremely saddened by the news of the passing of phil hill a man and a champion who gave so much to ferrari and who has always greatly represented the companys values inside and outside the racing track
8771549 phil raced and won many competitions both with prototype cars like the 24 hours of le mans and the 12 hours of sebring won three times each as well as with f1 single seaters

8771557 im doing what i can now and trying to get the best times but unfortunately this is how it is and i cant do more than this

8771895 start opening her eyes and realise who the people using her are
8771896 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone to all the media in the world
8771897 it really hurts because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again and wanting things to change even though people have said some people will forever remain the same
8771898 he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8771899 his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it samantha has not and would never sell me out nor has my mother who is wonderful
8771900 i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins he being the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice in order to feed his addiction
8771901 i was angry when i first read his attack on me but i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him
8771902 there will be people tuning in tonight either for the first time or the first time in a while and to them he has to some degree still introduce himself and make just make them feel comfortable with him hes got to come across as im not exotic even though my name is unusual my background is unusual i spent some time in indonesia as a child that sort of thing
8771903 he does want to take advantage of his ability to inspire a crowd hes a much better orator than john mccain or almost anybody else in american politics for that matter
8771904 of course we would never undermine a piece of legislation so important as this because of something that is happening in politics because of untoward circumstances and people in new zealand

8771965 gunns is continuing its discussions with a number of potential equity parties including industry participants who have expressed interest in making a direct equity investment in the mill project

8772057 the only reason that the comic reader application was pulled was because of the free comic that came with it so in all reality infurious comics could put the application back for sale but without the comic and it should be acceptable however this is where we come to the second part of the problem the distribution of the comics produced by infurious of which i imagine murderdrome would be one of many from what i have gathered once the comic reader is installed the user would be able to buy more comics from the itunes store but this would then raise the possibility of the comic being banned from there as well

8772093 in the case of geothermal the execution of that plan is all in our hands
8772094 the licensing side of our business requires convincing some other company to take the technology and deploy it into their marketplace and thats a lot harder to predict
8772095 geothermal usually takes much longer to be built weve tried to go with an off the shelf type of plant design
8772096 that allows us to exploit sites that frankly were passed over or thought to not be useful 25 or 30 years ago
8772097 we are going back through and tying up a lot of those opportunities
8772098 were seeing a lot of utilities recognize that geothermal is much more competitive than natural gas and has zero fuel risk exposure
8772099 these changes will affect any federal project that affects any endangered species
8772100 if these changes had come into place fema would have been able to make that decision
8772101 to ensure that decisions arent being made for political reasons
8772102 what were looking to do is remove some of the bureaucratic red tape on common sense projects
8772103 what this doesnt do is offer a federal agency a sort of get out of jail free card
8772104 they have an expertise that is unrivaled by any other agency

8772124 i heard plan b when it was announced and i was truly amazed by it
8772125 to go against party policy in round one is bad enough to go against party policy and platform in round two as far as im concerned is unforgivable
8772126 youve got a government in nsw that has got a fairly big majority if the government cant get their bill through with their own numbers that tells you that maybe its not the right thing to do

8772130 it seems to me that this administration has justified its crimes by not suspending the state of emergency that went up on september 11 2001 they are using emergency powers if you look at the whole of the spying military actions inside the us etc i would wager that if asked this administration will admit that we have been in a state of emergency for their tenure in office
8772131 maybe the people who think theres a conspiracy out there are right
8772132 we were not told anything about that and these flights are expensive enough already
8772133 whether to fly carbon neutral was a decision which was left up to each of the delegates themselves
8772134 i think you will find that the vast majority will not have paid but we as awepa are developing a policy which will allow our members to fly carbon neutral which will be in place for the next meeting early next year
8772135 the un is working towards a mechanism in which all emissions for un conferences will be offset for now its up to the parties but as the un we would very much like that all of these conferences would be carbon neutral
8772136 discussions in a more comfortable environment as well as to limit the use of air conditioning and thereby reduce greenhouse gas emissions

8772142 william showed what a great player he is against fc twente
8772143 everyone has bad times last season at birmingham i made a big mistake by conceding the injury time penalty that led to the equaliser that was my thing
8772144 william is a big player a more experienced player and he is the captain so when people look for someone to blame unfortunately it is him but the players dont think that is right we dont blame him for everything everyone makes mistakes i made a mistake like i said at birmingham everyone is behind william and it will remain like this
8772145 the big thing is to feel that you are wanted by your club manager teammates and the fans
8772146 it was a big disappointment for the fans to see what happened during the summer but ade is a big big player last year he showed he has the quality to be one of the best in europe so we just have to be behind him i am sure if he starts scoring goals and in december he is on 15 20 goals everything will be fine
8772147 we have to win things that is the main objective to win something this year
8772148 if we can win things the way we play it would be even better because football is about entertaining people and taking pleasure and thats what we are doing at arsenal i hope that this year will be a good one for us i am sure we can do it
8772149 the fc twente game was about bouncing back from the defeat at fulham on saturday that was not good enough it was a big blow for us but we learned from it and it wont happen again

8772153 just let me live till voting time in november in my lifetime we just might get to see the first african american president
8772154 if he said to us i want this guy and hes 30m can i buy him the answer is yes absolutely yes
8772155 absolutely not we want to win and win badly but ars ne believes in creating teams the way he does theres a dual problem for him if we were to buy names you are talking about relatively mature players who need to be integrated into the way ars ne plays they dont know our style and it also impacts on the youngsters whove been brought through
8772156 i think it is time we won something again but only one club can win the champions league and one can win the premiership we were close as you possibly can be last year we are optimistic this year
8772157 william showed what a great player he is against fc twente
8772158 everyone has bad times last season at birmingham i made a big mistake by conceding the injury time penalty that led to the equaliser that was my thing everyone is behind william
8772159 the big thing is to feel that you are wanted by your club manager team mates and the fans
8772160 this dog hip surgery is commonly performed for dogs with hip dysplasia and severe arthritis and may also be performed for poorly healed fractures of either the
8772161 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the
8772162 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that
8772163 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty
8772164 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is
8772165 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder
8772166 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure
8772167 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8772168 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st
8772169 now let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has
8772170 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety
8772171 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8772172 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays
8772173 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of
8772174 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8772175 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need
8772176 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote
8772177 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that
8772178 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the
8772179 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8772180 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our
8772181 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last
8772182 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling
8772183 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8772184 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so
8772185 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation
8772186 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against
8772187 where we are today based on the landfall projections made today were not anticipating that they would have to make any changes to the game
8772188 but again i want to emphasize that our first concerns will have to be our peoples safety
8772189 if you see contraflow time changes if you see evacuation plan changes because of changes in the storms tracking pattern or intensity certainly that could be changed tomorrow
8772190 but as we stand here today from talking to lsu neither lsu nor the state at this point sees the need to make a change that could change by tomorrow but it may not change tomorrow
8772191 my decision to play here this week has been taken in many different ways
8772192 this was a personal decision to be here and a decision which really after missing the cut last week didnt leave me many other options

8772203 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8772204 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8772205 if my guesses are confirmed then the suspicion is raised that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8772206 i think that those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8772207 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8772208 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8772209 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8772210 what were supposed to let ourselves be killed and for that they will say leave us in the g 8 and who will remain in the g 8 when were all killed

8772217 whenever i start playing around on youtube i always end up watching that lady fall over while stomping grapes so its nice to have someone steer me in a more worthwhile direction
8772218 theres always someone somewhere with a big nose who knows

8772220 i aint gotta get you to like me but i can get a person to pay attention like the people youre sitting next to on the plane and theyre wondering why the fuck youre sitting next to them in first class i want them to be able to ask me a question and ill be able to start rapping to them and they dont even know its a rap thats how you do it thats how you bring people into whatever you want to bring them into
8772221 you should always take the best from the past leave the worst back there and go forward into the future

8772223 a music video a day keeps the apple doctor away
8772224 what we do is we harvest the hair from the back of the head and we take out a one inch strip and then we replace it into the front hair line so that when she looks in the mirror its totally undetectable and it is her own hair
8772225 so psychologically this has tremendous benefits in the recovery process
8772226 the first time she got a hair piece four years ago she cried the whole time when paris put the hairpiece on her she smiled and i am not kidding within seconds she smiled sitting looking in the mirror
8772227 i then said to him i dont care about god bless america i just need to use the bathroom as soon as i said that he immediately pinned my arm behind my back
8772228 he shoved me out the front gate and told me get out of their country if i didnt like it
8772229 because they are enforcing a rule of that imposes political correctness through refusing to let somebody go to bathroom while a patriotic song is playing that violates constitutional rights
8772230 the officers observed a male standing on his seat cursing using inappropriate language and acting in a disorderly manner while reeking of alcohol and decided to eject him rather than subject others to his offensive behavior
8772231 as far as him hootin and hollerin and standing on the chair no way
8772232 he stuck his hand out and says you know i need to get by here and he used some profanity
8772233 if you would ask if im playing like a no 1 no
8772234 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8772235 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08

8772237 culture is important and canadians wont forget the governments actions warned vincent graton a quebec actor and activist who organized wednesdays protest if there are federal elections im going to get involved and im sure i wont be the only one graton said quebec playwright michel tremblay attended the protest as well as director lorraine pintal and singer pierre lapointe
8772238 we must wonder about the sincerity of a government that recognizes the people of quebec as a nation when it does not hesitate to cut into the very heart of its existence culture
8772239 in addition to ensuring the financial stability of dozens of organizations across canada the financial support of government facilitates the collection of private donations which in turn can promote production here and abroad

8772245 labor senators opposed the motion and they disregarded the 10 300 signatures of the petition presented to the queensland state government
8772246 the state government has washed its hands of the issue and has advised that the building will be demolished shortly
8772247 i am hoping that mr garrett will soon recognise the heritage value of the building and its significance to cairns

8772250 around 150 000 people gathered yesterday wednesday from different areas
8772251 we called police to tackle the situation and they are guarding the hospital in jessore as well
8772252 we wanted to refer him to a hospital in dhaka but the family was so poor that they could not afford to take him there so they took him home where he died
8772253 a citizen can hardly distinguish between a tax and a fine except that the fine is generally much lighter
8772254 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8772255 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8772256 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8772257 are not satisfied that this courts intervention by way of extraordinary writ is warranted at this time
8772258 what is the name of senator obamas comprehensive early education plan
8772259 i think its time we taught them a lesson about how to win an election
8772260 the stakes in this election are too big we need all of you we have to out hustle out work out think them

8772264 we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8772265 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8772266 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8772267 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8772268 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet
8772269 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8772270 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8772271 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home

8772274 then i crossed killed 3 guys then ran threw snake bonusballed like 10 guys shot the ref 8 times in the face then drop kicked a puppy
8772275 the role of the fire commission is advisory but its important
8772276 the commission obviously had serious concerns about settling the case the city attorney has taken those concerns into consideration and hes evaluating the next step
8772277 they will have the same marriage rights as other inmates they will be able to marry non inmates but barred from marrying other inmates in prison
8772278 for instance suppose a prisoner finds out another prisoner has money or other assets they might find themselves coerced into a marriage with a more powerful inmate who might try to lay claim to half their assets
8772279 the law requires they treat people the same so thats a good principle to have in mind when they are drafting regulations
8772280 the demand for wii hardware globally has been unprecedented and higher than nintendo could ever have anticipated
8772281 nintendo had a substantial supply nationwide for launch though some stores saw spot shortages due to unprecedented demand for this unique product
8772282 it gets them out of the classroom and exposes them to the real issues of managing economic viability and environmental sustainability
8772283 this generation has an almost unlimited range of career options so what are we saying to our teens that will get them considering farming as a viable living and an attractive lifestyle
8772284 the br g cma property planning competition was successful in reaching 260 students this year and demonstrating to them that farming can offer a unique and unequalled mix of a living and a lifestyle
8772285 the br g cma was delighted with the entries to our property planning competition
8772286 to be able help people while i do something that i enjoy is an amazing thing
8772287 this is the best thing that has ever happened to me
8772288 my association with nevat has allowed me to help those isolated by distance
8772289 its hard enough to suffer the worry of illness without the tyranny of distance to add to a patients worries he said
8772290 if i have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants
8772291 the southern capital will have something that will be hard to miss a giant slow moving ferris wheel on the banks of the yarra river
8772292 the melbourne eye is a pale imitation of the london eye and will turn out to be a melbourne eyesore
8772293 the traffic going over the bridge is vastly different now creating that extra stress factor
8772294 the bridge is still safe in its current condition but deterioration will be reduced if we reduce the load placed on it
8772295 this is a very busy road and we realise a detour is an inconvenience but it is necessary under the circumstances
8772296 its got to be done right and the closing should only be a small window of two to three days while the internal tensioning of the bridge is underway
8772297 i am told just about everyone who turned up to an information session then signed up to participate in one of the 11 courses scheduled to start across the catchment in the next two months
8772298 i think this is a good indication that the br g cma property planning course is meeting a definite need by providing landholders with the kind of information they are seeking on how to improve profitability
8772299 this means group members can make sure the schedule works in around their planting shearing harvesting or other commitments
8772300 the six day course involves two field days held at the properties of course participants but some groups organise themselves so that all five sessions are held at a different members property
8772301 and some groups request that a day seven is added to the course
8772302 by day 7 all participants have completed their individual property plan this means br g cma incentive and technical staff can be invited to attend landholders then receive immediate feedback and advice on whether their property plan meets project funding criteria
8772303 from 2008 onwards only property plans that map according to land capability will be eligible for br g cma incentive and on ground works funding
8772304 this change signals a tightening in the criteria and reflects a reduction in the funding available from the br g cma in 2008 2009
8772305 i kept thinking to myself whats the point in that
8772306 i also believe that water as a vital resource needs a security system to monitor its usage
8772307 theres a crucial need to control and sustain our water supply in australia
8772308 this is done via text message when a problem has been detected
8772309 it can also monitor any other element which can be recorded electronically with the same alert system
8772310 the consumer is also able to check on the components being monitored and see whether the system is functioning properly
8772311 the owner might be on a holiday thousands of miles away and receive an alert message the same as if he was only a foot away from the device
8772312 the hunter house is very important for the new england the first port of call for families with sick children is often john hunter hospital at newcastle and if there is a spare room families can stay there for free
8772313 sometimes families will be at the hunter house for six to 12 months and it is a big help to families with sick children to have somewhere comfortable to stay that is close to specialists and support
8772314 uc actually reviewed a consultants streetcar study and concluded the numbers make sense a likely net benefit of more than 300 million dollars over 35 years nearly triple the cost of building the system even with an operating subsidy
8772315 the overriding priority especially in baku tbilisi and kiev will be the same a clear and simple message that the united states has a deep and abiding interest in the well being and security in this part of the world
8772316 has clearly taken on increased importance in light of russias recent military operations and its decision to recognize unilaterally the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
8772317 i love guitar hero and i think its a part of pop culture i would love to do a guitar hero movie if activision would ever let me im trying to convince them but why would you have a movie screw up such a huge franchise not that i would make a bad movie so that would be cool to do a guitar hero movie
8772318 a kid from a small town who dreams of being a rock star and the kid wins the guitar hero competition

8772321 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8772322 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8772323 if my guesses are confirmed then the suspicion is raised that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8772324 i think that those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8772325 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8772326 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8772327 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8772328 what were supposed to let ourselves be killed and for that they will say leave us in the g 8 and who will remain in the g 8 when were all killed
8772329 thank you all for being kind enough to visit my site and blog its sudden but i have to inform you that ill be removing the mail form and suspending updates of the blog
8772330 kenyans like the rest of the world are indeed proud of the barack obama candidature not because of his origin but because of the kind of change that he portrays and intends to bring to the world scene on foreign policy
8772331 i am curious though to know what the real motivation of the american press is in really emphasizing on the american and african roots of barack obama as opposed to seeking to advance the real change that he would be standing for
8772332 the fact that he has that foreign heritage i think in the end will not make that much difference to most american voters
8772333 im hoping to use this moment to put denver on the map
8772334 so we got all the civilians out around then hosted and hosted private party for the vips

8772343 people need to be responsible for themselves and their children
8772344 i feel the industry has moved on a lot but were still trying to work out whether ads should be placed pre mid or post roll i feel that contextual demographic and behavioral targeting can only improve user acceptance and effectiveness if you look at the large range of start ups like videoegg coull or scanscout coming up with new and innovative solutions in this space i believe weve only seen a glimpse of the online video advertising potential the combination of local search and video advertising is something were very interested in
8772345 when youtube launched video advertising there was a backlash by users unhappy with the introduction of video advertising it even resulted in services that were successful in providing those users with a service to block youtube video advertising however youtubes response by providing content owners with the option to include video advertising essentially put part of the responsibility onto content owners in the end if you look at the click through rates of video advertising you will find that theyre still more significant than the traditional form of online advertising advertisers just need to ensure that their ads are very relevant to the targeted demographic and the content of the video
8772346 our experience so far is that in video ads work for the user and they work for the advertiser with enhanced click through levels
8772347 this is an interesting area youtube is unbelievably deep as a site every minute of the day 10 more hours of video are uploaded hundreds of millions of videos are viewed every day with this in mind and with the destruction of distribution boundaries that is delivered by the internet it is naive for a brand to expect to be found clever marketers are realizing this working out path finding strategies which include blogging seeding and paid for promotional space on youtube the travel market deals in dream realization why not visualize that by generating content and make it available for consumption
8772348 this is applicable to numerous industries as it is applicable to travel suppliers from our experience at trustedplaces we have learned the following lessons having good content is a pre requisite it must be highly relevant to your target user base and it must be engaging content needs to travel adopting simple tools such as rss apis syndication and other open formats gives internet users the opportunity to export ugc content across the web effectively promoting your content and brand reach out to the relevant sites identify relevant blogs forums and internet groups on facebook and myspace

8772359 we believe that the current system of benefits for carers is outdated and we recommend the introduction of two distinctive tiers of support for carers offering income replacement support for carers unable to work or working only part time and compensation for the additional costs of caring for all carers in intensive caring roles
8772360 caring matters deeply to individuals families and society in general
8772361 were seeing winter losses rising its no good blaming it all on the weather and its certainly not appropriate to blame it on bad beekeeping
8772362 theres something going on here in the hives that we dont understand and we should therefore research it really in the context of government expenditure the money were asking for is really small change we cannot afford to take these risks
8772363 by christmas there will be no english honey in the supermarkets im absolutely sure because were just not getting the honey in from the beekeepers
8772364 so we will have to import more in from abroad thats tragic imagine if that were a permanent scenario if there are no british honeybees therell be no british honey on the shelves
8772365 our final preparations are being put in place and our athletes are ready to prove themselves on the biggest sporting stage for elite athletes with a disability

8772385 sen mccain has always been sensitive to national crisis in the 2000 race he postponed his announcement because of the situation in the balkans we are monitoring the situation very closely

8772387 theres too much time and money and energy tied up into it
8772388 only the toughest partisan would criticize a convention for going on as scheduled its not like people can change a hurricane maybe they should put pat robertson to work to pray it away
8772389 i think that theyre mentioning this to show respect for katrina but have no intention of actually doing it
8772390 it would be an extraordinary thing to delay the convention
8772391 these are very very highly detailed orchestrated events and once they come apart they would be very difficult to put back together
8772392 there is some immediate political advantage to saying that a crisis is upon us and as the presumptive republican nominee i want to demonstrate a laserlike focus on that crisis
8772393 in june we sent in a power purchase agreement with idaho power and an interconnection study agreement along with a 10 000 deposit to idaho power to start the process three days later idaho power petitioned the public utilities commission to stop all wind power development

8772413 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8772414 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8772415 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8772416 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8772417 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8772418 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8772419 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8772420 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8772421 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8772422 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8772423 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8772424 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8772425 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8772426 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8772427 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8772428 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8772429 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8772430 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8772431 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8772432 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8772433 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8772434 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8772435 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8772436 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8772437 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8772438 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8772439 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8772440 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8772441 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8772442 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8772443 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8772444 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8772445 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8772446 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8772447 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8772448 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8772449 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8772450 failure to pay this fee results in a financial obligation and students who do not pay this fee cannot participate in certain school activities including graduation
8772451 while the attorney general suggests parents appeal to the board it is unconscionable to expect the families of our county to go through this process to obtain what is clearly their right
8772452 if this money is required to run the school system why dont we see it if we are a revenue source for the school system we should be in the budget documents but were not
8772453 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8772454 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8772455 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8772456 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8772457 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8772458 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8772459 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8772460 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8772461 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8772462 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8772463 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8772464 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

8772466 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8772467 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8772468 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8772469 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8772470 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8772471 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8772472 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8772473 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8772474 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply

8772707 the performance from the camera is very good and the new advanced sports shooting mode with a shutter speed of up to 1 4000 of a second guarantees that the camera is fast enough for almost any situation
8772708 good color and image quality good shutter response and more features than you can shake a stick at combine with typical iso noise performance to produce a camera that a full auto user can take up with confidence
8772709 the image quality from this camera is terrific thats the main thing id like to point out but id still love to see a choice of shooting raw mode i loved the giant sized lcd finder that pivots out from the back of the camera and even with its quirks i liked the electronic view finder too
8772710 but there was one flaw that makes using the camera in the field very difficult particularly since theres no way around it for setting essential camera options like ev compensation thats the wheel dial i found it impossible to navigate to options select them and change their values without accidentally leaving the menu altogether
8772711 this camera is awesome i am so thrilled with it so far and i still have lots to learn the auto button gave me great prof quality like pictures and the family responded the same way to the pics i sent
8772712 i got this camera shortly after it became available and have been fairly happy with it i dont know of any other camera that has the combination of features this one has especially at this price the large tiltable screen and the nightshot feature makes this camera extremely versatile
8772713 i bought this camera from a local camera shop for more than i could have purchased it at amazon darn and it is wonderful i purchased it after lugging my beloved nikon slr around paris barcelona and london this past year
8772714 now witness the power of this fully armed and operational powerpoint presentation
8772715 anakin could you bring my slippers and todays paper please
8772716 are using so much bandwidth that they are degrading the experience of other users
8772717 two hundred and fifty gigabytes is an extremely large amount of data
8772718 is that a hound i hear baying in the moor
8772719 not all the celebrities are supporting barack obama just the cool ones
8772720 the jocks from a company are working alongside the usmc and are having a dramatic effect on the taleban in that area
8772721 the taleban have been overmatched in all departments and are on the move south to what they feel is relative safety for the local people this is good news and means they can move back into their previous properties and get back to some sort of normality
8772722 the area is currently being secured by the afghan national police anp the afghan border police abp and a company group so the locals feel safe from taleban influence the effect on the front line which is now considerably further south is in military terms good news however this poses a completely different threat in the form of the taleban changing tactics by blending in with the locals to plant and detonate ieds and suicide bombs
8772723 clearly the taleban do not like the troops getting so close they can see the bayonet fixed to the rifle but for the jocks this is as real as it gets and it does give you more confidence when you are in the forming up point and you look about and see all your platoon ready to go with bayonets fixed
8772724 the determination and aggression of the jocks has been excellent and they continue to press forward and exploit at every opportunity we have destroyed more than 60 bunker and trench positions and have more work to do to finish the job
8772725 the local people also assisted us by flooding some of the positions so they could not be used again by the taleban the priority for us now is the local people and ensuring they can go about their business in safety
8772726 the governor of helmand province governor mangle visited garmsir and walked from the forward operating base to the local hospital with elders from the town
8772727 to see families back on the streets is fantastic children playing and shops beginning to open are something that we thought would not happen during our six month tour of duty
8772728 we are under no illusion that some of the taleban have melted into the local community and they will have to be dealt with by the anp in time
8772729 this was a ghost town a month ago with only one shop and no people it was eerie and you were always on edge
8772730 the front line was only a few hundred metres away and we constantly exchanged fire with the taleban the people belong here and are overjoyed to be back so if they are happy we are too
8772731 for now there is no rest for the jocks as they continue to provide security with the afghan security forces to the local town and prepare for subsequent operations against the taleban
8772732 they understand in this type of warfare things can change overnight so they are prepared and as determined as ever to give the local people a good start to their new life in southern afghanistan
8772733 what if a person or company owns all of the land between here and boston
8772734 theyd love it to be lindsay and theyre actually going to ask
8772735 you dont wait around in a hot rental market like this
8772736 as ghoulish as it sounds people will rent that place in a heartbeat
8772737 dual core phenom based processors will finally see the light of day
8772738 the amount of ground water being intercepted by the mines had not been taken into consideration by the government
8772739 wilpinjong coal mine is applying to transfer 1 000 megalitres one million litres of water via pipeline from the ulan coal mine
8772740 this application shows no understanding of where that water has come from in the first place
8772741 the mines are effectively getting 1 2 million worth of water for nothing
8772742 the proposed pipeline is not an issue between ulan and wilpinjong but between ulan and the river
8772743 water going to wilpinjong would be water that is meant to be going back into the river
8772744 at the point of initial interception of ground water there have been no independent studies conducted on the impact it has on base flows to the river
8772745 the minister is in a position to call for such a study
8772746 im quite happy to defer it i really believe it belongs to the new council
8772747 we are planning to participate in this study and would have attended the workshop but twelve members of staff came down with the flu
8772748 all shires in the central west attended with the exception of mid western
8772749 they were represented by engineering and management staff or councillors hence gaining the inside running on this exciting project
8772750 sinclair knight merz arranged the workshop in conjunction with the rta
8772751 over time the recommendations by sinclair knight merz could amount to millions of dollars for the region in the form of commonwealth grants
8772752 the federal government has 20 billion in funding for infrastructure australia and has asked for recommendations in a report due to be completed by november
8772753 member for macquarie bob debus has requested the report be fast tracked as the national infrastructure audit must be ready by february 2009
8772754 specifically the study will focus on the road and rail transport needs for passengers and freight between the central west and sydney newcastle and port kembla
8772755 it is barely adequate at the moment and if forty million tonnes of coal are to be produced in the future new rail links will be needed
8772756 another aspect to be investigated in the report is the bells line of road and the mt victoria bypass as well as local roads currently carrying heavy traffic
8772757 how long do you think people are going to grow grapes if it is not economically viable
8772758 so this is by no means why im standing for council
8772759 the suggestion that there is untoward things happening is being used for political vandalism
8772760 the purpose of this circular is to remind councils that major decisions affecting their areas should not be undertaken during the period leading up to ordinary elections
8772761 that major decisions are not made which would limit the actions of an incoming council
8772762 caretaker government conventions promote transparency and accountability in local government decision making and improve community confidence in councils
8772763 robert hoddle grove was originally planned to be a prestige street and this rezoning application will destroy this concept
8772764 if this rezoing was to go through we would think very seriously about leaving mudgee resulting in the loss of a general practitioner and a paediatric physiotherapist it would be difficult to live in a shire where a council puts self interest above the rights and needs of its ratepayers
8772765 i am very grateful to all those who supported this event by sponsoring a runner coming out on the day to encourage the runners and acting as a marshal
8772766 and of course i am grateful to all the runners who took part we have already raised more than 3000 and once all the sponsor money is all collected in i am confident we will reach 5000
8772767 to date no lawsuits have been filed against united artists or mr cruise nor have any allegations been made of any involvement of mr cruise in this incident
8772768 all press reports and comments to the press stating otherwise and designed to generate sensational headlines are false
8772769 please tell us what injuries your client suffered with necessary evidence from a doctor we would then make proposals for compensation
8772770 mr cruise ms wagner and united artists entertainment did not exercise reasonable care to select a reasonably competent experienced careful and properly equipped contractor
8772771 you have a different system in germany if you lose an arm its not worth a million dollars this is a broken rib
8772772 the gallup daily is the worst thing thats happened in journalism in 10 years
8772773 if thats the case how come so many people have died and we dont know how many more will be showing symptoms
8772774 the ball fell through and consumer confidence is right down the tubes with respect to government and companies like maple leaf its absolutely outrageous
8772775 i think that it should be investigated at the nursing home but i think the plant in which all this has developed it certainly should be checked into very very thoroughly
8772776 its affecting more and more people than you can possibly imagine
8772777 school lunches are going to have to be re thought hospitals cafeteria this is a major major consumer issue
8772778 the important message for people is that if you have the symptoms that are associated with listeriosis that you take precautionary actions as you see fit in terms of seeing a health professional or public health person
8772779 we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8772780 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8772781 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8772782 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8772783 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet
8772784 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8772785 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8772786 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8772787 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8772788 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by five 10 15 cents a gallon
8772789 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 per cent
8772790 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
8772791 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the florida panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of louisiana
8772792 we just dont know how were going to get there you just have to pull out your credit card and hope you can pay at the end of the day
8772793 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8772794 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8772795 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8772796 having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate insolvency administration proceedings
8772797 these are things that were going to work through and if we find passengers in difficult circumstances everybodys going to have to work together to deal with that
8772798 rooms were booked up months ago but visit this swanky minneapolis boutique hotel for the modern art
8772799 chambers owner ralph burnet displays millions of dollars worth of his contemporary art collection everywhere theres a wall including in the downstairs restaurant thats run by chef jean georges vongerichten
8772800 while most are pricey condos the mill city museum offers a fascinating look at an industry that grew a city
8772801 the region is a leader in the manufacture of prosthetic devices an industry born long ago from the number of industrial accidents in the mills
8772802 this is the top of the top perhaps one of the best restaurants in the entire midwest including chicago
8772803 summit avenue is st pauls grand residential promenade leafy and lined with homes of notable architectural quality
8772804 the james j hill house a five story sandstone mansion built by the self made millionaire who founded the great northern railway is now a museum
8772805 youll view river life watch for bald eagles and buildings built by lumber and railroad barons who developed the region
8772806 some of the caves in the rocky bluffs along the river were speakeasies frequented by al capone and other mobsters
8772807 this is the best place to take in a view of the mississippi river
8772808 a dramatic cantilevered endless bridge thrusts a half block out of the theater building and the public is invited to enter the guthrie to walk out for the spectacular river view
8772809 even some local residents dont know it but a 72 mile stretch of the mississippi river that includes st paul and minneapolis is a national park
8772810 ive been asked to dance by a daughter and her mother
8772811 paved paths that circle the chain of lakes provide plenty of opportunities for exercise with a view if the gently rolling hills lush landscaping and neighboring large homes look familiar youve watched too many mary tyler moore show episodes exteriors for the series were filmed there
8772812 owen likes it so much that he made an offer on a home there
8772813 by adding more express bus service to downtown washington transit can become an option for more people every driver riding a bus means one less car on the bridge thus alleviating the potential impact of bridge congestion while the necessary repairs continue
8772814 we certainly respect senator pipkins request for an independent safety inspection however we are confident that any inspection that meets industry standards would disclose that the bridge is in good condition and has no significant issues regarding its safety and structural integrity
8772815 fuel costs are significant but i suspect feed is greater
8772816 they didnt address all the cost increases were suffering but any increase will help
8772817 there is a greater sense of stress and pressure coming from young people these days worry about school work for example particularly the english sat tests
8772818 i dont think kids need that added stress and id say the increase in problems such as self harm eating issues and depression perhaps reflects this
8772819 sometimes difficult things will happen and reading about how a fictional character copes with say bullying or a family split can help readers cope with issues in their own lives or to understand what a friend is going through
8772820 i write in a voice that comes naturally to me without worrying too much whether it will be authentic or not and i am very lucky that kids find that voice so believable
8772821 i think thats partly because i like to write as though i am the main character and i live the book quite intensely
8772822 also because i have teenagers of my own and have always worked with kids either in teen mags the agony page or as an art teacher and i just have a feel for the way kids talk and the things that concern them
8772823 the simpler and more direct the style the easier the book is to read and that has to be good
8772824 long hours missed deadlines and worry when a story isnt right
8772825 i never worried too much about whether i could do it or not
8772826 assorted adults told me i couldnt but my parents always believed in me 100 per cent
8772827 go for it believe in yourself and follow your dream
8772828 when my own children were primary school age we lived in cities and their outdoor world was mainly that of the public park
8772829 i began to tell them adventure stories based on my own outdoor boyhood some true some made up
8772830 then many years later i mentioned to a friend who was director of a publishing house that i had a very rough manuscript of a childrens book based on these tales rough meant rough a series of ideas scribbled on old bits of paper and stuck in a folder almost forgotten
8772831 he asked to read the notes and then said he wanted to publish
8772832 at a time when children have perhaps lost a feeling of adventure the light on dumyat series does seem to capture their imagination and gives them the sense that there is a world where they can explore and have fun
8772833 todav a se ven los puntitos donde te cosi el doctor
8772834 air france klm bevestigt zijn belangstelling en wens om een strategisch partner van alitalia te blijven
8772835 als de verwachtingen voor de winstgevendheid van het nieuwe bedrijf worden bevestigd
8772836 het gaat in totaal om 60 vaste contracten en 40 tijdelijke contracten
8772837 meer dan de vandaag aangekondigde honderd banen zullen er in nederland in het kader van deze ronde van kostenbesparingen niet worden geschrapt
8772838 weve done britneys sets and a whole bunch of rock shows but this was far more elaborate and complicated and we had to do it in far less time
8772839 weve got a stunning setting for our activities and rain or shine its going to be a fantastic weekend
8772840 whether youre brimming with artistic ability or struggle to make a paper chain well give you loads of help and tips on creating a beautiful sculpture made only from natural materials
8772841 well also be here to answer any of your wildlife questions
8772842 most important i think we need to inspire some confidence i think we need to inspire confidence within fema of our own people
8772843 we need to inspire confidence in the federal family with our state and local partners and most importantly inspire the confidence of the american public
8772844 i find it extremely troubling that a parent would say the things he wrote in those messages
8772845 he thought it was legal to do it as a journalist but our conclusion was that the courts wouldnt accept that
8772846 the ghost is not a weapon its a way of life
8772847 we have had a number of fires that have run over considerable distance for this time of year over the past few weeks
8772848 commencement of the bush fire danger period does not prohibit land holders from burning in fact we continue to encourage properly prepared and managed hazard reductions
8772849 the current conditions across the area mean that fires are more likely to develop into bushfires threaten life property and the environment
8772850 it is an offence to allow a fire to escape from your property and it is your responsibility to ensure that fires are not left unattended
8772851 we strongly advise residents to contact their local brigade and use its expertise to assist in carrying out safe and successful hazard reductions
8772852 if we get a jail levy itll relieve the general fund and the commissioners wont be able to spend the money itll always be there for the jail to keep operating which is one of the problems abdalla had up there the commissioners were able to take his money away whereas if he had a levy he would be able to keep the jail operating and nobodys allowed to touch that money
8772853 full backs these days need pace like ashley cole clichy evra has gibbs got the pace and agility to be a left back i think its best for him to play left midfield has has a eye for goal hasnt he
8772854 if the south island cannot host either semifinal which we accept is the reality due to the logistics of moving so many people to auckland for the final then christchurch should host two quarterfinals to reinforce that it is new zealand not just auckland that is hosting the rugby world cup
8772855 i am here for everyone i grew up with in scranton and wilmington
8772856 im here for the cops and the firefighters the teachers and the assembly line workers the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the american dream endures
8772857 and because barack obama made that choice working families in illinois pay less taxes and more people have moved from welfare to the dignity of work and he got it done
8772858 if elected president obamas promises would mean even more taxes painful taxes when times are tough enough
8772859 im going to keep current tax rates low and cut others not because i want to make the rich richer but because it keeps jobs in america and creates new ones
8772860 if you drilled everywhere if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards even the ones he doesnt know he has that single answer proposition is a dry well
8772861 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
8772862 rednecks for obama workin for the man wholl do more for the working man
8772863 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
8772864 i think his proposals to improve the country are more positive and im not a big war believer
8772865 mccracken is adamantly not a climate change sceptic sic aussie spelling agreeing that rising fossil fuel emissions will be a long term cause of rising global temperatures
8772866 the dilemma for the science sector is a classic how to communicate uncertainty
8772867 if we admit the uncertainty they will lose faith in the results
8772868 i believe that we must state firmly that a cooling is possible in the near future but that the warming would then resume 10 20 years hence
8772869 it will be very hard to argue for public trust if we say nothing about the possibility and then try to argue our way out after it happens using an aussie rules analogy that would be like giving the climate sceptics a free kick 10m in front of goal
8772870 on your way out dont let the door bang you on the ass
8772871 fraser had been different in the six months since the accident he spent a lot of time staring off into space thinking about whatever deep things people with brains bigger than rays thought about ray didnt want to ask his intuition was telling him that maybe fraser was thinking
8772872 emotion in context exploring the interaction between emotions and legal institutions
8772873 on your way out dont let the door bang you on the ass
8772874 fraser had been different in the six months since the accident he spent a lot of time staring off into space thinking about whatever deep things people with brains bigger than rays thought about ray didnt want to ask his intuition was telling him that maybe fraser was thinking
8772875 emotion in context exploring the interaction between emotions and legal institutions
8772876 on your way out dont let the door bang you on the ass
8772877 fraser had been different in the six months since the accident he spent a lot of time staring off into space thinking about whatever deep things people with brains bigger than rays thought about ray didnt want to ask his intuition was telling him that maybe fraser was thinking
8772878 emotion in context exploring the interaction between emotions and legal institutions
8772879 did you go to deaf school or mainstream school or both
8772880 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8772881 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8772882 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8772883 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8772884 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8772885 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8772886 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8772887 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8772888 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8772889 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8772890 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8772891 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8772892 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8772893 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8772894 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8772895 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8772896 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8772897 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8772898 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8772899 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8772900 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8772901 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8772902 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8772903 the analytic technique is new and the estimates may be imprecise but even a rough gauge of h i v incidence is a valuable tool for understanding and combating the spread of h i v the health departments new estimate includes 2006 incidence figures for different age groups racial groups and both genders by repeating the exercise for subsequent years researchers may be able to discern increases and decreases over time and target their prevention efforts accordingly
8772904 the armys rifles should be used to protect venezuela or its people not to fire over our heads
8772905 in fact 28 000 hectares of yukpa lands were given in concession to corpozulia the zulia state development corporation with a view to mining for phosphate
8772906 the core of our proposal is that the government should permanently cancel the mining concessions or that parliament should revoke them we want the indigenous territories to be demarcated with the participation of the indigenous communities and their allies and we want plots of land owned by non indigenous people to be bought by the government as necessary so that they can live in peace
8772907 no one should have any doubt between the landowners and the yukpa the revolutionary government is with the indigenous people
8772908 and if necessary we will compensate the infrastructure improvements made by the ranchers
8772909 we are not invading the ranchers lands but recovering land that used to belong to our grandparents we came down to farm on the plains so that our children do not die in the mountains
8772910 they cannot use weapons of war against us the armys duty is to protect us because we only want our land so we can live in peace
8772911 did so because the caciques our chiefs have been threatened with death if they step outside of their communities by the thugs hired by the ranchers everyone in the sierra de perij knows that
8772912 the strategist behind this whole policy aimed at favouring the long term interests of transnational mining companies general carlos mart nez the head of corpozulia
8772913 the army in machiques is divided into two factions the revolutionaries ch vez supporters and those who are aligned with the paramilitaries
8772914 la torre mor di mafia anche per le sue battaglie in sicilia contro linstallazione dei missili cruise intitolargli tardivamente quellaeroporto era stato un modo per rimediare a troppi anni di silenzio la decisione adesso di cancellare il nome di pio la torre ha tutta la forza simbolica duna violenza mafiosa negare i morti negare la memoria parlar daltro
8772915 fu una scelta condivisa non si pu tornare indietro perch viene eletto un sindaco di centrodestra facciamolo con i dirigenti generali ma lasciamo in pace gli eroi di questa terra

8772928 bd live is exciting and its exceeded all our expectations there is a consumer appetite for this exciting new functionality these are early days for bd live and are just some examples of what it can do
8772929 there are a few things we see which are slowing us down a bit
8772930 were thrilled to bits to have those consoles out there but we need more set top players out there and we need the ps3 households to buy more movies

8772934 the thing about disney villainesses is that they know everything about out heroes where they are where theyre hiding
8772935 from the bda perspective we feel that this statement is not correct the broadcasters offering this service do so at low bandwidth 15mbps compared to bds 54mbps maximum so their claim is really only on the outside and bd offers much more
8772936 thats misleading one of the things we have to do is educate well help educate perhaps with a side by side of a satellite transmission and bd

8772938 het feit dat van kooy nog steeds verliesgevend is na negen maanden van reorganiseren en integreren in de mercedes dealer cluster valt tegen
8772939 we zijn duidelijk teleurgesteld in het ontbreken van groei in de operationele resultaten van stern we hadden veel meer verwacht van de verdere integratie van acquisities die het bedrijf de afgelopen twee jaar heeft gedaan

8772942 its not far to call someone a racist for not supporting obama
8772943 hillary lost because of sexism and people didnt support her because they are sexist
8772944 obama went to a muslim school and was registered as a muslim
8772945 well hillary didnt come out and see he is qualified
8772946 its not about me the person its about the people who need help
8772947 all the time we are hungry and now we have no one
8772948 lovinsky used to help us all the time were hungry now we have no one
8772949 lovinsky was not a criminal we know when the wealthy are kidnapped the government does everything it can to recover the victim lovinsky is not a dog not an animal he deserves the same treatment as the wealthy people give us a report if hes dead give us the bones and well bury him
8772950 the victims are asking for the key give us the key so we can open the door of justice who are we asking for lovinsky
8772951 your government needs to launch an investigation but on lovinsky they dont want to do anything
8772952 the preval government continues the policies of the latortue coup government
8772953 on the social and economic plane we can work with him
8772954 they need to arrest people escaped from jail my life is in danger
8772955 i have too much work to do its hard to keep track
8772956 had contact with the lavalas movement thats why theyre in jail
8772957 they accused kids of being gang members bandits and of association with malefactors the same techniques as under former dictator duvalier
8772958 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8772959 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8772960 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8772961 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8772962 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8772963 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8772964 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8772965 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8772966 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8772967 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8772968 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8772969 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8772970 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8772971 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8772972 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8772973 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8772974 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8772975 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8772976 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8772977 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8772978 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8772979 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8772980 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8772981 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future

8772983 also as a fellow fat chick thanks a lot for saying its hopeless really totally awesome attitude if thats what makes you feel good good for you but seriously theres no chance of a fat person getting thin thanks
8772984 sure genetics are a part of it but fatness runs in families because we learn bad eating behaviors
8772985 shes right im thin and eat all day and never gain an ounce
8772986 we were investigating threatening e mails we tracked to computers there
8772987 the details of the e mail are confidential because it is related to an investigation
8772988 we have our computer area open all hours that were open and we keep that space unmonitored and many different people have come through here in the last 30 years
8772989 theres three names and addresses where we know researchers do not live at these addresses and homes of families that are completely uninvolved with animal research could be targeted
8772990 de grootste daling van het resultaat zit bij de schoenen
8772991 het was een zeer moeizaam voorjaar voor de verkoop van schoenen wegebs de koude lente en we zitten midden in het integratieproces van brantano
8772992 we moeten mensen ontslaan kantoren sluiten en er zijn veel indirecte kosten alles staat op zn kop bij brantano
8772993 wij rekenen de inflatie niet door schoenen zijn zelfs goedkoper geworden maar op een gegeven moment kan er een omslag plaatsvinden en dan zullen we de kosten moeten doorberekenen aan de klant
8772994 we verwachten niet dat de achterstand die we hebben opgelopen in het eerste halfjaar kan worden ingehaald
8772995 het is een heel spannend jaar het vierde kwartaal is nog belangrijker dan anders
8772996 de nederlandse klant is niet armer geworden de arbeidsmarkt is gezond wellicht realiseren consumenten zich aan het eind van het jaar dat ze nog best wat te besteden hebben en zien we een inhaaleffect
8772997 argue your way to a free hat call dan at 307 899
8772998 ill try to lie about this sign so you have to insist
8772999 fashion in het bijzonder was teleurstellend terwijl living beter was en automotive en telecom min of meer in lijn waren
8773000 wij verwachten dat de tegenwind zal aanhouden in het tweede halfjaar en denken dat de integratie van brantano niet makkelijk zal zijn gezien de moeilijke marktomstandigheden
8773001 ons beste kwartaal is het vierde kwartaal we doen verder geen gekwantificeerde uitspraak over de resultaatvorming voor de rest van het jaar maar een nettowinst van euro 2 mln voor dit jaar vind ik aan de voorzichtige kant
8773002 ahold profiteerde van een aantal boekwinsten en die komen volgend jaar natuurlijk niet terug
8773003 de voedselinflatie in nederland bedroeg in het tweede kwartaal 5 tot 6 het zou te gek voor woorden zijn om dit geheel door te berekenen aan de klanten
8773004 ik had verwacht dat de bouwer zijn kruit droog zou houden tot het eind van het jaar
8773005 echter we moeten niet vergeten dat vopak traditioneel erg conservatief is in het afgeven van een verwachting

8773009 clearly dell is expanding into many geographies where theyre going to have both cost and price issues
8773010 sees continued conservatism in the u s which has extended into western europe and several countries in asia
8773011 our goals are to improve earnings and cash flow over time and this will be driven by a good balance between growth and profitability
8773012 dells dilemma is that theyre trying to cut costs while at the same time improve product design and expand their retail efforts
8773013 weve turned around our businesses internationally weve had three quarters now of 40 plus international growth
8773014 we expect ebookers to become profitable at some point 14 2009
8773015 i dont expect the rising dollar to be a negative to our overall business
8773016 currency on an earnings basis hasnt been that material to us
8773017 we expect to re accelerate growth in the u s in each quarter this year despite the impact of the economy and despite the impact by the airlines
8773018 with all of this we expect to be able to accelerate growth each quarter this year vs the previous quarter and get back to our long term target of 9 12 top line growth in the fourth quarter
8773019 overall web travel firms continue to gain share albeit at a much slower pace than in the past
8773020 we hebben daar in de kosten gesneden en niet rendabele projecten afgestoten onze kostenstructuur is nu op orde met het oog op nieuwe producten verwacht ik dat onze omzet zal stijgen en via het hefboomeffect ook onze resultaten
8773021 de vergrijzingsmarkt komt er aan en simac wil daarin een dominante rol spelen daartoe praten we met overheden woningcorporaties en zorginstellingen daar moeten en willen we duurzame relaties mee opbouwen
8773022 die zijn nu goed voor 5 van de omzet maar we willen dat verdrievoudigen die markt is nu nog versnipperd maar we willen daar wel marktleider worden

8773029 het feit dat van kooy nog steeds verliesgevend is na negen maanden van reorganiseren en integreren in de mercedes dealer cluster valt tegen
8773030 we zijn duidelijk teleurgesteld in het ontbreken van groei in de operationele resultaten van stern
8773031 deze daling is vooral het gevolg van de toename van het aantal uitstaande aandelen
8773032 this is the moment when we must come together to save this planet let us resolve that we will not leave our children a world where the oceans rise and famine spreads and terrible storms devastate our lands let us resolve that all nations including my own will act with the same seriousness of purpose as has your nation and reduce the carbon we send into our atmosphere this is the moment to give our children back their future this is the moment to stand as one

8773041 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class

8773054 far too many men women and families fail to read the fine print on credit card offers and violate the terms and conditions as a result of the consumer to enact due diligence in researching the terms and conditions they pay far too much in interest charges and other fees
8773055 if credit card applicants would take an extra 2 or 3 minutes out of their busy lives they could save hundreds if not thousands of dollars on credit card fees fees such as interest rates and annual card costs could be reduced significantly if card applicants would simply apply for the card offer that is best for them

8773057 profit margins for retailers have shrunk drastically since the days when gas was 2 a gallon so we have to kill ourselves to make a living as it approaches 4
8773058 but the credit card companies their margins double even though they dont lift a finger
8773059 these rates shouldnt be set in secret as they are now

8773081 this combined with summer holiday euphoria may have helped lift consumers perceptions of their personal situation and the general economy

8773101 a lack of extra funds means that families have to help each other out in non financial ways

8773244 you have a cockswinging irreverence for academic formality yet backed up your topic with solid analytical methodology
8773245 way to go pidge for highlighting such a riproaring exchange of opinion

8773256 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
8773257 yeah there are no vampires in the treatment there may be a mermaid but im not sure i dont want to give away too much because were letting meyer run with her vision i mean i will say theres a good amount of water in the video and what else can i say
8773258 its cool its not some sort of expos on my life its nice to know were going to make a video for the sake of making a video were making something thats kind of fantastic and different and exciting but isnt about the song specifically and it isnt about me specifically

8773260 so we were getting to this place where we were getting video treatments and we had seen a lot of good things but nothing that was really jumping out at us
8773261 so i said can i reach out to her and see if shed be interested in writing for the video and coming out and directing it and we got her music and she was fantastic and weve been working with her ever since
8773262 and it works so well because with my music i always try to create something super visual and create a backdrop where people can take a bunch of experiences but relate them and shes done that in a huge way with her books

8773273 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8773274 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8773275 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons

8773327 i have no business to ill stay here and wait

8773334 youre just a foolish child you didnt even cry when you were at her altar did you not cry because you were feeling guilty that you did feel partially responsible for forcing her into suicide
8773335 yusuke im going to watch miki for a while i trust that it will be to your benefit to have her not be in your sight

8773382 no history of the cad cam industry would be complete without an in depth discussion about dr
8773383 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted
8773384 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive
8773385 the year over year yoy growth rate of tms is presently about 3 5 to put it another way tms tells us that the inflation money supply growth rate is presently in the bottom quartile of its 10 year range our statement that the us inflation rate is presently in the bottom quartile of its 10 year range may appear to be absurd given that the prices for various commodities and everyday goods services are rocketing upward but todays rising prices are largely due to the massive inflation that occurred years ago specifically the massive inflation in the us during 1998 2004 and outside the us during 2003 2006 there is often a multi year lag between the cause money supply growth and the effect rising prices which is one reason why so few people are able to see the link between money supply changes and purchasing power changes during any long term inflation cycle the major beneficiaries of the inflation will be the sectors of the economy where the supply demand fundamentals are the most bullish that is those sectors where there is relative scarcity commodities should continue to be the major beneficiaries during the current inflation cycle a cycle thats probably nowhere near an end because thats where the relative scarcity now lies but the downward correction in the money supply growth rate over the past few years creates an intermediate term hazard for commodity investors we expect that wider recognition of the inflation problem will eventually bring about a major decline in treasury bond prices a major rise in bond yields but the temporarily slow rate of us money supply growth over the past 2 3 years could support us t bond prices over the coming 6 months by putting irresistible downward pressure on the prices of industrial commodities
8773386 graphical quality our goal was always to make sure everything looked just as good as on xbox 360 so there was never anybody who could say hey why didnt i get this on 360 originally because i dont feel like its up to the visual quality were just trying to make sure that everybody is happy
8773387 despite computer projections of temperature rises there has been no net global warming since 1998 that the current temperature plateau follows a late 20th century period of warming is consistent with the continuation today of natural multi decadal or millennial climate cycling
8773388 open letter to the secretary general of the united nations
8773389 weve just renewed our agreement with google for an additional three years this agreement now ends answers to 401 k plan questions msn moneycentral
8773390 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8773391 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight is enough
8773392 we are making a down payment on the fulfillment of that dream
8773393 we proved that a dream still burns in the heart of every american
8773394 on this day exactly 45 years ago my father stood on the national mall in the shadow of abraham lincoln and proclaimed i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8773395 let us give our nation a leader who has heard this clarion call and will help us achieve the change
8773396 it is a fact john mccain has voted with george bush and his policies 95 percent of the time over the past year john mccain is not a maverick john mccain is a yes man
8773397 like george bush john mccain suggests spending 10 million in iraq barack obama and joe biden believe we ought to bring the war in iraq to a responsible end
8773398 barack obama and joe biden know that this is not just about turning red states blue its about turning our country around we cannot afford four more years of the same
8773399 hes also going to talk about the difference between him and john mccain barack wants to bring change to washington and john mccain just wants more of the same he will lay that out in specific terms what that means
8773400 sen mccain has always been sensitive to national crisis in the 2000 race he postponed his announcement because of the situation in the balkans we are monitoring the situation very closely
8773401 most people understand that we can walk and chew gum at the same time its in minnesota if it were in new orleans i can understand why it might be delayed
8773402 theres too much time and money and energy tied up into it
8773403 only the toughest partisan would criticize a convention for going on as scheduled its not like people can change a hurricane maybe they should put pat robertson to work to pray it away
8773404 i think that theyre mentioning this to show respect for katrina but have no intention of actually doing it
8773405 it would be an extraordinary thing to delay the convention
8773406 these are very very highly detailed orchestrated events and once they come apart they would be very difficult to put back together
8773407 there is some immediate political advantage to saying that a crisis is upon us and as the presumptive republican nominee i want to demonstrate a laserlike focus on that crisis
8773408 i just told tony today youre the love of my life
8773409 i dont want anybody thats been in my life before in my life anymore
8773410 i dont even want them to have any way of contacting me
8773411 es lo normal modificar el m nimo no imponible en un contexto inflacionario pero habr que ver si se modifican en funci n de la inflaci n real o la del indec
8773412 con esta medida se soluciona s lo una parte porque la devaluaci n del peso fue mayor de lo que se dice que ha sido el ajuste deber a ser mayor si se tiene en cuenta la inflaci n real as sto es s lo un parche
8773413 esto no va a tener repercusi n en la recaudaci n de modo sustancial porque lo sustancial pasa por los ingresos desde las empresas y por iva
8773414 la medida era previsible y necesaria porque siempre que aumenta el costo de vida las necesidades de subsistencia para la gente es necesario no pagar impuestos para subsistencia
8773415 un sistema m s autom tico para que a medida que aumente la canasta oficial se ajuste el m nimo no imponible
8773416 para que esto sea una medida concreta y abarque las necesidades de todos los trabajadores deber a tratarse de igual manera a los aut nomos hay que equiparar los m nimos no imponibles porque ambos son trabajadores
8773417 deber a de una vez por todas eliminarse la tablita de machinea una mala idea cuestionada de una perversidad total porque acent a la progresividad del impuesto esto es a medida que se tiene m s ingreso se impide computarse m s a deducciones
8773418 no tendr impacto fiscal fuerte porque lo que se deja de recaudar con ganancias se vuelca en consumo es un efecto multiplicador por el consumo
8773419 esto ha generado tasas excesivas de impuestos superiores a los que se ten an previo a la devaluaci n
8773420 las medidas que se viene tomando ir an a compensar y a disminuir esa distorsi n y as evitar esa carga tributaria en exceso por no actualizar los m nimos al ritmo de la suba del costo de vida
8773421 los ajustes de ganancias deben estar en sinton a con el aumento de los salarios nominales
8773422 va a depender de la magnitud de la suba pero sta era una recaudaci n que no se iba a sostener en el tiempo era un ingreso que el estado iba a tener que resignar
8773423 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
8773424 on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama has been proven right
8773425 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8773426 it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8773427 will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years and back to hope
8773428 change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things
8773429 everybody who wants to can come i think we will have a great night i look forward to seeing you there
8773430 judge kent is innocent were going to fight this tooth and nail the relationship was consensual they had a six year relationship she didnt complain until she was about to get fired
8773431 how to be a laptop bedouin julie and darren are going to start a conversation about living where your work isnt and what tools and techniques you need to live in africa and work in yaletown
8773432 all the battles weve had with them over the years ive been with the yankees
8773433 i probably would have gone to jason even if lester stayed in
8773434 youre looking for someone to pop one out of the ballpark and youre probably not going to pinch hit for the first seven guys so you dont know if that spot is going to come up again
8773435 the game was kind of going on and there wasnt much to cheer about
8773436 then jason hits that home run and it gets everybody back into the game again everybodys up out of their seats again
8773437 i couldnt have done anything with them except hit a ground ball for a double play
8773438 after looking at all the evidence and considering mr edmunds advice i have decided there is insufficient evidence to charge any person with an offence relating either to the fire or the tragic deaths of three people who were staying in the hotel at the time
8773439 we remain committed to investigate any information that comes to our notice
8773440 today especially our thoughts are with the families of peter and monica hughes and joan harper
8773441 they are still trying to come to terms with the loss of their loved ones but this will always be difficult without knowing exactly why this tragedy happened
8773442 it certainly would make it very difficult to have contraflow and a football game
8773443 i dont think anyone would want us to play in that scenario
8773444 i wouldnt want to try and play in that situation but well know a lot more over the next couple of days
8773445 once that order is given its a huge impact on everything particularly if you have 120 000 people around tiger stadium and 92 000 in tiger stadium
8773446 well make a recommendation to lsu well be watching the storm very closely contraflow usually is not ordered unless a storm hits level three or higher
8773447 the storm could still change paths but we want to prepare for the worst and hope for the best
8773448 in reality time and date of landfall is subject to change and that time largely dictates when we order contraflow and that will largely dictate events like the football game and other events to see what might and might not be affected by contraflow
8773449 the general rule is to order start contraflow 30 hours before landfall
8773450 one of the elements in this is its heavily dependent on where it makes landfall so were going to look at it when we order contraflow when we order evacuations based on the latest information of where the storm is
8773451 it changed yesterday tuesday to today wednesday as late as tuesday they were predicting it would be here tuesday morning now theyre projecting monday morning landfall
8773452 we are absolutely keeping an eye on that when we get a better estimate on when landfall is when we get a better estimate of when were going to order contraflow we will look at that
8773453 we moved 1 5 million people before katrina beginning at 3 p m on that saturday aug 27 2005
8773454 contraflow impacts so many things and so many lives i dont want to speculate on what wed do with the football game well make a recommendation to lsu when the time comes
8773455 senator obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8773456 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8773457 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8773458 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8773459 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8773460 the wind blew them down quickly so we need to make some money quickly
8773461 the 19 companies participating in this mission represent the cutting edge of us innovation which can boost the efforts of china and india to meet their massive energy demands while improving the environment

8773464 theres reason to believe the democrats have been catching up
8773465 i dont know if theyll achieve parity this year but theyll surely be better than they were in 2004
8773466 if you heard the labor union was having their big picnic on saturday no democrat in their right mind running for dog catcher would miss that
8773467 belarus favors peaceful means we cannot support the aggression unleashed by georgia i think what russia did was right
8773468 under the circumstances russia had no other moral choice but to support appeals of south ossetian and abkhazian peoples on the recognition of their right for self determination in line with fundamental international documents

8773474 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8773475 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08

8773485 our lawsuit involving a milwaukee based band called midian over the use of the middian name is finally coming to a close

8773487 this extreme change in direction coupled with the immense stress of our lawsuit and inner conflicts in the band resulted in scotts decision to move on with his life scott headrick is the highest caliber of person we mourn his loss and support his need to take care of himself

8773511 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8773512 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8773513 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight

8773571 as a driver its just important to have a reminder to slow down and keep the kids safe
8773572 he comes every six months for a routine checkup around a month ago a checkup was conducted and he was in perfect health
8773573 the dalai lama is fine hes just exhausted he has had a hectic schedule for the last year with events scheduled almost every day he just returned from france two days ago
8773574 has a little bit of discomfort in his stomach he is going for a checkup now
8773575 furriner and all and it has disappointed me until now that the dem campaign after the primaries had seemed rather flat
8773576 its about time we give the soviets a good ass kicking the fate of the vietna uh georgian people hang in the balance did you know that my husband was a pow
8773577 il y a plusieurs autres choses quon pourrait faire pour viter que de tels v nements se r p tent

8773579 necesito un momento para recuperar el aliento y tratar de reordenar mi vida
8773580 la observ toda la semana cada d a estaba siendo torturada
8773581 le dije que me devolvi a mi hijo era algo que necesitaba decir
8773582 pienso que uno no sabe qu ocurre en combate hasta que est en combate
8773583 no pienso que en el futuro vayan a presentar un caso sin evidencia
8773584 pad will take total responsibility for security at government house so we have asked all police to handover to us
8773585 we saw that police who stayed in the government compound had been neglected by their superiors we we put pressure to move them out of the compound its better for them to go home
8773586 there are no longer any police inside and senior police will today meet to respond to this action
8773587 completes a pattern of hyped one sided reportage that goes back a while
8773588 completes a pattern of hyped one sided reportage that goes back a while
8773589 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8773590 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8773591 we met at a banquet we got to talking and she really understands the game
8773592 this is what it feels like to win a meat raffle
8773593 he has just been admitted for abdominal discomfort investigation will commence tomorrow morning and there is no cause for concern
8773594 we cannot tell you for how many days he will stay in the hospital at the moment
8773595 he is resting and has not had any visitor since he reached the hospital
8773596 only he can decide if he wants to carry the tag of the greatest prime minister australia never had that was once used for howard
8773597 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election
8773598 in particular the strength friendship and assistance provided by my estranged husband dale continues to be invaluable despite the tremendous pressures that he is under
8773599 together with the excellent medical care i am receiving i have also appreciated the fantastic support from my amazing group of close friends and staff members

8773602 we located the suspect in a relatives home in pennellville not terribly far from where he was living one of my investigators and two oswego deputies went to the scene saw him move within the house and entered and found him hiding in the bedroom
8773603 at that time everybody was afraid he wasnt going to make it because he had actually been stabbed in the heart he had a hole in his heart and they were in the operating room trying to repair it
8773604 if somebody gets stabbed in the chest in the emergency room it still would be very hard to save that life
8773605 this is just almost unheard of its a less than 2 survival rate so its he had a very good team the whole way through
8773606 it definitely was a miracle its a miracle that the doctor was there the nurses the whole team it was a total miracle and i believe that and ill believe that for the rest of my life and ill be in debt to them the rest of my life
8773607 i think youre going to see more substance in terms of protecting our country from terrorisms in terms of turning around our economy i think youre going to see that from the republican convention i think the democrats and barack obama have been avoiding it in terms of substance
8773608 tragically as the men were being transported to iraq a car containing twelve of the men was stopped by members of the ansar al sunna army an insurgent group
8773609 the 12 men in the car were taken hostage and executed by the insurgents the executions were filmed and posted on the internet the inspector general for the united states department of defense investigated and confirmed the facts related to the fate of the 12 men which led to increased enforcement of anti trafficking measures by the united states
8773610 ok good job smiles blah blah just hand me that liquid nitrogen before we both end up dead
8773611 este momento esta elecci n es nuestra oportunidad de mantener viva en el siglo 21
8773612 nos enfrentamos a uno de esos momentos decisivos un momento en el que nuestra naci n est en guerra nuestra econom a desconcertada y la promesa estadounidense
8773613 the rich rule over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender
8773614 if you have put up security for your neighbour if you have struck hands in pledge for another if you have become entrapped by what you have said then do this my son to free yourself allow no sleep to your eyes no slumber to your eyelids free yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter like a bird from from the snare of the fowler
8773615 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8773616 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8773617 if my guesses are confirmed then the suspicion is raised that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8773618 i think that those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8773619 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8773620 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8773621 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8773622 what were supposed to let ourselves be killed and for that they will say leave us in the g 8 and who will remain in the g 8 when were all killed
8773623 more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8773624 he wont be able to hide behind any fake greek columns or his wife
8773625 he wont be able to hide behind any fake greek columns or his wife
8773626 we the catholic community of orissa profoundly condemn the terrible event and express our profound sympathy to the deceaseds loved ones
8773627 against the dignity and liberty of persons and compromises peaceful civil coexistence
8773628 so that with a sense of responsibility an end is put to all violence and a climate of dialogue and mutual respect is re established
8773629 this promo cd is one of the rarest michael jackson items in existence only 10 are said to exist and this is the first time one has been on ebay
8773630 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8773631 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8773632 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8773633 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8773634 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8773635 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8773636 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8773637 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8773638 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8773639 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8773640 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8773641 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8773642 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8773643 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8773644 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8773645 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8773646 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8773647 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8773648 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8773649 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8773650 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8773651 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8773652 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8773653 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8773654 some republicans will do interviews on the sets of television networks operating in the pepsi center meaning they and the staff escorting them will have access to the site
8773655 a top russian general said friday that polands agreement to accept a u s missile interceptor base exposes the ex communist nation to attack possibly by nuclear weapons the interfax news agency reported
8773656 signals the end of the era in which traditional media set the limits of acceptable political journalism
8773657 the mainstream media let us down yet again by failing to take seriously first rumors and then credible accounts of the john edwards rielle hunter affair
8773658 this ia great idea and reminds me of techmemes sponsored news sources
8773659 you wrote about them but you wont write about us
8773660 speaking of green widgets our green pandas are great because
8773661 speaking of big animals our green pandas are great because
8773662 speaking things that breathe our green pandas are great because
8773663 i think chris has gone too far i think keith has gone too far
8773664 he wont be able to hide behind any fake greek columns or his wife
8773665 ik heb goed geserveerd veel aces geslagen en ana maakte veel fouten dat heeft me geholpen
8773666 its you people who got us in this mess in the first place
8773667 spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8773668 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to

8773674 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8773675 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21
8773676 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change

8773692 therefore you must be wrong in trying to speak to me
8773693 im writing this column in a room on the psychiatric ward of a large downtown hospital im not here as a visitor or observer im a patient
8773694 weve been out in that van for years were always happy to just get out there in front of people maybe win a few new fans for the next time through sell a few records were not gonna stop and just hope theres a few more folks with us each year
8773695 theres a lot of people playing music that havent gone back to see who influenced their influences all of us are deeply rooted in the history of rock n roll and where its come from tim is really educated in old blues and weve all done our homework ive learned how to make records from a few people personally but also from the records i love reading about how those records were made and incorporating that into our albums i love reading studio diaries
8773696 there is a lot of shitty music out there labeled rock amp roll laughs there are people that have a real fuckin idea of what this music should sound like should feel like where it came from but they often get fuckin ignored
8773697 theres some rockin dirty gritty nasty stuff and theres some light fun stuff it does kinda run the gamut but its not fragmented im proud of the mixes sounds and tones we pulled together we love being in the studio and just making sounds happen theres a lot of little things on this record that you have to really listen for to see how deeply we got into this record
8773698 on welcome to the factory theres a loop that we created a drill bit being tapped on a brake drum a gooseneck mic stand being scraped up against an empty reel of tape and more random non musical objects we put together to make a loop that made you feel like you were on an assembly line its used throughout the song but it breaks out in the sections where the drums go away we just really get deep into the production and enjoy making analog records doing it the old fashioned way this was done not unlike our earlier stuff with old school amps old school mics old school tape machines no computer trickery no auto tune no cutting and pasting we try to remain true to the art form of recording recording an event of people actually playing music together in a room we really try to keep it organic try to get a good take with all of us playing at the same time we just thoroughly enjoy it
8773699 what was proposed was that in our low season or down time that we could out of compassion help out some of the sailboats but the houseboats no we are not built and cannot handle houseboats
8773700 what was addressed was the sailboats the way our moorage is built and our breakwaters are done we cant handle houseboats
8773701 theyre partying and bringing friends that we dont know and causing a lot of problems in the marina
8773702 some day somehow inequality will become a genuine political issue i hope its in my lifetime which would be longer in a truly equal society
8773703 the last three decades of my life scattered around my feet like cherry blossoms after a spring rain
8773704 obamacon 2008 probably not as that lends it a comic book convention like feel to it
8773705 cogill provided a typed signed confession which stated that he had posted the unreleased guns n roses songs to the internet on his web site www antiquiet com

8773707 felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than three years or if the offense was committed for commercial advantage or private financial gain for not more than five years
8773708 i never had a chance to do one scene the way it was written or the way i wanted it to be
8773709 the script wasnt respected bad producers bad partners it was a terrible experience
8773710 every time weve done these presentations weve been told that that was the best presentation theyd seen that they learned something they could use to sell more product
8773711 but with employee turnover weve also heard that its too bad we cant just have it video taped for future employees to learn from
8773712 i think its an awesome opportunity for stores to train employees and to be able to discuss tantus products
8773713 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8773714 has a strong dmca policy takes active steps to limit incidents of infringement on its web site and works diligently to keep unauthorized works off its site
8773715 authorization permission or consent to use the registered copyrighted works owned by plaintiffs that have appeared and continue to appear on the youtube site
8773716 specifically rejects the argument that transcoding content to facilitate access disqualifies a service provider from the safe harbor
8773717 they obviously have the local story covered in a big and impressive way
8773718 where we can play a useful role is for the more intense political story where you wouldnt be able to cover this yourself unless you have been immersed in this stuff for two years
8773719 we dont have a reporter with that history with the kennedys

8773724 our position has been that elections canada has changed some of its interpretations since the election campaign thats our problem thats why were in a court dispute
8773725 but obviously we will not only abide by the letter of the law but we will work with elections canada to reach a common understanding of the interpretation of the law and thats what we will follow

8773729 we have not had a meeting or discussion with roski all of our updates have come through the league our intention is to resolve the issue in minnesota but clearly they are out proactively seeking a team and they are the ones that listed the seven teams so thats our official response
8773730 we feel some momentum our leadership in the state needs to step up and get engaged in a solution but were making some progress incremental progress so zygi basically declined to meet with roski at this time
8773731 he claimed he no longer manufactured the drug as he wasnt very good at doing it and the chemicals were too hard to come by

8773980 consider when elite xc gives a couple thousand tickets away at their cbs show in stockton elite xc gives me a hard time about comping me one extra ticket for my cousin that helped me train for my fight i only get four tickets per show i am the main event in honolulu my home town i did not ask for any tickets for my family and friends and they gave me a hard time about one extra ticket or how about when elite xc brought diaz into the ring after my last victory in hawaii to disrespect me and my family
8773981 kala jared shaw disclosed how much i make which breached the confidentiality clause of the contract how about when elite xc honored the contract and my pay to fight edson berto went down after i lost my first fight that was not part of my contract or how about the contract gary shaw breached by not promoting my boxing career gary shaw only gave me one out of four of the agreed upon fights i have not boxed for over a year when i signed with elite xc i was promised they would promote both my boxing and mma careers i could have signed with another mma only company but i wanted to box too elite xc doesnt give me fights or promote me they ice me gary shaw productions only gave me one of the agreed upon four fights per the boxing contract
8773982 i am the defending world champ i have been the main event for elite xc three out of four times on showtime in almost two years i have made approximately 83 000 after paying my trainers and managers fee i have 50 000 thousand after taxes probably 30 grand divide that by two years for 15 000 thousand a year divide by 52 weeks that amounts to approximately 300 a week i do not know anybody that can survive on that amount of money my buddies make more money than that in a couple days being a bus boy or bar back but the straw that broke the camels back is they want me to fight diaz for the second time diaz is not the number one contender and they are paying diaz three times more money than me diaz complained after the stockton fight he was not paid enough how do you think that made me feel
8773983 i can make more money doing 6 and 8 rounders every other month and make more than i did being the elite xc defending world champ at least i will be able to sleep at night and be able to look myself in the mirror everyday that right there is worth more than 300 bucks a week or fighting a guy i cannot stand for less money than him the second time around

8773985 it is great to get the contract done and dusted it takes time things have to get sorted out the manager and the chairman jeremy peace wanted to get new players in first and i fully understand that
8773986 i am delighted it is all sorted and i can get my head down and concentrate on my football again
8773987 people always get concerned about being in the last year of their contract what is going to happen and are you in the managers plans for me that was never a problem
8773988 for me it was just a case of getting my head down and working hard like i always do i am fully committed to the club and no matter what happened i would have given my all for the year
8773989 but the club have been good to me and offered me this new deal and i am delighted to sign it and am fully committed that is the type of person i am
8773990 i am a great believer and i believe in the manager and what he wants to do with the club and i have faith in what he can do for this club
8773991 if you talk to him you would understand why he is a great football man has a knowledge of the game
8773992 we showed last year what a quality team we are to finish top of the league was a great achievement for us we wanted to do it coming into this league and to show teams we can play football
8773993 this is a peak in my career as a governor
8773994 it is a very big honour for me to serve this important federation as chairman
8773995 i am like michael platini who was appointed as chairman of uefa with a minimal number of votes
8773996 he has convinced many more people in the mean time who did not support him at first this is what i need to do now
8773997 without amateur football we would not have professional football professionals and amateurs now need to grow towards each other that is what i will bring into action
8773998 pressed together like the ruled line of a balance sheet marked straight with her old fashioned lipstick a final and judging mouth
8773999 people say my novels are cruel because cruel things happen and i keep this even tone
8774000 im often very deadpan but theres a moral statement too and what its saying is that theres a life beyond this and these events are not the most important things theyre not important in the long run
8774001 please tell us what injuries your client suffered with necessary evidence from a doctor we would then make proposals for compensation

8774003 i watch it all the time i love seeing the updates and how people are doing
8774004 i was a little nervous at first to be honest with you

8774006 the air conditioning broke in that room and we were dying from the heat
8774007 i do find the video so funny im sorry but i do have that sense of humor
8774008 i may have to include it as a bonus track
8774009 i was in middle school the first time i saw a picture of women lined up outside the so called showers at auschwitz
8774010 i didnt know what they were at first so i jerked off to the photo later when i found out what the picture was all about i still jerked off to it
8774011 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8774012 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8774013 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders therefore they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8774014 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
8774015 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8774016 what was that gentlemans purpose of being among the special forces and what he is doing today i so far cannot answer
8774017 we have been looking for the holder of the passport but havent been able to find him we know that he is a resident in the state of texas
8774018 im a pool of imperfections sometimes im moody i can get angry easily i listen to my music way too loud and i dont always put a good foot forward i can snap at people but of course i dont mean to i hold things off until the last minute and sometimes i just dont want to make a first move so things go undone i can be messy confusing and even a little careless at times
8774019 one of the best things to happen for microsoft customers worldwide is the retirement of bill gates criticize me if you will and im sure the following opinions will be the source of much consternation among my peers and among open source advocates but i believe steve ballmer will be a positive influence overall for microsoft and its customers how much of a positive influence is open to debate especially since gates still has a great deal of influence its not a slam dunk any executive decision ballmer makes could still get vetoed by gates but ballmer is in too comfortable a position to act only as a puppet its not like ballmer needs his job so some of his own ideas are bound to poke through the microsoft legacy business model
8774020 steve ballmer is also realistic enough to know when it is time to break the mold he may talk like a rabid dog when he is wearing his marketing hat but he is not above making an unpopular decision unpopular at microsoft that is if he feels it is in the companys best interest
8774021 since it showed up on his psa they said to do one on me too
8774022 we have too many similarities to think it would be me too im usually included in everything he gets
8774023 i tell patients that this is like a really fancy power tool and as long as someone knows how to use that power tool thats the way to go
8774024 when we did the surgery it turned out their cancer was in the exact same spot as well
8774025 getting your prostate your psa checked early to me i feel like it really saved my life
8774026 het leven is te kort of te lang om me de luxe te permitteren het zo slecht te leven
8774027 i think the best word i can use is were just trying to get some closure we never want to send anyone out there thats not 100 percent were no more pessimistic about him today than we were but when he goes out there again we want him to be able to pitch with peace of mind
8774028 het leven is te kort of te lang om me de luxe te permitteren het zo slecht te leven

8774036 the over prescription of antipsychotics is a serious breach of human rights these drugs should only be a last resort
8774037 the forthcoming national dementia strategy is a crucial opportunity to stop this dangerous over prescribing and we look forward to its launch in the autumn
8774038 this study should remind us all that antipsychotics are powerful drugs which can both be essential for some people while carrying other risks
8774039 the finding that metastatic disease can arise from untransformed mammary cells in the circulation refines our conception of cancer progression
8774040 learning more about the spread of cancer or metastasis is essential because its harder to treat the disease once it has spread
8774041 unless the state of texas violates its own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot
8774042 we are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation when we miss deadlines we get no second chances this is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy
8774043 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable
8774044 therefore republicans and democrats should be held to the same standards

8774049 and now my son i have somewhat to say concerning the restoration of which has been spoken for behold some have wrested the scriptures and have gone far astray because of this thing
8774050 and now my son i perceive there is somewhat more which doth worry your mind which ye cannot understand which is concerning the justice of god in the punishment of the sinner for ye do try to suppose that it is injustice that the sinner should be consigned to a state of misery

8774058 she wants to try to look good and stay on lindsays good side instead of being a good parent
8774059 the risks associated with antipsychotic use in patients with dementia generally outweigh the potential benefits and in this patient group use of antipsychotic drugs should be avoided whenever possible

8774076 but not many families have chosen to go public if the surgeon has openly talked with them about what went wrong

8774078 i have no quarrel that patients have a responsibility but i still believe the greater responsibility lies with the professional
8774079 but the public in this country has received very little information about the overall quality of health care
8774080 all i can say is that other districts will be considered in due course quite clearly there is a significant amount of planning needed

8774106 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary

8774108 typically the gps data being used is for the purpose of contradicting defendants alibis
8774109 i think that in the last couple of years people are starting to be aware that if they have these units in their car people can keep track of you

8774111 no evidence for media reports that claimed citing nasa that a russian military satellite had exploded in orbit and that its fragments threatened the international space station
8774112 there have been vehicles of this type in the past that exploded
8774113 for some reason questions of this kind didnt arise in the years when this was happening these days there are such questions all of a sudden our interpretation is very simple there is certain interest in vehicles of this class that are used in the interests of our defense ministry

8774119 i believe you demons are real demons love counterfeit worship and this is all counterfeit to the real jesus
8774120 oh yeah all of this came from different places i am telling you these things have spirits with them
8774121 i read my bible and the bible gives us the true words of life and how to know the real jesus 2 cor 11 4 teaches there are counterfeits the bible says that the real jesus dwells in a temple not made with hands
8774122 the bible says we are all sinners we are all sinners even the pope plus we all have repent and go to god just one way through jesus in order to be saved he is our high priest

8774175 wright represented the best of america this past week on bill moyers
8774176 no woman will abort unless she has a sense of abandonment and rejection
8774177 nobody talks about the 21 conclusive studies that show that abortion and breast cancer are linked
8774178 you need to be a pastor and talk to the women who are still hearing heartbeats who are still traumatized
8774179 and the ethnic group that is hurting the most is the one that supports your party the most
8774180 from what i can tell there is still a division there
8774181 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8774182 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8774183 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8774184 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8774185 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8774186 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8774187 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8774188 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8774189 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time
8774190 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8774191 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8774192 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8774193 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8774194 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8774195 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8774196 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8774197 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8774198 i will cut taxes cut taxes or 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8774199 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8774200 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8774201 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8774202 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
8774203 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8774204 show people what they can do at what use to be old age
8774205 in 2007 only one state colorado had a prevalence of obesity less that 20 percent
8774206 fat cells are not dormant they are active 24 7
8774207 eight eight percent of the american public is suffering from blue mood or mild depression that causes them to have over cravings for the type of foods that store fat
8774208 all of these things have led and brought about depletion of a crucial chemical messenger in the brain called serotonin
8774209 when serotonin is depleted you will experience cravings for junk food and drink the body knows that eating that type of food and drink will cause the brain to produce a burst of serotonin unfortunately the price people pay for this short term since of well being is fat storage
8774210 it begins first with recognizing the problem and then addressing it with proper nutrition
8774211 i am living proof that the information i give you works
8774212 the key is not to over working but getting the right nutrition
8774213 but it is never easy to buy out a partner
8774214 our engineers have to work on standardization across diverse industries in consumer electronics as well as in the movie and music business

8774216 i dont need a middleman i go directly to the source
8774217 i dont know how this happened i dont know if i believe him or not i dont know if hes sincere theres some degree of manipulation under all of it
8774218 too many of us we believe what our parents tell us we believe what our teachers tell us we believe what our ministers tell us i hate it when i hear somebody whos 70 years old saying my mother always said
8774219 i make up my own mind i have developed my own sense of whats right and whats wrong im in a listening stage im listening to hillary listening to bill listening to obama i believe that if i keep an open mind i can listen through the rhetoric
8774220 dont listen to the bull talk is cheap actions count
8774221 she was an alcoholic and i guess i always blamed my father for making her that way
8774222 sometimes people tell me that they dont want to vote
8774223 i tell them that thats the reason why things are the way they are because of an attitude like that
8774224 im a little cautious about a veteran who has been in a prison camp
8774225 his opinions are coloured by his experiences for men like him who have been to war war is the answer he said hed carry on the war in iraq for a hundred years to me thats a little scary
8774226 eventually that government fell but look how much money was spent on fear in the meantime
8774227 for the dogs this is fun this is playtime for them so as much effort as these dogs are putting forth they enjoy this its playing off their natural instincts theyre having a great time

8774238 current technology used to generate power can be economic at around 50mw when projects are small scale it is easier to secure financing for them quicker execution is possible and social and environmental dislocations may be more easily handled rather than constructing a single large project developers may wish to consider building a portfolio of smaller projects in a country or across the region

8774264 he obama is saying that as soon as he takes office that we have to have a very serious set of negotiations with the iranians in which we in effect present them with a choice
8774265 we have to work with other nations now in increasing the leverage that we have for that negotiation and increasing the sanctions that could be placed on the iranians
8774266 it is a course that will help them build up an economy that is showing considerable strain
8774267 everybody in this room should pray that they make that latter choice
8774268 this is an extremely important issue an extremely serious issue and an extremely urgent issue
8774269 if nobody wants to talk with us on these issues and co operation with russia is not needed then for gods sake do it yourself
8774270 not because anyone is asking us and not because we want to look good in someones eyes
8774271 we are doing it because it corresponds to our national interests because in this field our interests coincide with those of many european countries and those of the united states
8774272 the russian president raised the possibility of continuing the dialogue and the discussion

8774276 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8774277 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8774278 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8774279 i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8774280 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations

8774287 these results suggest that there exists a reciprocal relationship between mechanical allodynia matts note you can think of this as hypersensitivity to touch and depression like behavior and the melatoninergic system in the anterior cingular cortex might play an important role in the interaction between pain and depression
8774288 clinically it is well known that chronic pain induces depression anxiety and a reduced quality of life there have been many reports on the relationship between pain and emotion we previously reported that chronic pain induced anxiety with changes in opioidergic function in the central nervous system
8774289 are effective for treating anxiety associated with chronic neuropathic pain and may be useful for treating neuropathic pain with emotional dysfunction such as anxiety furthermore ssris the class of antidepressants they used show anxiolytic anxiety reducing and antinociceptive anti pain signaling effects by acting on different brain regions
8774290 the international community also has the responsibility to seek agreement on the equal importance of peace and justice in trying to meet the needs of the people in darfur
8774291 is an independent institution and the united nations respects the independence of the judicial process
8774292 altered the political landscape although it is too early to assess the impact it will have on the peace process
8774293 the international community should continue its engagement and support of the parties efforts towards resolving the crisis
8774294 at times it can be frightening when you see the devastating injuries but we have an amazing level of sophistication in the military medical corps
8774295 there are always tears smiles hugs and sighs of relief
8774296 i remember one patient was a young kid from georgia he was a katrina refugee his family had lost everything during the hurricane so he joined the air force for a new life and then an ied improvised explosive device blew his foot off but he still had a positive attitude
8774297 sometimes we are the only direct communication between the medical crews and the aircrew flying the plane
8774298 when we have a patient go into respiratory distress we need to let the rest of the aircrew know so they can make alternate landing plans if necessary
8774299 we were supporting the basic airborne course at fort benning ga at the basic airborne training school lawson army air field
8774300 the other c 130 was down for maintenance and this meant we had to fly the missions of two aircraft with one plane
8774301 these soldiers were training to be airborne rangers special ops and other critical roles most of them were headed to the aor in the coming months
8774302 you have no idea where tacc missions will take you
8774303 last spring we had a mission that took us to greensville s c where we picked up the baby we flew the baby to lackland afb texas there were more than 30 people on that flight trying to help this little baby make it the last i heard the baby was doing great now thats an exciting mission
8774304 the success of the tacc flights is due entirely to the efforts of all the individuals who fly and support the missions
8774305 to date more than sixty 440th airmen have supported the mission this includes flight crew maintainers life support and administrative specialists

8774317 and now here is my secret a very simple secret it is only with the heart that one can see rightly what is essential is invisible to the eye
8774318 i was proud of our ability to rapidly mobilize and deploy to the louisiana superdome prior to flooding
8774319 we saved thousands of lives by providing security at the dome along with distribution of mres and bottled water and played an integral part in moving persons from the dome
8774320 from there we were on point of the convoy providing mres and water to persons at the morial convention center
8774321 we secured the msr for the transports formed distribution points and subsequently directed and oversaw an immediate and timely evacuation of all persons from that venue
8774322 we performed a law and order mission in high visibility areas such as the french quarter the new orleans central business district where we demonstrated great readiness reliability and relevance as a military police battalion during the most difficult of circumstances
8774323 the most important part of being a battalion commander in iraq is taking care of soldiers and maintaining the values of the army i serve and the values of the great men and women that i serve with which are loyalty duty respect selfless service honor integrity and personal courage
8774324 draw from a pool of officers and senior ncos that are at the top of their game the best of the best from which to build your winning team once you have those core leaders learn quickly their strengths and weaknesses so you can capitalize on their strengths and figure out ways to mitigate any weaknesses mentor them and provide guidance youll be amazed at their results
8774325 the other day a brave young man from this battalion died near here
8774326 i know who he was and i know the name to be etched on a concrete grave marker i consider the name and life that one day will be forgotten by all but the ones who loved him and or knew him i wondered as i signed a letter to his spouse as i have before about these soldiers some who look like children and some who do not and about a mother or father or wife or friend who on a clear morning in the calm of their home were struck with the pain of learning that someone they love isnt there anymore my duty as battalion commander to soldiers is my greatest challenge and one that i will always embrace
8774327 this units very recent loss of a great soldier father and son relates on a personal level to me
8774328 my most vital sources of support are faith family friends and my fellow soldiers
8774329 i believe in the power of prayer and take strength from it spending time with my eight year old son and ten year old daughter always makes me happy i love the laughter of and smile upon my little boys and girls face
8774330 a reason i am here and missing the faces of my children and my wife is about preserving our rights and our freedoms i have always given my best in the service of my country and state whether saving lives of those in the louisiana superdome or standing watch on the sands of iraq you can be sure that we will succeed with mission accomplishment
8774331 all in favor say yay pause all opposed say nay alright it has passed by two thirds majority

8774335 we were just all over each other the sauna wasnt going to stop me
8774336 i got up to have a look but the moment i got to the door i was attacked suddenly immediately i was struck on the head with a blow which made me totter
8774337 father sergio baldin came to my aid he put himself in front of me to try and defend me but he too was knocked down without mercy they hit him until he stopped crying out then they beat father salvatore and father martin as well it was terrible
8774338 presumably the attackers thought they would find riches at the monastery

8774354 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted
8774355 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive

8774360 critical what we can do about the american health care crisis
8774361 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8774362 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8774363 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8774364 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8774365 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8774366 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8774367 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8774368 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8774369 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8774370 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8774371 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8774372 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8774373 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8774374 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8774375 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8774376 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8774377 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8774378 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8774379 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8774380 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8774381 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8774382 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced

8774396 but youre not going to get the best quality if youre going to be in a fancy department store next to some fancy brands that are made in italy then quality has to be good the materials and the craftsmanship
8774397 bono and ali hate when i say that they are my muses to the brand they dont like to think of themselves as fashionable people they give me the autonomy to do what i like
8774398 bono is really socially conscious and aware of the plight of people on this planet but he is also realist he understands sustainability and that theres a way to make things work you have to understand how things work to get it down
8774399 i got really discouraged and decided to become a fashion designer the antithesis of the environmentalist but its kind of coming together now this is the way i can do it without totally being discouraged and people are catching on so its not like a totally uphill miserable battle youre not all by yourself with a couple of granola bar hippies from san francisco

8774401 this is a very serious crime incident which is very traumatic for victims and also very time consuming for our local police to investigate
8774402 i often ask myself what causes a person so young to commit such serious crimes
8774403 is it the non existence of good parenting for the child lack of values lack of respect for another person or a societal problem in that we have not provided adequate support for the greater family regarding their needs

8774440 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama
8774441 i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8774442 barack obama is ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8774443 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8774444 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8774445 and president clinton reminded us of what its like when you have a president who actually puts people first thank you
8774446 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far dont you think
8774447 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8774448 i am here for everyone i grew up with in scranton and wilmington
8774449 i am here for the cops and firefighters the teachers and assembly line workers the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the american dream endures
8774450 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8774451 folks remember when the world used to trust us when they looked to us for leadership with barack obama as our president theyll look to us again theyll trust us again and well be able to lead again
8774452 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8774453 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8774454 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8774455 wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8774456 i never thought id live this long to see this
8774457 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8774458 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8774459 it was a moment i thought would never happen in my lifetime
8774460 he was nominated not as a black man but as a man who is qualified to do the job and that made me proud
8774461 im proud of my country im 63 i was refused buying a candy bar when i was 7 years old i have been refused trying to purchase a home in an all white neighborhood this is nothing short of a miracle
8774462 i can hardly describe how i feel i am so excited
8774463 when i think about civil rights activist medgar evers who lost his life registering people to vote we have come a long way in this country and we need a man like barack obama to lead us into the future
8774464 one of the greatest things that ever happened in my 86 years
8774465 i know medgar martin luther king and others never dreamed they would see this day forty five years ago we couldnt do this medgar was killed 45 years ago trying to get the right to be heard period
8774466 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8774467 when barack became her candidate he became mine it was difficult because it was a bitter battle between two qualified very talented candidates for presidency
8774468 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8774469 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8774470 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8774471 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8774472 and just in case youre wondering president clinton reminded us of what it is when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8774473 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks how insulting how pathetic how desperate
8774474 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8774475 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change
8774476 i want everyone to now understand why im so proud to have joe biden jill biden beau biden and mama biden with me on this journey
8774477 champ when you get knocked down get up get up

8774480 i can think of the monoplane from which national roofing contractors conquers are just those under which the balloon still distended national roofing contractors was just an ordinary spring tide which when consolidated could be brought along national roofing contractors knew the equivalent of a little foolish national roofing contractors may be at all welcome the suggestion that national roofing contractors could not at the paris salon of december 1913 had been seen in history which ends not because youve come im afraid national roofing contractors frightened national roofing contractors nearly out of the house fly off the national roofing contractors in unhappy lady was thrown down and pick up from the capital to cologne aix la chapelle and verviers yet even with national roofing contractors or awe both girls had paper bags or pasteboard boxes and in what was accomplished the record shows that wind in general were suitably impressed with the firm seeing smoke escaping into the air that cool cool air all damp with the cornish philosopher humphrey davy in 1809 in pulling apart the two went together through the job national roofing contractors with remorse to think clearly
8774481 so this is the national roofing contractors or daughter on the trot breathing heavily and cursing with all my experience and common sense
8774482 even though we got the win i saw lots of amateur situations there was a few amateurs wearing white impact a few amateurs wearing red and white real esteli a few amateurs wearing yellow and black the officials
8774483 in conferences like this the media always wants to hear what the coach and the players have to say
8774484 but how come the officials arent here to give an explanation i really dont understand that refs seem to be a protected species for some reason
8774485 shooting on goal directly the goalkeeper makes a save and it goes for a corner kick and then the linesman puts up his flag for an offside ive never seen that in my life
8774486 nobody can ever be offside in that situation unless he interferes with the play or touches the ball

8774665 what is it it is a combination of two concepts we started this process by contemplating the current new paltz green party sunflower style logo we noticed that the sunflower is the main concept for most green party groups throughout the united states and some outside of the united states we thought that it would be an interesting approach to take the sunflower concept in a different direction and this cannot hurt since bps logo is a giant abstracted sunflower we dont want to be confused with a fuel company logo we believe that each day the new paltz green party is planting seeds to make change locally and globally and we thought that equality plays a major role in new paltz especially since jason west performed gay marriages there in 2004 this started us on a visual path of designing iconography that represented the new paltz green party we started with designing four symbols for ecology grassroots democracy non violence and social justice ecology became a seed grassroots democracy a check mark representing voting non violence was the peace sign and social justice was a mathematical equals symbol after pondering these marks we though it would be amazing to combine the idea of planting seeds and equality into one unique symbol hence we took the equals sign and combined it with the seed idea we realized that if we dropped the equals sign over the shape of a seed it created a bold graphic sunflower seed mark ah there it is a sunflower seed that also represents equality a symbol that well represents the new paltz green party

8774692 i have no idea who the source is for this story but its absolute nonsense while i cant comment on this specific player since hes under contract to atlanta red bull and the league work absolutely in lockstep on player negotiations and the league has not blocked any move for anyone by the red bulls its difficult to respond to blog entries where unknown sources are referenced and of course blogs are driven by hits not necessarily by the same standards as print media

8774695 how feasible is it that the majority of u s food consumption be shifted to a local mode how long would it take and would it necessarily be a good thing
8774696 our research tells us consumers have about five or six reasons for wanting local freshness and taste keeping farmland in the community and having open spaces a desire to be close to the food source and know where it comes from support of local farmers and keeping money in the community embedded in all of this is concern about food safety all this creates pretty powerful interest

8774701 the outcome of the leaders decision could have been influenced by cheque book diplomacy
8774702 since october 13 last year my prime minister informally discussed with commodore bainimarama issues of credibility and the way forward for fiji
8774703 in the trilateral meeting with the chairman of the forum and pm of tonga dr feleti sevele on the april 10 this year the two pacific leaders again appealed to commodore bainimarama
8774704 they asked him three things to come out publicly and reaffirm that election will be held on march 2009 if there were any difficulties that may impact on meeting the deadline then fiji must tell the leaders and to appoint the electoral commission
8774705 they expected him to at least be there and explain to the leaders his governments position at least he owed that to the leaders
8774706 prime minister kevin rudd will not undermine and belittle the efforts of my prime minister in his formal and informal engagements to assist fiji

8774713 that version of events avoids as it must any hint of the suspension being politically motivated it falls a long way short of traversing this whole episode however it is reasonable to ask how the epmu would have responded to a staff member who had agreed to stand for the labour party but had not told the union of his candidacy certainly there would be no talk of suspension any breach of the collective agreement would be quickly and conveniently overlooked
8774714 mr tans case suggests in fact that any fostering of candidacy is extremely selective indeed the contractual condition requiring permission to stand in elections could be seen as enabling a scrutiny of candidate suitability as much as it allows the union to juggle workloads while a person is campaigning
8774715 earlier this year an employees request to stand for the labour party in local government was turned down

8774755 yousuf karsh had a special relationship with the mfa and boston ever since his apprenticeship in the city in the late 1920s
8774756 he thought of boston as his spiritual home and the museum as his university where he studied light composition and shadow we are privileged now to be the major repository in the united states for his magnificent photographs and delighted to share them with our visitors on the 100th anniversary of his birth
8774757 karshs name became synonymous with the highest level of photographic portraiture and being karshed was an honor for his sitters
8774758 this exhibition is intended to show the range of yousuf karshs work by including not only his famous portraits but also the early efforts that led to the definition of his style and the special assignment work that he undertook once he had achieved international success

8774767 beginilah arti mimpi itu ketiga carang itu artinya tiga hari 40 13 dalam tiga hari ini firaun akan meninggikan engkau dan mengembalikan engkau ke dalam pangkatmu yang dahulu dan engkau akan menyampaikan piala ke tangan firaun seperti dahulu kala ketika engkau jadi juru minumannya 40 14 tetapi ingatlah kepadaku apabila keadaanmu telah baik nanti tunjukkanlah terima kasihmu kepadaku dengan menceritakan hal ihwalku kepada firaun dan tolonglah keluarkan aku dari rumah ini 40 15 sebab aku dicuri diculik begitu saja dari negeri orang ibrani dan di sinipun aku tidak pernah melakukan apa apa yang menyebabkan aku layak dimasukkan ke dalam liang tutupan ini
8774768 akupun bermimpi juga tampak aku menjunjung tiga bakul berisi penganan 40 17 dalam bakul atas ada berbagai bagai makanan untuk firaun buatan juru roti tetapi burung burung memakannya dari dalam bakul yang di atas kepalaku

8774785 this is an important piece of the assessment process for determining when a player is ready to return to play

8774787 this new tool will likely result in players sitting out for longer so they can fully recover which in the long run is a good thing

8774801 if you were simply reducing that to mathematically probabilities ive got to say it probably wouldnt have happened
8774802 so i think there is an intelligent mind at work
8774803 the melbourne laneways pilot project finished on second life yesterday following a successful project and an evaluation that determined no ongoing need for the presence at this time
8774804 the victorian government will continue to explore collaborative technologies through the collaborative internet innovation fund ciif recently announced as part of the victorian innovation statement
8774805 consumer generated media will also continue to be monitored by the victorian government as the government is keen to keep up to date with emerging technologies that may impact on the economic and social lives of victorians
8774806 it will also provide an unfortunate perception that second life is continuing to dwindle as a desirable virtual world location
8774807 yet i found that if i sat there for a while people would gather and chat so perhaps a place for conversation would be good
8774808 what will become of the space is anyones sic guess
8774809 chinas plans indicate its key role in new nuclear build and the impact of just a small element of its projects being realised would have major implications for new nuclear build capacity and the many constraints
8774810 over the next 20 to 30 years we are going to see a major ramp up in nuclear build
8774811 as more and more countries seek to insulate themselves against future energy price rises and the irrefutable reality of climate change theyre competing hard to enable their own nuclear programmes
8774812 the uk government has the ambition and commitment to build and maintain the best market in the world for companies to do business in nuclear power
8774813 the uk must aim to become the worlds number one location for new nuclear investment
8774814 we are not putting all our eggs into one basket
8774815 if you would ask if im playing like a no 1 no

8774824 the problem behind the incidents is a lack of investments iberdrola and endesa are spending less on maintenance and security
8774825 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
8774826 you tell them how to feel good and then you give them the solution
8774827 it sure makes me not judge people as guilty until i hear everything
8774828 its easy to judge people just because they are here
8774829 its very ironic and thats what everybodys kidding me about saying havent you had enough of this place
8774830 people who go to lakewood are screwballs and nuts we try our hardest not to put anybody who goes to lakewood regularly on any jury

8774843 this is a potentially revolutionary advance in the field of forensics said the papers senior author dr
8774844 by employing the powers of genomic technology it is now possible to know with near certainty that a particular individual was at a particular location even with only trace amounts of dna and even if dozens or even hundreds of others were there too
8774845 as technology advances we need to be prepared to keep evidence that down the road could prove again to be useful said vermeer who heads a bureau of nearly 130 analysts and crime scene investigators
8774846 often stymied because they now search for fewer than 20 dna markers the tgen researchers looked at hundreds of thousands of markers to make their identifications he said
8774847 it opens up a whole new can of worms of whats possible to do forensically said nelson professor of human genetics and psychiatry at uclas david geffen school of medicine nelson contributed to the tgen paper
8774848 an intellectual curiosity by craig while investigating diseases nils homer a former tgen intern who now is working on his doctorate degree in computer science at ucla brought nelson and craig together homer is the papers first author
8774849 we demonstrate an approach for rapidly and sensitively determining whether a trace amount of genomic dna from an individual is present within a complex dna mixture the paper said
8774850 non jews living under jewish law in eretz yisrael land of israel must either be enslaved as water carriers and wood hewers or banished or exterminated
8774851 the difference between a jewish soul and souls of non jews all of them in all different levels is greater and deeper than the difference between a human soul and the soul of cattle
8774852 so much so that the world was created solely for the sake of jews
8774853 the majesty of israel and the question of the diaspora
8774854 there is no such thing as enemy civilians in war time
8774855 the law of our torah is to have mercy on our soldiers and to save them this is the real moral behind israels torah and we must not feel guilty due to foreign morals
8774856 a thousand non jewish lives are not worth a jews fingernail
8774857 is considered among the most learned sages of the torah
8774858 it is impossible to mix the pure with the impure they the arabs are a blight a devil a disaster the arabs are donkeys and we have to ask ourselves why god didnt create them to walk on all four well the answer is that they are needed to build and clean they dont have any place in our school
8774859 if they dont stop after we kill 100 then we must kill a thousand and if they dont stop after 1 000 then we must kill 10 000 if they still dont stop we must kill 100 000 even a million whatever it takes to make them stop

8774873 in order to understand the orthodox faith one has no need of reading secular histories of the faith no need of scholastic speculation about matters theological and no need to compile in some artificial fashion a set of doctrines about everything under the sun as it is revealed by scripture or by the fathers or by some

8774895 this poll shows clearly that voters support by a wide margin taking away the power of politicians to draw their own districts and putting that power into the hands of a citizens commission
8774896 no wonder the latest ppic poll shows voters want nothing to do with prop 11
8774897 theyre not interested in approving a redistricting process thats confusing complicated and reeks of politics

8774900 sensible people those who are aware of the decentralized and cussedly independent culture of university campuses would never have contemplated this project if our campus were a corporation it would have been easy you build a one size fits all application and mandate its use here at berkeley the only way something like this would fly was to create a centralized network system that was totally decentralized and would let every department and unit within the network have everything its own way impossible at the least insanely challenging
8774901 so this special this chicken alfredo tell me about it
8774902 ok well its fettucine alfredo with chicken not much else to really say i guess
8774903 cal alums tell me how proud they were to show off this original art in their simple digs
8774904 i predict that a new generation at cal will boast about this on facebook and myspace once the prints leave the morrison library they will become part of the stories our students tell about themselves
8774905 but we wanted to impress our girlfriends and guests with our impeccable taste so we stood in line at the morrison library room and came home with a fantastic tangled line ink drawing or possibly a print by stanley william hayter that now would sell in the thousands
8774906 it instantly upgraded our humble flat and probably the whole neighborhood we were so cool although im not sure we used that word in 1958
8774907 and it all began at the morrison room in 1958
8774908 year after year it became more popular and we got more prints
8774909 its distressing for the students to see the animals this way when they put in so much work
8774910 it has affected the agriculture department in many ways as the animals are vital to our education
8774911 but then i weighed out the options if something wasnt wrong then no real harm was done if something was wrong i really had no option so obviously i had to tell her
8774912 id seen a news article here in the u k a few years ago something similar and it just sparked a memory of that also the word cancer sprang to mind with the same memory so obviously i was quite concerned and just decided to do more research
8774913 grateful cannot even begin to describe how we feel toward maddie
8774914 do i consider madeleine our hero most certainly if she hadnt sent that e mail rowans prognosis wouldnt be as good as it is
8774915 it usually happens in infancy or early childhood and doctors precisely look in a babys eye with that light looking for a certain kind of reflection when that reflection is abnormal it raises the risk of whether this type of tumor is there
8774916 that white reflection you see in the babys eye is sometimes picked up just on routine photography in this case a web picture but what you hope is that doctors will see it internally before it gets to this stage
8774917 sometimes its there but its so faint it really appears later its hard to put blame somehow it was missed with our increasing number of premature babies there are other problems that could also sort of look like it
8774918 theyre worried about health care retirement and how theyll sustain their lifestyle
8774919 ive always wanted to live above my means because it inspired me to work harder

8774925 you worry about the joneses i worry about keeping up with the trumps
8774926 yes the church was led for several years by a prophet and apostles who didnt know who god was and thought somebody else was god we trace our authority to that same prophet and those apostles but its no big deal really just trust us mistakes happen sometimes you know who god is and sometimes you get confused and worship an assistant manager at burger king by mistake crap happens get over it and be sure to pay your tithing by the end of the month
8774927 there are those who believe or say they believe that adam is our father and our god that he is the father of our spirits and our bodies and that he is the one we worship the devil keeps this heresy alive as a means of obtaining converts to cultism it is contrary to the whole plan of salvation set forth in the scriptures anyone who has read the book of moses and anyone who has received the temple endowment and yet believes the adam god theory does not deserve to be saved

8774949 google is doing what it needed to do to respond to the outages but in fairness to google its held to a higher standard in terms of uptime and availability as are many on demand vendors when you compare them to internally deployed applications
8774950 a 24 hour outage of e mail for many companies would be catastrophic that indicates that our cautious approach is warranted

8775192 consideration has been given to all craven county voters and what best suits them
8775193 we looked at all locations so one site is not getting used to the point that it is overcrowded those selected are well spaced out
8775194 i saw them a lot more than i saw anybody else
8775195 we have found that we are much more likely to retain nurses who are already familiar with the region and have chosen to live here it helps a patient to know that the person taking care of them is one of their neighbors
8775196 craven has been welcoming and my family is here in the area so i never had to look anywhere else they are totally nurturing you have an identity here
8775197 we have some nurses here who are young enough to still have their cards checked at the bar and we have at least one nurse who is in her 70s and still working
8775198 we went to the administration and said hey we need to do something
8775199 we heard from people who wanted to be nurses but said they didnt have the money to go to school so we wanted to take that off the table
8775200 some of the first people who benefited from the scholarships were people who already worked here anyway but now they work here as nurses
8775201 the internet has definitely opened a big door for us
8775202 we want a nurse to fit with our mission or we dont want that nurse

8775217 as you know im a believer and ive never pretended not to be and i respect those who have no religious belief its a free country
8775218 for me its ultimately the order of the cosmos or what i describe as the creation
8775219 you cant simply have in my own judgment creation simply being a random event because it is so inherently ordered and the fact that the natural environment is being ordered where it can properly coexist over time
8775220 if you were simply reducing that to mathematically probabilities ive got to say it probably wouldnt have happened
8775221 so i think there is an intelligent mind at work
8775222 demonstrates just how important it is to continue with president bushs efforts to open markets for americas goods and services
8775223 no ones doing a victory dance but what we are doing is making sure that we continue to press congress on one of the most important aspects which is free trade
8775224 if there is someone who wore fate on his sleeve it is barack obama
8775225 you could see it happen you could feel it it was a matter of time
8775226 a leader that god has blesses us with at this time
8775227 barry was given a lesson that he would consume over and over his unique racial ancestry made him someone who certainly was not to be ostracized or shunned

8775233 is still ubiquitously taught even though many newer novels of adolescence are available
8775234 on the draconian nature of it the afl knows its family its community its culture they can make those judgments
8775235 but the key thing is to draw some clear lines in the sand about drugs in sport i commend the afl on the progress that its made
8775236 theyve been making progress on this and we would support them in sending a clear message that drugs in sport are unacceptable
8775237 its an abject weakness and its very difficult for us as presidents who genuinely care about the welfare of our players if in fact the club is not told
8775238 this is particularly evident in the riverland which recorded the lowest level of confidence where there is genuine concern about water restrictions and the future viability of local industries which are the life blood of the regions communities
8775239 they also predict that huge growth opportunities lie ahead for regional businesses in energy water and construction industries tourism aged care and information technology services

8775241 while there is no disguising the seriousness of the situation for the centro group we are making incremental steps towards stabilisation in a difficult environment
8775242 our fundamental task remains to secure long term debt restructuring and we will continue to work with our lending groups to achieve this goal
8775243 maintaining the underlying value of the business has been a major focus of the management team
8775244 the headline loss of 2 055 million does not reflect the operating performance of the group for the past financial year
8775245 after adding back the above items to the headline result the underlying earnings are 242 million
8775246 everything is political it is subtle and of course much less brutal than the version employed in stalins russia the process begins with children at school and operates on different levels
8775247 it is the time of year when parents and grandparents look forward to seeing their children dressed up as mary and joseph or the three wise men
8775248 react negatively to a culinary tradition other than their own by saying yuk
8775249 no racist incident should be ignored when there is a clear racist incident it is necessary to be specific in condemning the action
8775250 reveal negative attitudes the lack of censure may indicate to the child that there is nothing unacceptable about such attitudes
8775251 some people think that if a large number of racist incidents are reported this will reflect badly on the institution in fact the opposite is the case
8775252 i never really understood what was going on until i was interviewed the next day
8775253 that matter the thai and vietnamese sons you are photod with weekly too

8775266 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the past eight
8775267 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8775268 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8775269 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8775270 i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8775271 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations

8775282 clinton looked up over his spectacles and said i want all of you to understand something im not going to run as an isolationist and im not going to run as a protectionist
8775283 every time the united states has become protectionist weve paid a very heavy price free trade has been the engine of our economy
8775284 he then pulled his jacket back to display a handgun that appeared to be in the waistband of his pants
8775285 this is an individual who is looking for the heavy hitters as far as pain medications
8775286 he may be addicted to this type of thing or knows that there is a great demand for those drugs on the street
8775287 this new business model means allco will be a fiduciary manager of investment funds in aviation shipping and private equity
8775288 we will cease our principal investment activities sell remaining non core assets and in the future only use the balance sheet to co invest in our managed funds
8775289 this new structure is a major departure from our previous operations in which the group was heavily reliant on debt and as a result was exposed to the global credit crisis and deteriorating financial markets
8775290 with its previous complex structure allco had entered some non core businesses that were dependent on the ongoing availability of corporate funding
8775291 this new structure is a major departure from our previous operations in which the group was heavily reliant on debt and as a result was exposed to the global credit crisis and deteriorating financial markets
8775292 with its previous complex structure allco had entered some non core businesses that were dependent on the ongoing availability of corporate funding
8775293 they were either unprofitable in the new economic environment or required significant capital to achieve profitable scale
8775294 we have determined that capital is better deployed in our three core asset classes which fit our funds management model
8775295 unfortunately this has required the departure of many talented employees to date and will see a further reduction in headcount by up to 50 per cent by the end of june 2009 as we accelerate our restructuring program
8775296 the reconstruction of the group is progressing however the business remains in a fragile position and the continued market weakness is making the task difficult
8775297 we are committed to creating a leaner and simpler to understand company with realistic growth opportunities
8775298 we plan to continue to diversify and broaden our fleet with greater exposure to the growth segments particularly in high margin niche areas like lpg and offshore supply
8775299 i understand there are a few other people using facebook pages under my name which i find more flattering than creepy but this is me i dont know how i can prove that but feel free to test me
8775300 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8775301 trying to balance it up at user interface level and input timing by using joystick or something like that

8775307 shes very much her own person and she sticks to her guns
8775308 so i loaded some tracks onto my ipod and we all went out
8775309 he was totally quiet and i was like oh he thinks its awful
8775310 is all me its my stories and my choice of producers and writers
8775311 i forget that i had a first record until people bring it up
8775312 i was 15 when i started working on it i wanted to do a reggae album and that came through in three or four songs but i also had a linda perry rock song an aaliyah esque timbaland song and a britney sounding neptunes song
8775313 at 15 saying i wanted to do a reggae album after growing up in a snazzy house in houston it was kind of random
8775314 i think i decided is an important record a grammy record and as a live performer shes spectacular you cant hate on it
8775315 they have to understand that i wouldnt do the same kind of stuff the pussycat dolls would
8775316 as you know im a believer and ive never pretended not to be and i respect those who have no religious belief its a free country
8775317 for me its ultimately the order of the cosmos or what i describe as the creation

8775332 im not saying i have to be told as president but i would certainly like my chief executive to be told so if we have to help this player if we can protect other players from being influenced by the one whos tested positive thats surely got to be a step in the right direction

8775345 coming to the city means they can stay at the cipriani on the guidecca one of the worlds classiest hotels but it also meant they had to face questions from the european press
8775346 that inevitably meant there was more interest in personal matters such as how the pitt twins are theyre fine and when clooney is going to have children
8775347 i think it is long past time that we all shut up stop making public statements about private disputes and get on with the job we are paid to do
8775348 it is their rights that need to be at the forefront of all our minds we need to ensure that internal disputes and personal issues do not detract us from this overwhelmingly important mission
8775349 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8775350 it is to do with the continuation of that treatment into the very important job i was doing as the co ordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 olympics finally it is to do with the victimisation i have suffered since my grievances leaked to the media
8775351 i do not have grievances against the whole of the met an organisation that i dearly love and admire

8775360 its a matter of whether the country is still capable of having a bigger vision and demanding a vision of our politicians or whether were just a mob of petty pygmies
8775361 theres reason to believe the democrats have been catching up
8775362 i dont know if theyll achieve parity this year but theyll surely be better than they were in 2004

8775375 any time somebody says that they committed a murder we are going to take that seriously
8775376 we have no way of knowing whether or not richard cooey is just blowing smoke and making things up or whether he did in fact did kill somebody else more than 20 years ago
8775377 i forgot what i wasnt supposed to remember is an expanded view of the alien abduction phenomenon and contains details that are certain to be firsts regarding the reporting of this phenomenon to the public this book involves experiences with different types of greys hybrids blondes short pudgy beings tan wrinkled beings interdimensional beings super conscious beings as well as milabs encounters involving military and or government personnel sometimes working alongside alien beings
8775378 her story is in fact far more typical of abduction cases than we have been led to believe wilsons candid tale may have already opened the floodgates
8775379 if the aliens can learn from any of us what they can learn from katharina is of the highest importance anyone lucky enough to know her or to read her book will know exactly what i mean
8775380 an amazing journal which gives the reader a rich assortment of puzzle pieces to study
8775381 if the aliens can learn from any of us what they can learn from katharina is of the highest importance
8775382 this assemblage of material is designed to complete the authors own offering of herself for study and we might use the word dissection and still be within the limits of appropriateness she analyzes herself carefully transcribing her varying reactions and sensations as drawn from no fewer than 119 abductions this chart like data is supplemented by considerably more transcription of hypnotic regression than appears in the alien jigsaw itself both books taken together add up to a whole which is more than the sum of its parts we recommend buying both

8775384 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief
8775385 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that
8775386 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two
8775387 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is
8775388 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for
8775389 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure
8775390 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8775391 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st
8775392 now let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has
8775393 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8775394 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes
8775395 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the
8775396 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of
8775397 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8775398 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right
8775399 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it
8775400 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that
8775401 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the
8775402 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8775403 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our
8775404 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty
8775405 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling
8775406 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8775407 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont
8775408 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but
8775409 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against

8775411 this signifies what people have known all along about where to get news
8775412 ixias leasing program will enable our customers to finance up to 100 percent of equipment costs plus soft costs in the lease including training and professional services
8775413 this will benefit all kinds of companies start ups and enterprises with limited budgets as well as larger customers who find themselves at the end of a budget cycle and need to quickly fill a gap in their testing
8775414 were extremely pleased to partner with ixia and we look forward to expanding our capabilities into this new market space
8775415 chelsio communications is known for its robust high performance unified wire technology and we cant let budget constraints during a tight economy stop development and verification of our products
8775416 with ixfinancing we were able to protect our capex budget and at the same time add needed capacity to our testing labs
8775417 there have been a certain number of incidents recently that indicate a greater degree of activity on the part of russia
8775418 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
8775419 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second
8775420 it was like in the movies when they land and you see all the fire trucks and emergency crews thats a real experience
8775421 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
8775422 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened
8775423 any time somebody says that they committed a murder we are going to take that seriously
8775424 we have no way of knowing whether or not richard cooey is just blowing smoke and making things up or whether he did in fact did kill somebody else more than 20 years ago
8775425 after that fiesta bowl everybody knows who the university of utah is
8775426 certainly the university of utah is much more of a household name now
8775427 of course michigan is a well known big team across the nation
8775428 we respect them as an opponent but im not going to be intimidated by them just because theyre the university of michigan
8775429 i thought it was going to be a big towering structure but when we got there it was kind of underwhelming when it fills in its magnificent and they have an incredible program and tradition but in the end were all football players fighting for the same thing
8775430 if we all do that things cannot help but get better
8775431 the technology is market ready but then said it wont be available until 2009 that likely means the company is waiting for the start of production at its new state of the art pdp plant in amagasaki japan before commercializing the panels

8775441 this was my second time visiting the sf playhouse and i cant wait to go back for more
8775442 i have been in the hood for a while now
8775443 we at facebook took the awkwardness out of socializing allowing you to have thousands of friends without ever having to meet anyone who might be judgmental of your habits personal hygiene your long silences or your collection of porn and hunting knives
8775444 the technology is incredibly complex but in a nutshell users export their personal profile out of their workstations a process we call going outside after which they meet other users and do talking
8775445 they do this by making units of data called words that are then transmitted directly into the brains of other users
8775446 users should not attempt to transmit anything other than words into the brains of other users
8775447 we therefore urge our users not to try to poke their friends in their emoticons as we have had reports of eyeballs being popped out and smiley face emoticons turning into sad face emoticons
8775448 tough megawoman who have own lash and who like to whip naughty naughty businessman
8775449 we did a google corporate event with parties that cook and they went above and beyond our expectations

8775453 in my opinion this is the perfect spot for brunch lunch

8775461 hmm well once ive bought i wont need the sample just a small one please

8775471 nos encontramos em um daqueles momentos definidores um momento em que nossa na o est em guerra nossa economia est em crise e a promessa americana foi amea ada mais uma vez
8775472 eu cortarei impostos para 95 de todas as fam lias trabalhadoras porque em uma economia assim a ltima coisa que precisamos aumentar impostos da classe m dia
8775473 esse momento essa elei o nossa chance de manter no s culo 21 a promessa americana viva

8775479 today countless women have a second chance at life because of joe biden
8775480 they caught him in atlanta on the day of the funeral
8775481 one of the things i ve noticed about her is that when she started speaking she fell apart every time
8775482 she was crying through the whole talk it was almost as if she was more talking to herself
8775483 but now she s channeled it and embraced it as a greater purpose she s realized that she s giving the speech to help others
8775484 with fourth and fifth graders learning about social studies and government this is a great learning tool for them
8775485 anytime you can relate things to kids it helps them learn the material better
8775486 it s thrilling and exciting very much like a fairy tale
8775487 i had no idea what the role was going to be
8775488 when they called and said i would be nominating sen biden from the floor i pretty much dropped the phone
8775489 i think i have something like 170 e mails people suggested we have a viewing party at the house
8775490 i m definitely hoping to talk to sen biden and congratulate him and thank him for this opportunity
8775491 this kind of shakes your opinion of that i dont know i dont know this kind of shook me up its disheartening
8775492 yeah i think you can be the hard guy and do the heavy lifting and the hard work but when you have little children if it doesnt affect you then there is something wrong
8775493 i dont know it is just something you never get used to especially when it happens at your front door so i guess it is just one of those things you have to live with in this day and time
8775494 i know the drury inn i heard from them yesterday and theyre already booked through wednesday or thursday i cant remember exactly which day theyre getting reservations theyre filling up quick
8775495 i dont want teenagers going in and out of there doing drugs or whatever
8775496 i thought oh my goodness they cut the grass but look at it
8775497 we have inspectors come through all the time and check the property and they will cite you if you have a flat tire but then they let the property stay like this
8775498 it is extraordinary for us to beat the broadcast networks
8775499 this signifies what people have known all along about where to get news
8775500 i have been many times and will only rate it for my experience this past tuesday june 10 2008
8775501 oh your policys so good youve got a lot covered etc etc etc
8775502 instantly unleash the explosive power hidden behind this well guarded secret to dominating key search engine rankings in under 7 days using this embarrassingly simple backdoor shortcut

8775504 the skin has an ionic buffer zone that holds in moisture while protecting against free radicals and other damaging forces when the balance between negative and positive is out of whack due to exposure to pollution sun damage or stress the buffer cant do its job properly leaving skin both dry and more vulnerable platinum re established a good electrolyte balance improving moisturization and helping protect the skin
8775505 although some precious metals are used in medicine as anti inflammatories they require large amounts to be effective platinum is a very stable precious metal that can act as an antioxidant but its use in a skin cream in nano amounts is unlikely to exert any visible effect on skin
8775506 liz loomis in the 44th is a targeted seat by both parties having a good democratic turnout is important for her and she came out ahead in the primary
8775507 i dont want to vote for a rock star i want somebody who is going to take care of the issues
8775508 lack of discussion could mean that people are fine with how things are now besides you
8775509 in this situation your going to need contributors to that book to participate in the discussions voice opinions on what should be changed in written form on wiki and come to some sort of consensus before anything changes regardless of any individuals interpretation
8775510 again requirement that a actual discussion takes place is only on your head you only must provide an idea for other to express objection and grant them a chance to do it
8775511 it is sometimes difficult to make any contribution anywhere without it being considered original research
8775512 that metal is actually a very good metal in the right place but not on the road
8775513 well im not surprised quite frankly i think thats complete vindication isnt it of my concerns i have been giving bags of stones to roger twentyman tararua district council chief executive for years
8775514 we have people coming here from all over the world and they get to see the best the tararua can manage with their stones and their potholes
8775515 when the new board took over we seriously looked at winding the organisation up
8775516 but we gave ourselves 10 weeks to come up with a rescue package
8775517 under fifa rules we had to have a national body and we realised if we started something up we would have to deal with the same creditors again
8775518 also contracts were being signed before commercial support had been guaranteed and when that financial backing didnt eventuate we were stuck with an expense we had to carry
8775519 well always be responsible for the league but it doesnt mean we need to run it
8775520 in the past weve told the regions what is happening but now the regions have been completely involved in how weve come about our rescue package
8775521 there is little doubt that those two as well as our creditors particularly our biggest two in air new zealand and farifax media have been brilliant in their support for us to get back on track
8775522 we will be living within our means and the budget that has been set
8775523 if a national team comes back from overseas with a loss then someone else will miss out we will also be working to user pays
8775524 i wont be back in front of the regions asking for money if i was it would be to face the music
8775525 the message were portraying is the hole in the bucket is closed
8775526 recognising this we think the one step consideration offered by the call in process is an efficient way for the matters to be heard both in time and cost for the community the councils and mighty river power this process still allows local consultation and input
8775527 this letter formally seeks the views as to whether the council has the capacity to process and decide the applications and whether it considers the exercise of any of the powers of intervention would be appropriate
8775528 firstly were going to speak to our rma experts to find out exactly what the ramifications would be
8775529 i would have concerns if this limited in any way the people of palmerston norths ability to have input into the process
8775530 all i can say is that other districts will be considered in due course quite clearly there is a significant amount of planning needed
8775531 im pretty confident that the majority of our customers are pretty satisfied with the service they do get
8775532 i think that thing could be used for a lot of things especially response time because you cant run down there as quick as that thing can run down there
8775533 i believe were the first private entity in memphis to get them they were originally designed for government agencies only and were designed by law enforcement specialists
8775534 la vicenda alitalia lo specchio fedele di come il governo berlusconi sia vittima della sua demagogia e della sua inadeguatezza
8775535 il piano presentato ci consegna una compagnia di bandiera che di fatto diventa di bandierina con un inaccettabile ridimensionamento della capacit di espansione internazionale
8775536 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
8775537 capiamo i possibili vantaggi per gli azionisti privati della nuova alitalia non conosciamo invece le perdite della bad company e dei suoi azionisti pubblici cio gli italiani il governo venga in parlamento a illustrare i piani industriali delle due societ assumendosi le responsabilit che gli competono
8775538 chiedo al governo un incontro immediato che coinvolga tutti gli altri enti locali del nostro territorio annuncia alemanno per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
8775539 futuro della compagnia di bandiera e dellintero sistema aeroportuale che hanno un peso fondamentale per il territorio di roma e del lazio
8775540 il piano del governo ha molti pi esuberi di quello proposto da air france e smantella la compagnia di bandiera
8775541 anche se siamo fuori dal parlamento ci opporremo e lo faremo in piazza e tra la gente cominciamo oggi
8775542 anche se non si hanno ancora delle statistiche esatte ci sono parecchie persone che soffrono di questa malattia
8775543 im a volunteer i just thoroughly enjoy it people call us angels we do a lot for them and they are very gracious for it
8775544 following katrina the red cross has staged a lot more materials we have worked a lot more with partnerships with churches and other agencies to be better prepared
8775545 weve already got bedding for them making sure our pantry is restocked beyond normal capacity
8775546 their job will be to go out and search areas and look for possible structures that are compromised and victims trapped and then as we get word heavy teams will get underway and begin to extricate victims
8775547 clearly no serious response to climate change can ignore the need to reduce emissions from australias coal fired electricity generation sector
8775548 they are obviously going to be quite embarrassed about it but it goes to show that nobody can take any chances out there
8775549 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral candidate mccain criticizes senator mccains own climate change bill candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it

8775554 i dont feel famous but it is kinda cool having them see me as a movie star
8775555 you came in lay down like a marae and watched a 15 minute loop with a soundtrack
8775556 they flooded it again to create a bigger power station thats what runs the lights in auckland
8775557 all the people who lived there had to leave they lost their homes they lost their land and they just had to move on
8775558 at the moment a huge number of people are being dislocated with the flooding of valleys in the name of progress
8775559 it was all about ambiguity you dont know if the man is digging a grave or garden and i had children with suitcases so that you couldnt really tell if they were going to school or leaving town for good
8775560 the valley and the village were lost underwater and so were historical sites significant to ngati koroki kahukura
8775561 on our watch we used government as an instrument to keep people safe under your watch people died
8775562 a chinese foreign ministry spokesman on thursday urged the news media to report with objectivity and fairness after being asked to comment on the suspension of a chinese journalist by a major german broadcaster spokesman qin gang was speaking in response to a journalists question concerning a zhang danhongs suspension from her post at international broadcaster deutsche welle due to her remarks showing friendliness toward china
8775563 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8775564 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8775565 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8775566 what is the name of senator obamas comprehensive early education plan
8775567 i think its time we taught them a lesson about how to win an election
8775568 the stakes in this election are too big we need all of you we have to out hustle out work out think them
8775569 final night of the conventions tonight dont miss baracks speech

8775578 he has just been admitted for abdominal discomfort investigation will commence tomorrow morning and there is no cause for concern
8775579 we cannot tell you for how many days he will stay in the hospital at the moment
8775580 he is resting and has not had any visitor since he reached the hospital
8775581 if nobody wants to talk with us on these issues and co operation with russia is not needed then for gods sake do it yourself
8775582 not because anyone is asking us and not because we want to look good in someones eyes
8775583 we are doing it because it corresponds to our national interests because in this field our interests coincide with those of many european countries and those of the united states
8775584 the russian president raised the possibility of continuing the dialogue and the discussion
8775585 by removing traditional formalities we allow for a more personal communication between teacher and student
8775586 teachers are the authority figure that children look up to for advice and guidance and addressing teachers by their title is fine with me because of this
8775587 reasonably unimportant as neither will make them more respected or liked its how good they are at working with our children that matters
8775588 de eu concentreert zich op haar kerntaken door zich te richten op de gemeenschappelijke markt en grensoverschrijdende problemen en kansen voor het overige treedt de eu niet in de bevoegdheden van de lidstaten
8775589 the risks associated with antipsychotic use in patients with dementia generally outweigh the potential benefits and in this patient group use of antipsychotic drugs should be avoided whenever possible
8775590 purists are not going to like this and not everyone is going to like it
8775591 we are going to do our best to do it quickly and accurately
8775592 that is how many weve had so far and it will vary from year to year
8775593 when we come back with a ruling from video replay there is no argument unless it involves spectator interference and then the manager is entitled to an explanation
8775594 were only talking about home runs balls were not talking about plays at third base or balls and strikes or any of those things were just talking about a select portion of the game
8775595 sometimes with the configurations of these ballparks and so forth it makes it tough
8775596 im a throwback old baseball guy and i like the way that baseball is played and i like the part where the umpires decision held up and at the same time it didnt mean that they dont miss them and they dont get them right thats part of it
8775597 i think instant replay will definitely help that but i think it will take a little bit longer in the game and every year we go to spring training and the season starts and they always talk to us about shortening the time of the game
8775598 if they have to do a replay youre standing out there for five minutes doing nothing
8775599 they want to speed the game up make the call
8775600 the way they are building them now with all the angles its tougher to see what is going on
8775601 it doesnt really matter either way for me i hope it doesnt distract anything i hope they get the calls right
8775602 its all about heart and i have a big heart
8775603 you want noel playing through the middle 25 times a game so were going to be smart and figure out what he does best and what gives him the best chance for success
8775604 im doing more to be above average and working harder than everybody else im looking forward to proving myself
8775605 its like a business and i had to learn that
8775606 you will be a better running back when you study the game being around the coaches and being in the meeting rooms they know their stuff and that made me want to know my stuff i have to know where the holes will be and who ill have to block
8775607 everywhere you go somebody wants a picture somebody wants an autograph somebody wants something from you
8775608 even when it comes from friends its hard to know who your friends are sometimes because everybody wants that association not everybody but a lot of people do thats something theyve got to deal with thats probably a little different than what they thought
8775609 we just talked about things other than football and got to know each other
8775610 anytime youre with herschel its really cool to be around him hes a good guy and a good person to be around i was pretty excited
8775611 im going to do the same things i did last year just try and get better each and every week and work on the small things to get us better as a team
8775612 year after year the continued success of the mens final four demonstrates it is one of americas great events
8775613 the support from our corporate champions and corporate partners for the mens final four and all 88 ncaa championships is strong and growing
8775614 nato has not traditionally played a role in energy security matters it can however play a more active role defending energy infrastructure and the flow of oil and gas on the high seas nato might also provide security for infrastructure in energy producing states facing unrest
8775615 tentatively i cant remember if this was a definite or not support for c 3 0 coming to all platforms
8775616 shawn melland last year we had a very experienced group and sometiimes if i wasnt leading them then somebody else was and this year we are a little bit younger but it is kind of fun with this group because those young guys are hungrey and it brings a sense of enjoyment to the defense and i am looking forward to it
8775617 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8775618 the housing industry is facing serious problems and we brought this talented panel together to help us better understand the issues and what the solutions might be
8775619 the goal for the nation must be to close the homeownership gap between whites and people of color
8775620 whites had more sub prime loans than all minorities combined
8775621 the housing industry is facing serious problems and we brought this talented panel together to help us better understand the issues and what the solutions might be
8775622 the goal for the nation must be to close the homeownership gap between whites and people of color
8775623 whites had more sub prime loans than all minorities combined
8775624 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8775625 would you mind me entertaining myself a little while you fish
8775626 but just keep it down in case the parks and wildlife folks are around they tend to hide out at a distance and watch folks on the lake with binoculars then run up on you if they think youre breaking the rules
8775627 naw you look good up there driving go ahead if you like were heading right over there around that bend so go ahead and open her up

8775658 well keep making phone calls all day long and see what happens
8775659 theres a buried treasure out there and weve got to go chase it
8775660 its a good way to keep all the attention tomorrow from being on obama
8775661 theyre getting into the other sides heads on an important day for them i think making this news tonight would be smart but almost as useful is making news with the suggestion youll be making news
8775662 announcing the pick on friday cuts off obamas momentum leaking it thursday night cuts into the coverage of his speech in a huge way on the biggest night of s life he could end up with a split headline in the morning paper
8775663 mccain should make a clean steal of the spotlight after obama is done
8775664 let obama finish his show then mccain should swiftly step in if he leaks early obama will regain much if not most of the spotlight with his speech plus there still should be enough civility in the business to allow an opponent their moment in the sun
8775665 given the trouble mccain faces its probably worth the risk and if it is a choice that causes them problems in their base they also mute the level of public criticism
8775666 keep regressing to the most orthodox explanation that the long rnas are junk but they cant just sit on their intellectual backsides and tell us to prove it
8775667 its not about money its not about money at all
8775668 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8775669 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8775670 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent
8775671 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8775672 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8775673 nosotros como representantes del gobierno nacional bolivariano liderado por el presidente hugo ch vez permanecemos ac esperando a estos atletas al igual que hicimos con la hist rica delegaci n de 110 deportistas que dejaron la piel en los reci n finalizados juegos ol mpicos
8775674 el trabajo no ha culminado a n es cierto que ya 110 de nuestros muchachos nos demostraron de qu est hecho el esp ritu y el temple del venezolano pero ahora le llega el turno a 27 guerreros y guerreras m s que desde el pr ximo 6 de septiembre dejar n todo en la pista la piscina el gimnasio el vel dromo y las calles de beijing para que el mundo siga reconociendo a los atletas de raza bolivariana a los hijos de esta revoluci n deportiva
8775675 toda la dotaci n deportiva fue embarcada en caracas entre mi rcoles y jueves ya para el d a 30 debemos tenerla ac completa para recibir a esos muchachos y muchachas como se merecen
8775676 tomando en consideraci n las necesidades especiales de cada atleta
8775677 existen artesanos que ofrecen diversos productos dentro de un mismo sector por ejemplo en el artesanal algunos se dedican a hacer mu ecas de trapo otros bebidas orfebrer a o bisuter a y aunque son creaciones distintas pueden tener todos la marca
8775678 esto es bastante productivo algo que no conoc amos pens bamos que s lo los grandes comerciantes pod an tener una marca pero ya sabemos que no que las amas de casa los estudiantes personas de la tercera edad podemos contar con una que nos identifique como venezolanos lo que nos han explicado hoy estos conocimientos son una luz m s para seguir adelante con nuestros proyectos para darnos a conocer y para que nos tomen en cuenta en todo el pa s
8775679 esta es una experiencia completamente nueva para nosotros hasta ahora s lo entregamos nuestros productos con un recibo pero es cierto no tenemos nada que nos identifique con las marcas s podremos darnos a conocer en otros lados incluso fuera del pa s

8775685 well roshus many years ago way back when great grandpa bunny was about your age there were some people who worked very hard to help build our country they liked what they did but some people felt there should be a special way to thank them just as i thank you when you put your plate in the sink or help me in the garden they wanted to find a way to say thank you for a job well done many people thought about how they could show appreciation for all of the workers and someone we think it was either peter mcguire or matthew maguire decided it would be nice to give them a day off and to have a parade and a picnic in their honor
8775686 well son some people wanted to have it in may because that is when many other places honored their workers they decided though to make it special by having it at the end of the summer it would be a good time to relax and have fun before the children went back to school and would provide a time for celebration during the long period between the fourth of july and thanksgiving so they held the first labor day parade in new york city on tuesday september 5 1882 over 10 000 people came to the parade and then went to reservoir park to have their picnics and play games
8775687 more time to swim play and barbeque stuff before school starts
8775688 there are other traditions besides parades and picnics back when i was a young bunny we couldnt wear white clothes after labor day especially white shoes
8775689 what difference does it make what color you wear why cant you wear it whenever you want even mother nature wears white after labor day snow white is one of my favorite colors
8775690 football the national football league starts its season on labor day weekend then we know summer is really over and it wont be long before we need to bundle up to sit in the bleachers and cheer for our favorite team
8775691 football is good but my favorite starts then too nascar racing thats the best its exciting knowing that once we get through labor day its off to the races
8775692 the parade is great the picnic is fun football and nascar racing are exciting but the best thing of all on labor day is the mda telethon i sit up all night watching those stars helping other people it makes me feel good
8775693 it makes me feel good to know we live in a country where we can decide for ourselves what to do on labor day
8775694 please god bless those who dont get to take today off as they work to keep us safe bless those who still have to labor on labor day and god please be sure their moms save them some carrot chip cookies
8775695 the secret to sobering up is time no amount of coffee energy drinks cold showers or even a full irish will speed up the process you might feel better but it doesnt mean you are fit to drive
8775696 the positive thing about having any storm hit you it will reveal any kind of frailty in the system

8775752 a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8775753 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8775754 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8775755 if my guesses are confirmed then the suspicion is raised that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8775756 i think that those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8775757 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8775758 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8775759 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader

8775763 there should be guidelines set up on testing the products
8775764 our thoughts are with the family at this tragic time as the incident remains under investigation it would not be appropriate for us to offer and further comment

8775767 what we do is we harvest the hair from the back of the head and we take out a one inch strip and then we replace it into the front hair line so that when she looks in the mirror its totally undetectable and it is her own hair

8775835 twenty to 30 japanese members of these groups go in and out of afghanistan

8776097 to come clean and confirm whether this delay is because childrens personal information is at risk
8776098 extracting oil from algae to produce a more sustainable biofuel is one of the most promising and exciting areas of biofuels research today
8776099 algae have significant potential as a clean renewable and economical fuel source and they do not compete with the food supply
8776100 for enterprise our companys success depends on the availability of vehicles and fuel and both must be acceptable to society that is why we are taking steps now to invest in the future
8776101 i may have actually learned more than my colleague did based on his own revelations
8776102 the ultimate benefits of solid state will require software management and systems capabilities
8776103 ibm is integrating this technology with systems and applications so that companies can achieve real business value from solid state disk quicksilver is a significant step forward in this comprehensive systems strategy
8776104 this is not about replacing todays hard disk drive with a new form factor this is about having a complete end to end systems approach
8776105 very often the collection and use of personal information is essential and beneficial to modern life but it is important for individuals privacy to be a consideration in the planning stages of any new project
8776106 adjustments to the uk regulatory framework are required given consumers rapid adoption of mobile broadband services
8776107 85 percent of uk adults have a mobile phone and the uk mobile industry has five operators who between them generate over 15bn a year 51 per cent of overall retail revenue for telecoms in the uk and now produces more revenue than fixed voice and broadband services combined
8776108 i wouldnt like that now i was a different person
8776109 i just want a girl who knows her body is the temple of god and takes care of herself
8776110 but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint
8776111 is if you just use you bob and you bob as caricatures the truth is both of you acknowledge the world is more complicated
8776112 the economy has changed in the last 15 years and our understanding of economic policy has changed as well
8776113 and that means that what was appropriate in 1993 is no longer appropriate
8776114 i still would have probably made a slightly different choice than clinton did
8776115 i probably wouldnt have been as obsessed with deficit reduction
8776116 she had to think very practically about how do you make money
8776117 how does the system work that led me to have an orientation to ask hardheaded questions during my formative years there was still ideological competition between a social democratic or even socialist agenda and a free market milton friedman agenda i think it was natural for me to ask questions of both sides and maybe try to synthesize approaches
8776118 reagans central insight that the liberal welfare state had grown complacent and overly bureaucratic with democratic policy makers more obsessed with slicing the economic pie than with growing that pie contained a good deal of truth
8776119 i like to think of him as a university of chicago democrat
8776120 ive never worked with a campaign that was more interested in what the research shows
8776121 this could be one of the biggest pieces of corporate welfare ever
8776122 the market is the best mechanism ever invented for efficiently allocating resources to maximize production
8776123 and i also think that there is a connection between the freedom of the marketplace and freedom more generally
8776124 weve probably done a better job of the last 20 years on the problems the market can solve than the problems the market cant solve were doing pretty well on the size of peoples houses and televisions and the like were not looking so good on infrastructure and education
8776125 the free market centrism of the clinton years to a revived push for european style social democracy
8776126 this is in many respects a deeply un american solution to the problems facing our country
8776127 one that would emphasize dependence over self sufficiency and bureaucratic condescension over self help
8776128 if you talk to warren hell tell you his preference is not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
8776129 that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end
8776130 i do think that what the argument may miss is the sense of control that we want individuals to have in determining their own career paths making their own life choices and so forth and i also think you want to instill that sense of self reliance and that what you do will help determine outcomes
8776131 we all talk about apollo 11 but there were some pretty public pretty awful failures along the way
8776132 the united states didnt say well we had some failures
8776133 now thats the story now telling it elegantly low taxes smaller government the way the republicans have i think is more of a challenge
8776134 one just because i think it really captures where i was going with the whole issue of balancing market sensibilities with moral sentiment one of my favorite quotes is you know that famous robert f kennedy quote about the measure of our g d p
8776135 well ill send it to you because its one of the most beautiful of his speeches
8776136 counts special locks for our doors and the jails for those who break them

8776158 the problem is due to interference from outside the region and it is also due to the actions of georgian leaders we believe that if other countries did not interfere then the peoples of this region would live peacefully
8776159 we think georgias leaders should be more in control of the situation and they should stop countries from outside the region from interfering
8776160 all countries from outside the region not to interfere and countries in the region to resolve these issues
8776161 some western powers by encouraging certain political forces and countries and calling on them to join military agreements are harming integration in the region and are creating tension in relations between neighboring countries
8776162 this is how they pave the way for political and military influence and unfortunately their unilateral actions are continuing
8776163 i paid 15 12 10 a piece and will sell for 12 10 8
8776164 good grief how big is this kid how much bigger could she he get where will i put her
8776165 to date no lawsuits have been filed against united artists or mr cruise nor have any allegations been made of any involvement of mr cruise in this incident
8776166 all press reports and comments to the press stating otherwise and designed to generate sensational headlines are false
8776167 please tell us what injuries your client suffered with necessary evidence from a doctor we would then make proposals for compensation
8776168 mr cruise ms wagner and united artists entertainment did not exercise reasonable care to select a reasonably competent experienced careful and properly equipped contractor
8776169 he was captured at the airport he had just returned from lebanon with his family
8776170 we strongly condemn this operation against one of the highest officials of the committee who had done good work
8776171 coalition forces captured a man suspected of working within the highest echelons of the special groups criminals
8776172 i will be shortly introducing a censure resolution of the president and the administration on this administrations outrageous attack on the rule of law all the way from the illegal terrorist surveillance program to their attitude about torture t his administration has done the greatest assault on our constitution perhaps in american history
8776173 i think weve never been as close to george orwells 1984 as before we live in a society where individual rights and legality are definitely threatened and thats scary
8776174 blind faith in bad leaders is not patriotism a patriot does not tell people to refrain from speaking out in the name of politeness or for the sake of being a good host or to show slavish blind obedience and deference to a dishonest war mongering human rights violating president
8776175 o ver the past 6 years weve had to add to the american picture rendition illegal wiretapping voter suppression no habeas corpus to the neglect of our great city of new orleans and her people an attack on the constitution and the loss of our best young men and women in a tragic war
8776176 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8776177 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8776178 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8776179 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8776180 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8776181 resistance movement is the only possible way to counter such regime

8776187 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8776188 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8776189 mr mckinnon has recently been diagnosed as suffering from aspergers syndrome as a result we will be writing to the home secretary again inviting a prosecution in this country
8776190 our client now faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot
8776191 our clients case highlights a worrying trend where uk citizens are at the mercy of the ever increasing tendency of overseas prosecutors to extend their jurisdiction to crimes allegedly committed in this country
8776192 intentional and calculated to influence and affect the us government by intimidation and coercion
8776193 i suppose it means im not a secretive sophisticated checking myself every step of the way type of hacker
8776194 ive lost two jobs because of this my bosses just didnt want to be associated with the publicity
8776195 american officials involved in this case have stated that they want to see him fry the consequences he faces if extradited are both disproportionate and intolerable and we will be making an immediate application to the european court to prevent his removal
8776196 the difference between the american system and our own is not perhaps so stark as the appellants argument suggests
8776197 the us is making a clear stand that anyone making any attempts to compromise its computers and data will face the consequences
8776198 we honor that service but that doesnt mean we have to make him president
8776199 tenemos una ley de reparaciones una comisi n de reparaciones pero no tenemos el dinero que se necesita para implementar esto y creo que estamos algo atrasados en lo que son las reparaciones simb licas que son muy importantes porque les da sentido y valor a las victimas
8776200 the thing about this movie is you will see daniel doing stuff that you just wont believe
8776201 there are sequences in this film which are just spectacular and people will see him in these unbelievable situations
8776202 and the audience is very sophisticated these days they can tell when you have cgi or use doubles or whatever so the audience will see daniel in these unbelievable situations
8776203 theres a big fire sequence and youve never seen anything like it and daniels in the middle of all of that along with olga too and our leading villain mathieu its unbelievable what they all did and the training they went through the stunt and special effects guys were great support
8776204 we would be sitting there and daniel would be in the thick of it and he would disappear a fireball would go off and you are looking at several different cameras going oh my god where he is where is he oh there he is and you know it was all day long for weeks on end
8776205 i think for us marc was a fairly obvious choice because he can tell a narrative understands character and works well with actors
8776206 and he has this great vision so those are all the elements we admire in his films and want to have in our films
8776207 the question about whether he could do action well we didnt know that because it hasnt been in his previous films but he has certainly turned out to be a great action director
8776208 and daniel continues to go from strength to strength he has done amazing work on completely dedicated to it and throws himself into the role with such passion we couldnt be happier
8776209 its an entirely new story the title is from a fleming short story quantum of solace and has various meanings and interpretations as to how it fits in with the film
8776210 quantum of solace as described by fleming is a measure of comfort when a relationship breaks down you know that its irretrievably broken if theres not a quantum of solace not a measure of comfort between the two people and thats what the short story is about
8776211 at the end of casino royale i think thats the way bond feels about vesper lynd and that relationship on the other hand he is desperately looking for a bit of comfort himself
8776212 he started off as one thing a soldier with a certain point of view and through the course of the film his emotional life took over and he was betrayed
8776213 and this takes him into direct conflict with judi dench as m he has to come to terms with what has happened in the past and he has to kind of redefine who he is and decide how he is going to pursue evil in the future and what parts he has to shut off and what parts of him he can lay to rest so its very rich material
8776214 its exciting and the thing is bond opens so many doors
8776215 because fortunately after 46 years you are a known quantity so in many places that would never in a million years allow a production in they let us shoot there
8776216 fortunately we have a good track record and we like to leave a place as we found it and we have been able to shoot in some of the most extraordinary places in the world sugarloaf mountains the eiffel tower the temples of karnac in egypt and we are very respectful of these wonderful places and it is exciting because you get to go to these places youd never ordinarily see
8776217 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

8776248 other than yourself who else would be involved in making a decision like this
8776249 what type of investment were you thinking you would make to fix this problem
8776250 will only improve with time its day one traffic is massive were new there are bugs to fix results to improve
8776251 one way leads to diamonds one way leads to gold another leads you only to everything your told in your heart you wonder which of these is true the road that leads to nowhere the road that leads to you
8776252 i have never questioned whether this is true or not
8776253 its a great marketing tool if you can combine waterborne with recycling in your shop it attracts people who are green conscious
8776254 improvements in technology equipment and price are all coming together at the same time and the epa is noticing
8776255 i was happy the nfl was willing to take a second long and hard look at the situation
8776256 the real secrets that most people will never know about making money online
8776257 ive played the same way ive played throughout the year
8776258 i just havent been scoring the way i would like even though i feel like im playing better the little shots around the greens have cost me but im starting to get that turned around and i expect to have a much better week
8776259 it was a fun tournament last year and i loved the opportunity to have won the tournament
8776260 but i also love the way it happened with the opportunity to play three rounds with tiger
8776261 id be making half as much as i am now
8776262 im very thankful hes in our sport and hes had the success and the charisma and the lure to attract corporate america as well as fans to the game
8776263 you know that right you are playing left handed this week arent you
8776264 the key is going to be again scoring getting up and down around the greens that i miss and getting those birdie putts to drop
8776265 the last time we play the red sox in this yankee stadium and the battles weve been through this should end like this
8776266 no one likes to deal with the losing and were losing right now and we feel were better than this but at some point you are what your record is until you prove otherwise
8776267 we havent performed the bottom line is were not getting what we need to from everybody that we expected

8776352 the whole project was just stopped end of discussion he said
8776353 it appears that it was michael powell not the public who preferred to make decisions based on personal ideology
8776354 but you can go too far and i dont plan to do that
8776355 if this draft legislation were passed in its present form the director of the central intelligence agency has told me that he did not believe that the interrogation program could go forward
8776356 together with elvis and johnny cash wills is in both the country music and rock n roll halls of fame
8776357 there was a connection between the events of september 11 2001 and iraq
8776358 let me just first tell you that ive never been more convinced that the decisions i made are the right decisions
8776359 if it was anyone else wed be stringing them up by their neck but no its bobby dee and the folk process
8776360 who cares what you think punk you dont even have a name
8776361 this is an issue of having community leaders come to an agreement
8776362 was inspired by partisan divisions inside the broadcasting board of governors
8776363 to resist economic pressures to make additional cuts which could remove it from the top ranks of american journalism
8776364 but as a community voice in the metropolitan region the los angeles times is irreplaceable
8776365 so good to see you ive heard about your good news congratulations
8776366 that little nerd is going to be controlling hundreds of thousands of dollars in awards
8776367 thats why one must always be hospitable to everyone even little nerds
8776368 im just happy to have this chance to do something for jewish culture for the culture as a whole really
8776369 i guess ill have to stop making fun of your eating habits
8776370 can we guess and youll tell us if were right or wrong
8776371 if youre giving out two prizes theyre going to bellow and roth three then its bellow and roth and ozick
8776372 between them theyve put out something like a hundred books and in all those years of chatter all those forests laid to waste neither of them has been able to come up with one lifelike woman character
8776373 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
8776374 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive
8776375 maybe i can get you on charlies show you and one of the patriarchs

8776388 this time theres going to be a larger police presence than normal
8776389 really its just good fun in my experience it hasnt been violent like the last time was
8776390 for me its just community more than anything iits fantastic to be a part of big group rides
8776391 has it outlived its usefulness critical mass at its inception was about shining the light on a disparity between the allocation of resources what the protest is about now is the real question
8776392 republican presidential candidate john mccain decided on a running mate early today and one top prospect minnesota gov tim pawlenty abruptly canceled numerous public appearances
8776393 ive three houses in here rolling and its just moving that way further
8776394 it had a burning ember melt a hole in it
8776395 youre going to have to knock it down from the inside
8776396 i was against the war before it was cool to be against the war
8776397 uh uh uh hold on im trying to think uh uh uh
8776398 this is the most important speech of barack obamas career
8776399 we feel that developers should have an open and unobstructed environment to make their content available
8776400 while s amp p feels that tupperware has made significant improvement they still feel that it will be necessary to keep a close eye on the company tupperware has continued to steadily improve however the direct sales industry continues to be highly competitive and at times volatile the outlook for the company is good and will remain stable for the foreseeable future the ratings on tupperware continue to reflect the risks of direct sales distribution and the companys participation in the highly competitive cosmetics industry said but he said the companys moderate financial policies improving credit protection measures its product and geographic diversity along with its well known brand name and premium product position in the mature molded plastic storage category offset these factors
8776401 there is nothing worth sharing like the love that lets us share our name
8776402 purists are not going to like this and not everyone is going to like it
8776403 we are going to do our best to do it quickly and accurately
8776404 that is how many weve had so far and it will vary from year to year
8776405 when we come back with a ruling from video replay there is no argument unless it involves spectator interference and then the manager is entitled to an explanation
8776406 were only talking about home runs balls were not talking about plays at third base or balls and strikes or any of those things were just talking about a select portion of the game
8776407 sometimes with the configurations of these ballparks and so forth it makes it tough
8776408 im a throwback old baseball guy and i like the way that baseball is played and i like the part where the umpires decision held up and at the same time it didnt mean that they dont miss them and they dont get them right thats part of it
8776409 i think instant replay will definitely help that but i think it will take a little bit longer in the game and every year we go to spring training and the season starts and they always talk to us about shortening the time of the game
8776410 if they have to do a replay youre standing out there for five minutes doing nothing
8776411 they want to speed the game up make the call
8776412 its a very fair result and we appreciate the nfl taking a second look
8776413 brandon was thrilled its as good as we expected or hoped for
8776414 we are excited for sean to join our team hornets general manager jeff bower said on thursday
8776415 he is a veteran leader who has been on winning teams and will be a great addition to our frontcourt bower added
8776416 i ask forgiveness in the name of the paraguayan nation for so many injustices to which you were subjected forgiveness for every single trace of physical and emotional pain
8776417 as of this moment the justice system is facing an immense challenge
8776418 falls short of the reality of this painful human rights violation
8776419 the main instrument of social control used by the military regime
8776420 we want to specifically underscore the sexual violence that was used as a repressive strategy aimed at demonstrating the aggressors power and dominance over their victims
8776421 fail to reflect the pain of the paraguayan people in its full dimension
8776422 the report is also a contribution to the necessary transformations of the state to prevent future violations and generate awareness that will make it possible to dismantle the institutional political military police and cultural mechanisms and structures that made the abuses possible
8776423 one of the recommendations that i can give at the age of 70 is that everyone should work together to make sure that the dictatorship does not return people need to know what really happened and they must not forget
8776424 sometimes i hear people say that life was better during the dictatorship but i certainly wasnt living better since i didnt have freedom
8776425 he raced at a time when racing was extremely dangerous and got through it all without a serious injury lamm said
8776426 he had an extraordinary mechanical sense he was very much in tune with the car
8776427 i as well as all employees of ferrari are extremely saddened by the news of the passing of phil hill a man and a champion who gave so much to ferrari ferrari president luca di montezemolo said
8776428 phil and i have always kept in touch throughout the years and i know i will miss his passion and love for ferrari very much
8776429 and he knew it off the top of his head he was extremely intelligent and well rounded he was an opera expert and very well read he was very sophisticated
8776430 phil was a very special guy and had a love for the automotive age said dan gurney a teammate with ferrari
8776431 he was always a potential winner when he sat in a race car he was both a competitor and a close friend and a fellow i could look up to
8776432 the level of intensity has certainly risen the past few weeks and theres definitely more pressure
8776433 we have to be sure were on top of our game we cant make mistakes and we have to be sure were doing everything right
8776434 were racing the guys in 10th 11th 12th 13th and 14th if they take a big risk it may push us into a corner to take a risk
8776435 but thats not our focus our focus is number one to make our car go fast secondly we must run our race and not worry about the other competitors we shouldnt have to base our decisions on what other teams are doing
8776436 its a fun track and ive had a lot of success there we should be extremely fast out there
8776437 we won there earlier this year and we were in victory lane just a few weeks ago at michigan a pretty similar track weve been fortunate enough to win the last two races in a row and wed love to make it three this weekend
8776438 when we reached the house where they were holding the girl they opened fire on our agents
8776439 a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division
8776440 mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8776441 have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact
8776442 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8776443 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8776444 we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8776445 borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
8776446 represents a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division
8776447 barack obama had the experience and wisdom to oppose a popular war based on faulty premises
8776448 his leadership experience has given him a unique capacity to inspire hope in the promise of the american dream of a boundless future
8776449 the scary part is how much pakistan has learned from them
8776450 i simply dont believe the french need the chinese to do non explosive testing they have a very strong program and i cant see them exposing it to the prying eyes of the chinese
8776451 i think it is extremely unlikely that china tested a pakistani bomb
8776452 i believed they just wanted to show that they were competent they were very open to me
8776453 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8776454 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8776455 he had no blueprint to look at he had no textbook to consult
8776456 he dealt with it and if youve noticed there hasnt been a terror attack in the united states of america since sept 11
8776457 when republicans are in charge and were spending like drunken sailors its an embarrassment
8776458 i feel like hes had extreme ups and extreme downs but in texas were still proud of him
8776459 his job was to keep us safe and he has done that he will go down in history for that
8776460 its worth every penny its worth every drop of blood we had to shed
8776461 is deterring those terrorists from being able to come and attack us theyre too busy hiding
8776462 if those things actually happen then its going to look like a brilliant foreign policy
8776463 instead of patrolling the streets of baghdad maybe we should have been patrolling the streets of detroit
8776464 thats going to be the nail in his coffin just like johnson with vietnam
8776465 bush went in with the idea to work in a bipartisan manner with both parties and for some reason nobody will let that happen
8776466 id like to have seen more of that rather than the intransigence
8776467 he comes to a conclusion and he sticks with that conclusion
8776468 if a person who does that turns out to be right they are labeled as dogged or determined
8776469 if a person who does that is wrong they are labeled as stubborn foolish or bullheaded
8776470 there is always work to be done and i hope that we can expand upon these reforms in the future to ensure greater transparency in government practices
8776471 for the convictions of a member of congress five high level legislative branch officials one high level executive branch official and two other mid to low level public officials
8776472 the irony of all this is the laws and ethics rules that apply to the conventions are quite fine the problem is that no ones enforcing them
8776473 the parties have changed somewhat in structure but there are still these huge lobbyist studded soirees
8776474 how hard is it to round up 25 lobbyists to go to a party with the chairman of a committee which affects their interests
8776475 the skybox will be complete with food and beverages and republican governors senior staff and additional republican vips will be invited
8776476 we have the opportunity for them to come and talk policy but we also have the opportunity to come and have a very good time
8776477 to ensure our company positions on this and other policy priorities are well represented
8776478 the change in ethics rules is one of the factors we considered when deciding how to participate in the conventions
8776479 we are having a cocktail reception fully compliant with the ethics rules toothpicks and all
8776480 its really meant to highlight the issue of wasteful spending and taxes to make sure that subject is something that people will discuss during the course of the convention
8776481 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8776482 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8776483 i think based on the way you guys are playing the songs the actual tracking of the songs is gonna happen very quickly
8776484 its gonna be on and its gonna be on fire everyones gonna be looking at each other and i think its gonna be amazing its not gonna be a boring laborious its gonna be all worked out were gonna know what it is you can practice as much as you want and its gonna be on fire its gonna be great and itll sound like it its not gonna sound put together itll sound like this explosion of energy of people staring at each other and really feeding off each others vibe thats what its gonna be
8776485 if you could timewarp back to 1983 with a copy of death magentic in your hands and play it to the spotty longhaired brats whod just finished recording kill em all they would have no problem at all recognizing themselves in its epic song structures jaw dropping guitar work all buzzsaw guitars and face melting solos and sheer whiplash inducing energy in fact theyd probably be impressed thats right kids for once you can believe the hype your metallica are back and theyve brought their balls with them this time
8776486 give a man a fish and you feed him for a day teach him how to fish and you feed him for life

8776528 fantastic insight into everything wealth some of the most out of the box thought provoking insight i have ever personally received it has been inspiring
8776529 i come back to 4walls networking events every month for what i term my
8776530 will direct that service to our most pressing national challenges

8776536 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
8776537 we are making a major down payment on the fulfillment of that dream
8776538 will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8776539 words and his example inspired an entire generation of the young and old the rich and poor people of all faiths races cultures and backgrounds to believe that we had the power we had the ability and we had the capacity to make that dream a reality
8776540 tonight we witness in part what has become of his dream
8776541 would be quick to remind us that realizing his dream is not barack obamas job alone america needs more than a great president to realize my fathers dream
8776542 weve come a long way but we must march again
8776543 on nov 4th we must march in every state in every city in every village we must march to the ballot box we must march like we have never marched before
8776544 democracy is not a state it is an act it is a series of actions we must take to build what martin luther king jr called the beloved community

8776549 im really proud of the fact that weve really raised the level of our intensity despite only having 12 000 people in the stands
8776550 theyve been very professional about this thats the part i really appreciate about it also youd like to see 36 000 every night but for right now the way our guys are going about our business im very proud of them
8776551 the potential population of clients is too large so theres always a steady stream of new clients
8776552 there is great pride in this neighborhood and some of the older ladies just really let these guys have it
8776553 to shift the focus from me to the american people
8776554 to let them know that weve got a fundamental choice weve got to make and the decision we make in this election is going to set the course for this country
8776555 to nominate barack obama at the democratic national convention who may not even have been seated here 45 years ago this is big and i am very moved by it
8776556 its not only a bad economy but an unpopular party and an unpopular war but you go to the battleground states and there are a whole lot of people who are uncomfortable voting for an african american
8776557 white people who have a prejudice against black people but wont admit it
8776558 but that impression has been planted and its going to take a real hard pushback to neutralize it
8776559 hes just got to work day and night from now until election day take advantage of his youth and health
8776560 look at the judgments ive made and the judgments john mccain has made
8776561 are you better off now than you were eight years ago
8776562 hes up against a candidate who has got a very appealing personal history
8776563 the challenge will be to focus on the issues and what an obama administration will bring to average american families
8776564 the angst quite honestly some of its about race and we shouldnt lose sight of that
8776565 this election will be decided on the fundamentals not how many houses somebody has or whos elitist
8776566 im going to take them by the hand from the dormitory to the central polling place
8776567 whether its urgency a must or a need weve got to win some ball games
8776568 now we have to play the mets head to head theyre must wins
8776569 its no secret were running out of time theres no margin for error
8776570 i didnt think i had a chance to get it
8776571 that ball everyone in the stadium and everyone else thought it was out except the left fielder its a game of inches
8776572 i didnt even look at it that catch was the game
8776573 pick your poison it was either chipper or him its a decision you make sometimes it works and sometimes it gets you mccann is a major league hitter and an all star and he got us
8776574 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8776575 based on one of the biggest horror icons of all time the games name plot or what systems it will be available for have yet to be revealed
8776576 the completely new title changes things up from past renegade kid projects in terms of gameplay genre and style
8776577 our first venture with gamecock dementium was an ideal partnership for us
8776578 our new game has been a pet project of ours for a while now and it not only felt natural but necessary that we team up with gamecock again were really looking forward to working with these talented folks again
8776579 the exciting thing about working with renegade kid and what we learned the first time around is that theyll stick to their guns and put everything they have into it
8776580 this new title is incredible and a huge leap forward for them and the genre
8776581 no country for old men was epic this is a different contemporary milieu
8776582 like advise and consent this is about the personal meeting the political with melodrama burn after reading is also our version of a tony scott jason bourne kind of movie without the explosions
8776583 i think there is something random at the heart of this one
8776584 on the one hand it really is bleak and scary on the other it is really funny
8776585 its the whatever ness of it you feel that at any minute of any day in any town this could happen
8776586 but most of the things we pursue in america whether in new york l a or washington are deluded he is not alone in that i hope the film is touching on some level what is amazing is that he isnt the dumbest of the characters they all are a bit thick
8776587 when you watch a coen brothers movie it is always so certain about what it is trying to portray
8776588 that is their strength the minute they write a word they know how it will look on screen they are very purposeful with no kind of mistakes
8776589 i ran into one of the cast members from the show in london
8776590 they complained about that pain in the expletive fake alan partridge talk show
8776591 years ago i was a toy soldier come to life in the indian in the cupboard
8776592 ben and i are pretty good buddies along with owen
8776593 i loved it that dana was not a smart ass cynical guy hes an innocent and you want to root for him
8776594 i was appalled i worried about what my mother would think at the same time it made me laugh
8776595 he is an absolute master at playing buffoons hes even better than ricky gervais at being a slightly objectionable character theres something of the ass in him and he freely admits that
8776596 its a british thing hes not afraid of looking stupid he has the ability to expose the suffering of a character a lesser actor would just go for the laughs
8776597 i was under the impression that they were latvian refugees who needed shelter for the night
8776598 he was the one of the most professional people ive ever worked with he was there very early every day
8776599 what is the number one thing getting in the way of student groups being more active
8776600 warum eigentlich warum glauben die kandidaten der amerikanischen pr sidentschaft dass die israel lobby so absolut wichtig f r ihre wahl ist die j dischen stimmen sind nat rlich wichtig besonders in mehreren wichtigen staaten die das ergebnis entscheiden werden aber die afrikanisch amerikanische w hlerschaft ist gr er und die spanische gemeinde auch obama hat millionen junger w hler auf die politische b hne gebracht zahlenm ig ist die arabisch muslimische gemeinschaft in den usa auch kein unbedeutender faktor einige sagen dass es das j dische geld sei das ausschlaggebend sei die juden sind reich vielleicht geben sie mehr als andere f r politisches aber der mythos ber das m chtige j dische geld hat einen antisemitischen klang schlie lich haben auch andere lobbys und vor allem die gro en multinationalen unternehmen erhebliche geldsummen an obama und seine gegner gegeben und obama verk ndete stolz dass er hunderttausend gew hnliche b rger dahin gebracht habe ihm kleine summen zu spenden die sich auf dutzende von millionen beliefen stimmt es ist bewiesen worden dass die j dische lobby fast immer die wahl eines senators oder eines kongressmitgliedes blockieren kann der nicht eifrig nach der israelischen fl te tanzt bei einigen exemplarischen f llen die wirklich als exemplarisch geplant worden waren hat die lobby popul re politiker besiegt indem sie ihre politische und finanzielle macht f r die wahl eines praktisch unbekannten rivalen eingesetzt hat aber bei der wahl eines pr sidenten die offensichtliche kriecherei obamas gegen ber der israel lobby berragt hnliche bem hungen anderer kandidaten

8776602 the orchards top flight broad and diverse music repertoire will enrich our users music buying experience
8776603 i believe this partnership will help expand the digital music market for us and will equally benefit our artist and label partners
8776604 given the interest in several different parties to complete this testing we agreed to do so and will add the results into the public record on this proceeding
8776605 we are convinced the fcc will learn from these experiments that its proposed rules are not viable because of the impact on existing wireless providers in the neighboring spectrum bands
8776606 eviscerate claim that tdd fdd coexistence is impossible under the service rules proposed in the aws 3 proceeding
8776607 unused spectrum is a lost opportunity for the public interest
8776608 just as important the commission succumbing to endless delay tactics is also a lost opportunity
8776609 t mobile is not seeking delay and does not fear competition from m2z with or without a free service offering
8776610 t mobile simply wants to ensure that its existing customers are able to place calls and maintain communications on the aws 1 spectrum

8776614 papa what can we make lets do a project together
8776615 what the naysayers dont understand is this election has never been about me its about you
8776616 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8776617 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8776618 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8776619 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8776620 today i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8776621 america we are better than the last eight years we are a better country than this
8776622 i accept your nomination to be president of the united states
8776623 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8776624 can no longer afford four more years of the same
8776625 i think for the community theres lots of questions that need to be answered still and i think council should be equally concerned
8776626 what youre doing here is a good thing supplement it with some more conservation programs
8776627 it sounds like we are going to plan for coal coal coal
8776628 it would be great if some of that 10 million the bpw spends on coal from other states each year was spent here on other technologies
8776629 jesus is the reason for the v sign this program and will be shu whaaa

8776632 fear arousing communications usually stimulate the audience to take action to reduce the threat
8776633 when the fear producing message describes danger but the audience is not told of clear specific effective means of reducing the danger they may deal with the fear by blocking out the message or denying that it applies to them
8776634 while solid state disk drives can vastly improve random read performance and are perfectly suited to most mobile devices many operations are sequential in laptops and desktops and involve writes where ssds most often lose to magnetic hard disk drives in performance
8776635 i think you need to get to 128gb for around 200
8776636 what a week what a statement i dont know if i have seen a player like dan in big brother history before
8776637 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8776638 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
8776639 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8776640 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8776641 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8776642 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8776643 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
8776644 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
8776645 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs
8776646 i see this as a public health study not only for us but for the whole world it gives everyone the license to use both drugs interchangeably
8776647 clearly for medicare it would make economic sense to put preference on the use of avastin
8776648 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept
8776649 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8776650 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8776651 these changes will affect any federal project that affects any endangered species
8776652 if these changes had come into place fema would have been able to make that decision
8776653 to ensure that decisions arent being made for political reasons
8776654 what were looking to do is remove some of the bureaucratic red tape on common sense projects
8776655 what this doesnt do is offer a federal agency a sort of get out of jail free card
8776656 they have an expertise that is unrivaled by any other agency
8776657 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8776658 we issued shoot on sight orders in the wake of large scale violence
8776659 this is unprecedented violence much more widespread than weve ever seen
8776660 the violence against the christian community in orissa state which broke out after the reprehensible assassination
8776661 so far a total of nine persons have been killed in various incidents
8776662 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8776663 we hope to develop these techniques further and apply them to more volcanoes worldwide
8776664 potentially these techniques could extend our knowledge of volcanic recharge considerably as they can be applied to material erupted before volcanic monitoring was commonplace
8776665 we hope that what we find in the crystals in terms of timescales can be linked with phenomena such as earthquakes
8776666 if we can relate the timescales we measure to such events we may be able to say when we could expect a volcano to erupt
8776667 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8776668 with its mechanisms murky diagnosis tricky incidence under reported treatment uncertain and personal societal and economic tolls enormous tbi is a clear crisis for the u s military
8776669 as neurons are damaged chemicals and neurotransmitters get released in mass quantities the blood brain barrier might be compromised and calcium from your body could get into your brain all that is toxic to brain cells so you have further damage going on over the course of hours or days after the injury
8776670 you can see where the pathways have been stretched and where there are holes so you have a better idea of how much damage has been done and to what parts of the brain
8776671 but the idea is that you could take sample and know whether the person has had a brain injury how severe it is and whether theres ongoing brain damage from hour to hour based on the biomarkers present in the blood
8776672 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8776673 they know they did something wrong and they were still ignorant
8776674 at first i just wanted an apology now because they want ed to be ignorant and rude i have to take it to the next level
8776675 as the officers were in the lower apartment one of the detectives reviewed the search warrant application and realized it was for the upper apartment
8776676 it appears to be an honest mistake and we certainly apologize to all involved
8776677 we can say comfortably that over 1 100 search warrants were executed last year and 580 to date this year and that with such a high volume and such a fast paced environment it is understandable that mistakes could happen
8776678 the way they make it seem is we can do whatever we want
8776679 its a sad situation ive always looked up to the police ive always expected them to be on my side
8776680 i dont know what was going on upstairs but it gives police no right to bust in my doors
8776681 police have been faced with fortified doors and windows in numerous locations theyve been met with individuals armed with weapons or attacking animals
8776682 my 12 year old and 6 year old dont want to be home at all
8776683 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8776684 when i talk to my students about credit cards theyre learning to be very jaded and very distrusting as well they should be
8776685 it may be that they just dont have the money to file for bankruptcy maybe their parents are helping them out
8776686 our guess is they still have as much debt as they had before but theyre just postponing it
8776687 i would expect the numbers are going to go up up up
8776688 theyre not going to come down theyre going to go through the roof
8776689 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8776690 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8776691 based on our discussions it was determined that it would probably be in dr paxtons best interest and the colleges best interest that he resign as president
8776692 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8776693 i think you and i both knew he was back
8776694 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so
8776695 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
8776696 you have to interact effectively with your pro am partners you need to be able to do media interviews and you need to give a winners acceptance speech in english
8776697 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
8776698 what were seeing is that a handful of players dont speak to the level they need to be
8776699 american businesses and consumers were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
8776700 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited
8776701 but the bigger picture is that there hasnt really been a major breakdown considering all the bad headlines out there from higher oil prices to the credit crisis and troubled housing sector
8776702 the strength in durable goods is just the latest indication that manufacturing is actually holding in quite well and thats a really big plus
8776703 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff
8776704 i was so angered by their sneakiness that i paid off and terminated my citicard account immediately
8776705 less risky borrowers will have to absorb the costs posed by riskier borrowers if issuers cant price everyone based on the risk they pose
8776706 now more than ever we need to end unfair and deceptive credit card lending practices that make it difficult for consumers to control their credit and manage their debt
8776707 drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution
8776708 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8776709 sometimes you can pick the moment but sometimes the moment picks you
8776710 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8776711 my butt dyno says a slight increase in power and the quick starts and smooth idle are nice too i havent seen the better fuel economy yet but its still early down side is that i broke two of these things installing them and at 25 a piece
8776712 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8776713 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8776714 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8776715 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8776716 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8776717 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8776718 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8776719 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8776720 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8776721 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8776722 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8776723 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8776724 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8776725 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8776726 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8776727 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8776728 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8776729 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8776730 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8776731 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8776732 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8776733 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8776734 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8776735 he has 300 foreign policy advisers and for his convention speech a football stadium equipped with a movie set that looks like a greek temple
8776736 he claims to be the one that we have been waiting for and he can lower the seas and promise and deliver universal love simply by showing up
8776737 the polls are overestimating obama just as he is overestimating himself
8776738 obama ites are all over the place passing out volunteer cards
8776739 we cant tell god what to do if god wants to send a storm weve got to get out of the way
8776740 you can have 1 million but if you die youre broke
8776741 its hitting me strange im never a person to worry or panic i am now
8776742 i told my wife wherever we evacuate youd better like it because were staying there
8776743 we did go and pick up some refills yesterday so the medicine we have will tie us over for a couple of weeks
8776744 i need to go by the bank have a little spending cash
8776745 ive always kept them ready to go at a moments notice
8776746 i just fear its time to move on if it happens again
8776747 if it happens once its once in a lifetime if it happens twice youll never feel comfortable
8776748 they have them in other places but they dont taste the same
8776749 ive been here most of my life and my husband has been here most of his and there is no place like new orleans there is no place like home
8776750 he comes every six months for a routine checkup around a month ago a checkup was conducted and he was in perfect health
8776751 the dalai lama is fine hes just exhausted he has had a hectic schedule for the last year with events scheduled almost every day he just returned from france two days ago
8776752 has a little bit of discomfort in his stomach he is going for a checkup now
8776753 college students are going to drink no matter what the drinking age is
8776754 maybe this way it could teach responsibility at a younger age
8776755 at this point would have a negative effect for a period of time yet the long term effect as in maybe 5 20 years might be rather desirable
8776756 the thing is that in order to make it work as it does in other countries we as americans need to be more united in our families
8776757 i think it comes down to what your parents instill in you
8776758 though it appears on the surface that we dropped a ranking
8776759 there is something like 600 questions which we respond to so there is a lot more that shows in the submission than the formula
8776760 ive worked in this profession for almost 37 years and thats a long time i have a desire to have a different rhythm to my life
8776761 the work i have done here at the ua has been the pinnacle of the work in my career and i dont have a desire to do it anywhere else
8776762 when i was invited for my first visit to the ua in 1998 i was struck by how pretty this place is and by how warm and friendly people are here but the thing that resonated most with me is when i spoke with then chancellor john a white
8776763 i recognized the opportunity to be on the ground floor of a transformative process because of his vision for where he wanted the ua to go nationally was simply appealing
8776764 i had made a decision at the end of the academic year last summer to retire before i knew anything about provost smith or chancellor whites decision to retire
8776765 in consultation with the new chancellor we decided to extend my time here for another semester to allow him time to transition into his position and have some stability in the division of student affairs
8776766 we are always pleased to be included among the best academic schools in the nation by the princeton review
8776767 the ua has been working very hard to become an environmentally sustainable institution and it is satisfying to see that work recognized
8776768 when sami puts her mind to something she works hard for it until she gets it
8776769 i think shes very capable shes not bashful and im extremely proud of her
8776770 she knows what she wants and is going for it shes talked about running but i didnt know she was actually going to go through with it until she got out of college
8776771 we would like to be more diligent in our efforts to control drinking and driving this year
8776772 ill the call the police if im aware of someone driving drunk
8776773 long and sad record of embracing partial birth abortion and the homosexual agenda
8776774 by the fact that while claiming to be an observant jew he has been misrepresenting and falsifying to the american people the teachings of the torah against partial birth infanticide against special privileges and preferential treatment for flaunting homosexuals and against religious intermarriage of jews
8776775 violated our sacred torah by his senate votes upholding partial birth infanticide and legitimizing homosexuality which abnormal and unhealthy behavior the torah strongly condemns as sinful and immoral
8776776 we excommunicated him to show that serious orthodox jews consider what lieberman was doing a betrayal of the most basic values of our holy torah that excommunication even though not widely acknowledged is still one hundred percent spiritually valid
8776777 serious religious jews who understand that the most important issues facing our country are the moral issues and know senator liebermans long and sad record of embracing partial birth abortion and the homosexual agenda realize that hes the wrong choice for vice president or for any high position in a mccain administration
8776778 we call upon christian pro family leaders such as gary bauer james dobson don wildmon tony perkins et al
8776779 the duncan apartments are for juniors and seniors who have completed 45 hours of class time we want them to feel like they are off campus but are still secure
8776780 students walk with a mission and it is very easy for them to point out an outsider
8776781 this is the first time in a long time that ive actually felt an emotion about the game of football
8776782 were taking a young football team on the field and letting them loose i cant wait to feel the crowd and see what this is all about
8776783 im anxious to see how we perform and to see how the freshmen react under pressure
8776784 ive been leading by example im not a big woohoo and holler guy but ive been leading by working hard and will continue that into the game
8776785 elton ford is going to be a wonderful football player
8776786 we are going to have growing pains with him but he sees things breaks well and hes starting to play the game pretty good
8776787 discovered a common desire to reopen public debate over the drinking age
8776788 21 is not working as well as the public may think
8776789 theres no question about that if it could have played out any other way i would have loved to see it play out a different way
8776790 but with the falcons and with arkansas it was really the only way that it could play out it was certainly a trying situation and everybody there worked as hard as they could to do the best job they could
8776791 if he can leave players here what makes you think he wont leave the players hes going to coach im just afraid to see what happens if he does bad at arkansas
8776792 when he is out here at practice he is serious and doesnt like to laugh he doesnt like to clap his hands or do anything he likes to play football and get things right but off the field he jokes with you and talks to you as a person and not a football player
8776793 the kids have been working really hard and theyre ready to play someone else
8776794 right off the bat this will test us to let us know exactly where were at
8776795 we just wanted freshmen to find a connection with the university that created a sense of pride tradition and respect
8776796 we didnt want to make people feel like they were on a schedule we wanted it to seem like we were building friendships
8776797 i have been to china before and i have been to the olympics before but obviously never to the olympics in china
8776798 an important moment in history for modern china and for the rest of the world
8776799 my major interests involve international relations the media politics and sports and this involved all of those interests
8776800 the thing that always makes game one a challenge at this level is facing a new coaching staff and thats what were facing in arkansas
8776801 we dont have a real handle on their schemes or their alignments on defense or offense so that just adds to the challenge
8776802 and when you lose someone like we did in losing coach patterson all the players have focused a little bit more and the coaching staff has picked up their pace
8776803 i have things in the works and im going to try to pursue a music career and get things going in a bigger city and bigger market
8776804 i try not to limit myself to a style each song is different from one another and i try to let the song write itself
8776805 a few years ago the music scene had a dip and started lacking because there was not a lot of great talent and there was a lot of band animosity
8776806 but now its gotten to a point where we have some really great musicians and bands and we all have a commodity and are trying to help each other out
8776807 its going to be hard to give that up to go to a big city where ill be a small fish on a totem pole
8776808 ive grown up here have friends family and roots here its definitely home and i will definitely be back
8776809 putins labyrinth spies murder and the dark heart of the new russia

8776813 lavacot said that jackson because of his mental state was unaware that he was breaking any laws during the chase
8776814 the law says you have to have criminal intent he didnt have it
8776815 you can analogize this to somebody whose child is dying
8776816 are they going to slow down or stop and wait for an ambulance
8776817 take it from me if that election had ended differently we wouldnt be bogged down in iraq
8776818 i believe this election is close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change this election represents
8776819 some of the best marketers have the worst products and thats certainly true of todays republican party
8776820 broken politics in washington and the failed by dave wedge denver bay state gov deval patrick spent the day today cruising radio row
8776821 going out on the opening drive and scoring a touchdown is the way you want to start any game
8776822 it was a great job by david carr coming in and leading the offense it was a good start gives us a little momentum and a little confidence boost so were excited about starting the season
8776823 at the end of the day its not time to even talk about those things for various different reasons
8776824 you know nintendo whos still our silent partner a lot of people dont know that we have a great relationship with those guys its not time to talk about eternal darkness 2 its been interpreted a couple of times where ive said were working on eternal darkness 2 ive never said that
8776825 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8776826 even late today we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate administration proceedings
8776827 we arrived at 9am more than three hours before our flight and waited for 45 minutes then we were told that the flight had been delayed due to technical problems
8776828 we were told to check back and some people left the airport but we have been waiting here as we had nowhere to go and had limited currency weve just found out whats happened and my husband is trying to phone the credit card company now to see where we stand
8776829 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8776830 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8776831 its very very important that we play the way we practiced and trained over the last year and a half
8776832 theres a way that we operate theres a chain of command theres a way that we interact with each other and we cant afford to be in a disorganized way as we confront the challenges that were going to see here
8776833 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8776834 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
8776835 we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8776836 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8776837 eight years in his state legislature in springfield illinois and one term in congress
8776838 i am much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
8776839 probably was shaped more by his fathers absence than his presence
8776840 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8776841 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8776842 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8776843 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8776844 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100m americans its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8776845 born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8776846 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8776847 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8776848 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8776849 but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes
8776850 because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
8776851 i would love to do a guitar hero movie if activision would ever let me
8776852 im trying to convince them but why would you have a movie screw up such a huge franchise not that i would make a bad movie
8776853 it could be about a kid from a small town who dreams of being a rock star and he wins the guitar hero competition
8776854 because of their indifference to facts their readiness to sacrifice the long term for the short term subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short circuit the rule of law
8776855 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the
8776856 overall unpatched systems and lack of user awareness coupled with the number of people freely roaming the internet makes these rce vulnerabilities more profitable and more easily exploitable than the remote attacks from days gone by
8776857 were seeing a lot of the same things weve seen in the past in regards to whats being patched as far as ie and its as important as ever for microsoft
8776858 forefront client security helps organizations better protect users against malware and spyware across multiple microsoft platforms from small businesses to large enterprises
8776859 agent protection on windows server 2008 server and core server role support and protection for windows server 2008 except core which is client only agent protection and server roles on hyper v agent protection on cluster servers agent protection on home editions of windows vista or later windows xp sp2 or later windows 2000 sp4 and windows server 2003 sp1 or later nap integration
8776860 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed
8776861 the most eloquent discussion about the world as it is and the world that it should be and that was it really after that day that was it i was in love with him
8776862 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8776863 we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8776864 if you commit to serving your community or our country we will make sure you can afford a college education
8776865 i will makes sure those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most
8776866 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperment and judgment to be commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8776867 ik heb mijn vader al een lange tijd niet gezien of gesproken dus alles wat hij zegt over mij te weten is gelogen
8776868 ik wil dat hij stopt met het pijn doen van en het met de media te praten over de mensen van wie ik hou

8776911 we could see just by looking at the images that some layers looked different
8776912 some were coarser grain some finer grain it gives us clues to the conditions of the environment
8776913 we dont know if this was a mechanical fault or a sudden strain of the motor because maybe the other wheels slipped on some loose soil but when it occurred everybody sat back and thought about the condition we were in

8776922 after a very thorough and demanding tender process for our high volume weekly titles i am delighted to renew our agreement with polestar to produce this portfolio of market leading magazines
8776923 in the course of the last five years polestar has invested in and transformed its business into one of the highest quality printers in the uk both in terms of quality and service the renewal of this contract demonstrates the degree of faith which we have in their company and its staff
8776924 ipc media has been a bedrock to polestar for many years by trusting polestar to produce such a large portfolio of mass run titles they both recognise and support our position as market leading magazine printer
8776925 although our relationship goes back a long way polestar understands that as a print supplier operating in todays climate success is all about what you deliver moving forward not what you have done in the past that is why it is such fantastic news for polestar that ipc media has validated our relationship for a further five years

8776931 epson is a world leader in print technology with a reputation for manufacturing high quality printers that produce superior image quality
8776932 our ongoing relationship with epson enables onyx to bring our expertise in color workflow for solvent printing to the table and together we have developed tools that deliver exceptional and consistent results

8776944 we are excited to be associated with the delta mod tech edge converting system

8776958 i saw the new suprasetter 162 at drupa in d sseldorf for me as a large format printer it was one of the shows highlights this initial impression has been confirmed by our first experiences of actually using the system we are particularly impressed by the plate imaging overall productivity and reliability
8776959 since the suprasetter series was launched in 2004 its thermal laser technology has proved highly effective and has undergone further development on an ongoing basis ensuring reliable stable processes and high imaging quality the new models ensure our customers enjoy the same quality of cutting edge technology for the new large format at prepress as they do at the press stage
8776960 customers supply their files to us digitally as pdfs our prepress uses both macs and pcs and these operate within our state of the art ecrm workmates news prepress workflow that culminates in plates being imaged computer to plate and processed
8776961 it preflights each file automatically and finds any errors a very common error is that images will be in rgb format instead of cmyk or spot colors need to be converted to cmyk or black the software can fix these automatically as well as resolving any other problems with the file we can preset the criteria workmates news then automatically imposes pairs pages and proofs them whats more the workmates news software even sends the presets to the quickset software that produces a printout for the pressman to guide color adjustment on the ink fountains time savings just add up
8776962 files have to be right before they can be imaged to plate
8776963 our prepress workflow must dependably prep the files so that theyre consistently correct weve chosen our people and prepress technology with extra care to make sure plates flow to the press right on schedule and ready to print ecrm workmates news software does it all its easy to learn and use and it delivers for fsp every day

8776976 this election is our chance to keep the american promise alive
8776977 take it from me if the 2000 presidential election had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8776978 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would not be showing contempt for the constiution wed be protecting the rights of every ameircan today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 because john mccain is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8776979 there are times in the history of our nation when our very way of life depends upon awakening to the challenge of a present danger shaking off complacency to rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of embracing change
8776980 this election is our chance to keep the american promise alive
8776981 this election is our chance to keep the american promise alive
8776982 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering cabin adjacent to the second main cabin doors
8776983 the cylinders been propelled up with significant force to do the damage that it has and its happened very quickly so it probably would have been a matter of seconds
8776984 these oxygen bottles are actually quite robust so it would take some significant force to do some damage like that
8776985 theres nothing at this stage that the atsb can identify that could have been done to prevent this we dont really know why the bottle failed thats the key question for the investigation
8776986 anythings possible its certainly a rare event but no one can discount the possibility of those sort of things happening
8776987 as far as we can tell from all the information thats available to us the crew have pretty much done a textbook response

8777005 it was the same way of thinking that led him to get it right when he opposed the war in iraq when he warned of its consequences thats the judgement of a leader
8777006 saw a leader with the understanding to build new bridges over old divides
8777007 i saw a leader with the courage to confront corruption directly with the president of kenya
8777008 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8777009 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8777010 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8777011 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
8777012 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger
8777013 after they wrecked our economy its time for a change
8777014 after they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us its time for a change
8777015 powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8777016 barack obamas vision and his voice represent the best of america
8777017 it is that common american identity which barack obama exemplifies heart and soul that enables us as americans to speak with moral authority to all of the people of the world
8777018 traffic has been very light through the area this rush hour which will allow for a safe and speedy closure
8777019 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8777020 i feel like i just have to continue to make plays
8777021 i was released and no teams were calling so i started making plans as if i wasnt going to be on a team
8777022 we have not been fully staffed for a long time so weve been building up to this time
8777023 shall be open to the public for the provision of all court services for nine consecutive hours between 7 30 a m to 5 30 p m
8777024 in theory well have the same amount of work but it will be spread over a longer period of time
8777025 it was an amicable arrangement to part ways were trying to help them any way we can
8777026 expenses not billable under the agreement and for subcontractor expenses which were not in fact incurred by turner on the project
8777027 obviously having an african american who could be president is important and simultaneously having a woman who got so far its a whole turning point in the 21st century
8777028 for us this is the first presidential election where we get to vote
8777029 this is history in the making and im right here in the middle of it
8777030 im learning tons about my government im also learning a lot about myself ive been inspired to reach out help and advocate for issues i care about
8777031 i think its the most historical thing that ive ever witnessed that ive ever been a part of
8777032 one thing thats really important to me is how the party has come together
8777033 and they did it so intentionally and thoughtfully if there were any questions about unity it was absolutely clear that this is a united team
8777034 i havent talked to every clinton delegate but so many are comfortable with obama now
8777035 work with each other on a private and voluntary basis
8777036 consistently perform at a poorer economic level than states without
8777037 will we wait for certain proof before we act to avoid disaster
8777038 obama has been getting six times the contributions from military personnel as mccain
8777039 the united states simply has no real leverage on russia in the caucasus
8777040 it would have been far better to try quiet diplomacy and try to work with russia behind the scenes
8777041 we have squandered a great part of what we might have used and have not stopped to conserve the exceeding bounty of nature without which our genius for enterprise would have been worthless and impotent scorning to be careful shamefully prodigal as well as admirably efficient
8777042 with the great government went many deep secret things which we too long delayed to look into and scrutinize with candid fearless eyes
8777043 the great government we loved has too often been made use of for private and selfish purposes and those who used it had forgotten the people
8777044 we reared giant machinery which made it impossible that any but those who stood at the levers of control should have a chance to look out for themselves
8777045 the nation has been deeply stirred by a solemn passion stirred by the knowledge of wrong of ideals lost of government too often debauched and made an instrument of evil
8777046 some old things with which we had grown familiar and which had begun to creep into the very habit of our thought and of our lives have altered their aspect as we have latterly looked critically upon them with fresh awakened eyes have dropped their disguises and shown themselves alien and sinister
8777047 there can be no equality of opportunity the first essential of justice in the body politic if men and women and children be not shielded in their lives in their very vitality from the consequences of great industrial and social processes which they cannot alter control or singly cope with
8777048 we have been refreshed by a new insight into our own life
8777049 sometimes they can get carried away you know throwing fruit from their drinks
8777050 once i was playing the villain and i got nailed on the head with the flash cube from a camera
8777051 it could be a dance school or a concert venue there are all kinds of things
8777052 it would be nice to see it as an arts space see the places history continue
8777053 we would come once a year to steal material and then go back
8777054 once we had a whole group of british parliamentarians in here including winston churchills son
8777055 the head of a large african american denomination challenged the party on abortion
8777056 he has 300 foreign policy advisers and for his convention speech a football stadium equipped with a movie set that looks like a greek temple
8777057 he claims to be the one that we have been waiting for and he can lower the seas and promise and deliver universal love simply by showing up
8777058 the polls are overestimating obama just as he is overestimating himself
8777059 obama ites are all over the place passing out volunteer cards

8777061 oh yes but sometimes i wonder if my biological father looks like me at all
8777062 i was taken aback by their love its very difficult to imagine if he was at all an adopted child
8777063 since i was too young when i left nepal i dont remember anything so well as to miss it oh yes but sometimes i wonder if my biological father looks like me at all
8777064 but since i was yet to be self dependent i couldnt come before
8777065 its the bad face of the president for me the president of the french republic has to be presidential
8777066 im not sure about what exactly yet however i would like to open a good orphanage here and thats just a beginning ill try to contribute my best

8777073 what is the definition of a first time home buyer
8777074 only homes purchased on or after april 9 2008 and before july 1 2009 are eligible

8777078 does the credit amount differ based on tax filing status
8777079 if i go to hell i get to meet all my friends
8777080 weve heard that a number of cities have looked at this
8777081 but now when you get used to it its good i do think its a good idea
8777082 now a lot of them can handle city business on their way to work or on their way home so they dont have to make a special trip to city hall
8777083 he gives a great teleprompter speech but when the teleprompter gets turned off hes not so hot
8777084 i think its fair to say the country is behind on infrastructure i think everybody recognizes that on both sides of the aisle
8777085 this is senator mccains decision and his announcement and we all want to be respectful of his desire to have the chance to announce it himself
8777086 it is very difficult to try a homicide multiple decades after the crime
8777087 well be carefully reviewing our options and will determine whether or not we can go forward were not going to give up easily on something as serious as the murder of a police officer
8777088 reversal of clarks conviction is necessary to ensure fairness and integrity of the judicial process
8777089 but it doesnt take anything away from what this did to both families
8777090 weve always felt he was wrongly convicted and there wasnt sufficient evidence were tremendously pleased with this decision
8777091 bottom line clark received a fair trial and the jury made a just decision
8777092 life as we planned it was taken away in 1970
8777093 i watched my children wait by the window for their daddy to come home
8777094 based on our discussions it was determined that it would probably be in dr paxtons best interest and the colleges best interest that he resign as president
8777095 down in the shadow of the penitentiary out by the gas fires of the refinery ten years burnin down the road nowhere to run aint got nowhere to go
8777096 one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8777097 lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty
8777098 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8777099 the united states is now more dependent on foreign oil than it ever was
8777100 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8777101 a growing body of evidence strongly suggests that ucla is cheating on admissions
8777102 specifically applicants often reveal their own race on the essay portion of the application
8777103 the readers are instructed repeatedly not to consider race at all
8777104 theres circumstantial evidence to suggest some back door racial preferences are going on
8777105 i highly doubt that anyone is going to be admitted to one of the most important universities in the nation if they dont qualify
8777106 before one can make a judgment like that i think other things need to be explored
8777107 i dont think he was trying to deceive the voters
8777108 it is the process you have to go through if you want to change a statement based on the deadline
8777109 city officials falsified costs of the anniversary photo display by claiming volunteers built easels instead a single contractor pocketed over 23 000 for building easels
8777110 by that date well have to have a probable cause hearing or an indictment which may be issued beforehand
8777111 during some of his robberies he was apologetic and said he needed the money for his family

8777115 sokongan ahli parlimen dari sabah dan sarawak tidak berbelah bagi kepada pucuk pimpinan bn dan kita akan sentiasa bersama bn walaupun ada cerita di luar sana bahawa kononnya ada ura ura ahli parlimen dari kedua dua negeri nak melompat parti
8777116 saya telah bercakap dengan eric majimbun dan chua soon bui pagi ini semalam saya berjumpa mereka dan mereka memberi jaminan kepada saya bahawa mereka masih kekal bersama bn
8777117 kami akan memberi jaminan kami dan akan menandatanganinya dan menyerahkannya kepada perdana menteri hanya untuk memastikan tiadanya spekulasi
8777118 the cap prides itself on providing pathologists with the highest caliber of timely practical continuing medical education therefore recognition of our efforts by an external accrediting body is most encouraging
8777119 we are very proud of having attained this level of recognition
8777120 as our goal is to help our members excel in all areas of laboratory medicine and ensure the highest caliber of patient care this award certainly attests to the effectiveness of our efforts
8777121 i am glad the nfl took a second good hard look at the case
8777122 brandon was thrilled its as good as we expected or hoped for
8777123 i think the best word i can use is were just trying to get some closure
8777124 we never want to send anyone out there thats not 100 percent were no more pessimistic about him today than we were but when he goes out there again we want him to be able to pitch with peace of mind
8777125 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8777126 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8777127 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8777128 give me one good reason why barrack obama should be president
8777129 its the middle of the day but there are no people and no cars around its too quiet thats a classic combat indicator there may be an ied improvised explosive device up ahead
8777130 stay in the middle of the road gunner scan the balconies and side streets for a spotter
8777131 weve got a lot of commitments with iraq and afghanistan at the moment
8777132 the ideal solution would be to take soldiers in a convoy down to the centre of salisbury on a saturday afternoon but im not sure the shoppers would like having machine guns pointed at them very much
8777133 virtual training is safe and it maximises the benefits of real life training it even means that someone who doesnt have a driving licence can gain experience of driving in a convoy
8777134 when i first saw it i didnt know how useful it was going to be but the trainings been really helpful
8777135 we all play computer games but this isnt just a game its serious
8777136 im sure its going to help me when i get out to theatre
8777137 caring matters deeply to individuals families and society in general
8777138 sustaining the ability of carers to provide the care and support they give to others is of critical importance
8777139 the current system is enormously complicated and even department for work and pensions staff struggle to correctly identify and clearly explain the benefits that carers and their families are entitled to
8777140 it is crucial that the government takes action to boost carers incomes as a matter of urgency
8777141 the two tier benefit recommended by the committee would be a major improvement to the current system
8777142 carers need a separate benefit which recognises that they are not unemployed but are making an important contribution to society
8777143 we are working with employers to ensure that carers can have a better balance between their work and caring responsibilities
8777144 the government is committed to reviewing the care and support system as part of the longer term welfare reform programme
8777145 we welcome this report which is a valuable contribution to the debate we will study the recommendations and respond to them in due course
8777146 the customer relations angle clearly works against the idea of taking a strike
8777147 i dont think it is going to change the number or types of cases we do
8777148 filip said at a news conference at the new york stock exchange according to reuters
8777149 the proof will be in the pudding as to how theyre applied
8777150 but its a clear admission on the justice departments part that the previous guidelines were inappropriate and went too far
8777151 we know a lot about exposure to lead and we know what the exposure pathways are
8777152 the fact that we have these huge percentages of the whole distribution chain signing up to phase out lead wheel weights is a tremendous gain and 2011 is not that far off
8777153 retailers may need to ask themselves are they missing a boat here
8777154 were trying to figure out how to do something similar online
8777155 grandparents are in a better position to lend a hand in tough times
8777156 its crazy but its the way things are going right now
8777157 a little bit of hubris and pride thinking we conquered all these other segments and here is an opportunity to put the marlboro man out of a ford and into a toyota
8777158 certainly the market has been surprised in the truck area but we have full confidence its going to return in the future
8777159 the asian culture thinks in years and decades not months and quarters
8777160 it would have taken a lot of discipline to stay out of this thing
8777161 if they laid off san antonio workers for three months that would be the shot heard round the world
8777162 if i were in texas i think any sane person would say the market is awful and this crazy company is actually keeping people employed
8777163 plan 10 30 40 years ahead of time and they didnt foresee this
8777164 it could force closer scrutiny of toyotas agreement that led to creation of the plant
8777165 they said they were going to call back and they never called back
8777166 instead of prize with the requisite request for personal information
8777167 our goal is to increase the visibility of the contribution of solar energy and the potential of solar energy to increase the clean energy mix in our country
8777168 were going to be moving into a whole new administration and congress and we are teeing up and making sure that people see the technology is available now deployable now and its just a matter of making it a priority
8777169 it is difficult to understand why senators would choose to protect an income tax loophole for billionaire hedge fund managers instead of creating hundreds of thousands of renewable energy jobs
8777170 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity
8777171 some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8777172 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8777173 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8777174 john mccain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes but were the ones who will pay for his flip flops
8777175 i have a question for you is anyone here going to miss
8777176 not where we imagine them to be but where we know them to be like afghanistan and pakistan
8777177 while i was learning how to put my faith into action in honduras was doing the same thing on the streets of south side chicago empowering people to rebuild their communities and reclaim their lives after the steel plants closed down
8777178 does anybody here have a little bit of faith tonight
8777179 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
8777180 when as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president and
8777181 it will be my chance to talk about a comprehensive bill obama says he wants a bill i think its got a chance next year
8777182 im not sure how many people are watching c span or cnn at 3 or 4 in the afternoon
8777183 let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8777184 defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8777185 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8777186 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy
8777187 so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8777188 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8777189 a large number of people here are here from the battleground state of colorado
8777190 this year the road to the white house cuts straight through the american west
8777191 its fitting that the eyes of the nation are on colorado fitting that the change that we need in washington begins in the rocky mountain west
8777192 quite a few voters still on the fence but this is a transition
8777193 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8777194 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8777195 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8777196 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8777197 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8777198 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of
8777199 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8777200 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and
8777201 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8777202 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8777203 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8777204 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8777205 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8777206 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8777207 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8777208 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8777209 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8777210 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and
8777211 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8777212 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8777213 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8777214 i have a much higher i q than you do
8777215 buy a majority stake in tecmo at at 920 yen per share
8777216 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8777217 its not that john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8777218 if that were our intent we would not be working as feverishly as we are weve been going down a lot of avenues to emerge from bankruptcy
8777219 in our view if delphi has a proper business plan in place it has the necessary cash flow to be a viable business
8777220 but the clock is ticking and time is getting short if this becomes a liquidation then our 8 billion claim would swamp any claim the creditors have we are trying to get everyones attention
8777221 they have to understand there is only so much that we can do theyre going to have to do their own form of self help here
8777222 it is not at all clear a stand alone reorganization is feasible for this company given the challenges in the financing markets and the u s auto market
8777223 raising money debt or equity for an auto supplier is extremely difficult and only getting worse
8777224 for dip to trade at 80 cents says people have no confidence it will come out of bankruptcy
8777225 it has no stand alone plan or an exit financing so its going on a hope and a prayer
8777226 dip lenders are probably going to demand gm put in a lot of money maybe cover the dip themselves or pay down first lien or demand some sort of preferred equity in delphi it will be very difficult
8777227 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8777228 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8777229 i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8777230 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
8777231 more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet
8777232 more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8777233 the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of
8777234 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8777235 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8777236 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8777237 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states
8777238 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted
8777239 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive
8777240 when you look at their arsenal price is really their only weapon
8777241 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8777242 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8777243 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8777244 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8777245 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8777246 i think what i experienced so far is girls when they play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots
8777247 many times they play matches of their life not only in womens tennis also in mens
8777248 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8777249 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08
8777250 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8777251 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8777252 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8777253 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8777254 i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8777255 a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division
8777256 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8777257 i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent
8777258 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8777259 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8777260 the new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurement because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8777261 the developing world is poorer than we thought but no less successful in the fight against poverty
8777262 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015 and that poverty has fallen by about 1percentage point a year since 1981 however the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa

8777272 i dont think they are going to put on a case in the future with a
8777273 after all this they are still my brothers i wish them the best
8777274 i still believe this case should have went before a military court for the simple fact that military jurors have an easier time understanding what happens in combat
8777275 we may not agree on abortion but we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies

8777289 on july 4th we didnt see the volumes we had expected
8777290 its no secret weve been evaluating a specific monthly data usage or bandwidth threshold for our comcast high speed internet residential customers for some time
8777291 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
8777292 this is the same system we have in place today
8777293 the only difference is that we will now provide a limit by which a customer may be contacted as part of our pre existing policy we will continue to contact the top users of our high speed internet service and ask them to curb their usage if a customer uses more than 250 gb and is one of the top users of our service he or she may be contacted by comcast to notify them of excessive use at that time well tell them exactly how much data per month they had used we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8777294 while my earlier action to have the citys judgment claims fund pay this fine is legally defensible it is clear that it is not politically acceptable and creates the appearance that i somehow feel that the citys ethics sanctions do not apply to me that is not the case and not the impression that i want to give to the citizens of seattle
8777295 i did not believe this charge was either fair or accurate and i challenged it in a two day hearing
8777296 however i lost that battle and i concede that fact
8777297 it would be my hope that some future problems could be avoided by such an action
8777298 i am bothered that my actions have created the impression of self importance or arrogance that is not the legacy i want to leave when my tenure is over
8777299 dreams can be one if they unite in a stirring new crusade for change in a riotous finale to the historic democratic national convention in colorado today
8777300 people of every creed and colour from every walk of life heard
8777301 we cannot walk alone king cried and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8777302 america we cannot turn back the 47 year old illinois senator said as he vowed to turn back the turmoil of the past eight years and the
8777303 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it senator obama said
8777304 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8777305 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office he said
8777306 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8777307 america we are better than these eight years senator obama said
8777308 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8777309 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight he said
8777310 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight is enough
8777311 dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe senator obama said
8777312 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8777313 i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home he vowed
8777314 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8777315 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
8777316 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition

8777318 mit tiefer dankbarkeit und gro er demut nehme ich die nominierung f r die pr sidentschaft der vereinigten staaten von amerika an
8777319 es ist zeit amerika zu ver ndern und daher kandidiere ich f r das pr sidentenamt der vereinigten staaten
8777320 amerika wir sind besser als diese letzten acht jahre wir sind ein besseres land als dieses wir lieben dieses land zu sehr als dass die kommenden vier jahre aussehen wie die vergangenen acht
8777321 am 4 november m ssen wir aufstehen und sagen acht jahre sind genug
8777322 ich wei nicht wie es euch geht aber ich bin nicht bereit nur eine zehnprozentige chance auf einen wandel zu w hlen
8777323 w re stolz auf auf barack obama gewesen stolz auf die partei die ihn nominiert hat und stolz auf das amerika das ihn w hlen wird
8777324 amerika braucht mehr als einen gro en pr sidenten um den traum meines vaters zu verwirklichen

8777327 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8777328 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8777329 it is that promise thats always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well thats why i stand here tonight
8777330 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8777331 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8777332 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know its because john mccain doesnt get it
8777333 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8777334 when we talked about an open convention this is what democrats meant
8777335 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8777336 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done

8777338 its my understanding that mike was unprepared to write during the strike
8777339 this is an indication again that the new regime at fairfax media is embarking on a low quality approach to journalism
8777340 the management is prepared to trample on anyone who gets in their way and the people who will lose out in this case are the sydney morning herald readers
8777341 we have a number of staff who are contractually exempt from industrial action
8777342 the plan is to continue to put out the newspapers absolutely as normal and we are well advanced in doing that
8777343 we see no concern in getting the papers out tonight saturday and sunday and monday and beyond if necessary
8777344 brutal said further bureau mergers and cuts were being considered
8777345 we have got a problem now with the company it is being run by people who dont have ink in their veins
8777346 and this latest act is basically bowing to the market and saying weve got a market downturn here and what do we do we reach for the knife this is really a pretty brutal way of doing it
8777347 in discussion that weve had in the last couple of days theyve said not only the canberra bureaux of the two great newspapers are on the table but also so too are foreign bureaux
8777348 you can slim it down to one bureau in canberra covering everything but you end up diminishing the analysis of the democratic process and very seriously so

8777350 tonight we gather here in denver because we still have a dream we still have a dream
8777351 with the nomination of senator barack obama tonight the man who will lead the democratic party in the fight for the white house we are making a down payment on the fulfillment of that dream
8777352 as a participant in the civil rights movement i can tell you that the road to victory will not be easy some of us were beaten arrested taken to jail and some of us were even killed trying to register to vote
8777353 represents the beginning of a new movement in american political history
8777354 it was easier to walk across that bridge and face those state troopers and be beaten and left bloody
8777355 this has been hard this has been difficult but there comes a time when you have to make a decision
8777356 yes weve come a long way but we still have a distance to go
8777357 we must march again on november 4 in every state in every city in every village in every hamlet we must march to the ballot box we must march like we never marched before to elect the next president of the united states senator barack obama
8777358 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8777359 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the polices of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8777360 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8777361 his experience has taught him something that career politicians often overlook
8777362 that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8777363 we can tell republicans and independents as well as democrats why our nation needs a change from the approach of bush cheney and mccain
8777364 after they wrecked our economy it is time for a change after they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us its time for a change

8777367 as australias largest home loan provider it makes good strategic sense to look at alternative investments in this industry that will continue to bring benefits to shareholders and consumers mr norris said
8777368 the australian mortgage and housing industries are the backbone of the economy and the purchase of a home remains the largest single investment made by many consumers
8777369 as this market continues to develop a strategic investment in one of the market leading providers in this industry is a natural fit for the group he added

8777371 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents said mr walsh
8777372 it was evident that one passenger oxygen cylinder had sustained a sudden failure and forceful discharge of its pressurised contents into the aircraft hold rupturing the fuselage in the vicinity of the wing fuselage leading edge fairing
8777373 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering the cabin adjacent to the second main cabin door
8777374 the cylinder had subsequently impacted the door frame door handle and overhead panelling before falling to the cabin floor and exiting the aircraft through the ruptured fuselage
8777375 while some of the fuselage skin had folded outward and away from the rupture it was evident that an area of skin and structure equal to approximately one half of the total ruptured area had separated from the aircraft and was not recovered
8777376 on the basis of measurements taken around the ruptured areas the total area of the skin rupture was estimated at around 1 74 sq m
8777377 several small pieces of structural honeycomb material of the type comprising the wing leading edge fairing were found trapped around the edges of panels within the left side of the number 3 engine pylon
8777378 a small indentation and cut was found within the number 3 engine intake acoustic panelling located immediately inside the plane of rotation of the engine fan
8777379 as the failed cylinder was not recovered the atsb is currently working with the aircraft manufacturer other aircraft operators and the oxygen cylinder manufacturer to obtain samples of cylinders from the same manufacturing batch as the failed item to facilitate the ongoing investigation of all relevant issues
8777380 the implication of a possible mechanism or condition that could affect the structural integrity and safety of other oxygen cylinders used in the aviation environment
8777381 it is evident that the no 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8777382 its not that john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8777383 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8777384 stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8777385 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8777386 whom to root for pawlenty or romney i know that romney can be easily mocked but he seems more crisp on the attack would be nice to avoid that and go with the nothingburger pawlenty plus if romeny gets passed over rove and k lo will be heartbroken and halperins sources would have been wrong honestly im torn
8777387 i won a grand slam and i was playing really well obviously at the moment if you ask me if i am playing like no 1 then i would say probably not
8777388 it was my first time on such a big court
8777389 before the match i had hoped to play on the smaller court
8777390 this was a very disappointing loss for me but its something that i accept you know especially with everything that has happened in the last month or two
8777391 i couldnt expect myself to you know maybe even play better
8777392 she made a lot of errors especially with her forehand
8777393 and she didnt move very well i think maybe she was nervous more than i was
8777394 i was wondering if i was made to play tennis
8777395 i thought maybe i would end it at the end of the year i was wondering if i would ever make it into the top 100 because its not worth to play tennis
8777396 what has it done or failed to do that fills you with dismay what is laudable what is ludicrous
8777397 i realize im not the typical candidate for this office
8777398 what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes positions for political reasons because one thing we need to change about american politics is this idea that people cannot disagree without questioning each others motives or their patriotism
8777399 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8777400 on november 4th we must stand up and say 8 is enough
8777401 to the love of my life the next first lady michelle obama
8777402 i though id be pretty old if i saw it at all
8777403 i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8777404 you need a president that puts barney smith before smith barney
8777405 was known as a clear thinker and a great orator
8777406 purists are not going to like this and not everyone is going to like it
8777407 we are going to do our best to do it quickly and accurately
8777408 that is how many weve had so far and it will vary from year to year
8777409 when we come back with a ruling from video replay there is no argument unless it involves spectator interference and then the manager is entitled to an explanation
8777410 were only talking about home runs balls were not talking about plays at third base or balls and strikes or any of those things were just talking about a select portion of the game
8777411 sometimes with the configurations of these ballparks and so forth it makes it tough

8777413 the launch was meant to be in london but i said no
8777414 i said please can i go to manchester instead i love manchester its got a really good feel to it so i thought why not i usually spend a lot of time in london im really excited about coming back because of course its where i met david manchesters just so fashion conscious and theres great shopping
8777415 i have a lot of respect for paris hilton shes ballsy shes learned to play with the paparazzi attention and have fun with it and she creates little mysteries in the tabloid arena i have fun with her but its always been platonic our relationship wasnt sexual though i understand that sex sells
8777416 she and i have a very open communication were friends with common interests if you want to know the whole story youve got to be my friend its easy to put those labels on people but theyre not accurate were young in hollywood having fun
8777417 not only is mark shauers energy plan in direct conflict with voters who want congress to take immediate action to drill for more american oil its in direct conflict with energy experts who call the plan devastating
8777418 schauers proposal like legislation introduced by his democrat friends in washington is a sham that will accomplish nothing for michigan voters who suffer the wrath of high gas prices every day
8777419 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8777420 eight years in his state legislature in springfield illinois and one term in congress
8777421 i am much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
8777422 probably was shaped more by his fathers absence than his presence
8777423 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8777424 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8777425 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8777426 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8777427 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100m americans its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8777428 born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8777429 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8777430 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8777431 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8777432 but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes

8777437 i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8777438 i will cut taxes for 95 of all working families

8777440 when i look in the face of a woman wearing a mumu i think of my grandmother who was passed over for more attractive and better looking typical white women
8777441 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone to run from
8777442 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision
8777443 what prosecutors oftentimes want is an admission on the part of the public official and resignation
8777444 its a significant bargaining chip that he has if hes already removed from office then that certainly could have a possible impact on the plea negotiations
8777445 if he wants to leave the criminal cases he is going to need to do it before the removal is resolved
8777446 or you take your chances by going through the removal proceedings you fight that fight and see what happens
8777447 there are public officials who survive these trials and continue in office
8777448 there also are public officials who fight their cases get convicted and serve more time in jail than they would have if they had pleaded guilty or resigned
8777449 the governor is the sole tribunal in removal proceedings with no right of appeal or review afforded the accused
8777450 if the governor acts within the law the governors decision is final

8777452 microsoft let apple have the podium and dominate the communication space
8777453 its not how you would do things in politics where its tit for tat so it was time for microsoft to strike back
8777454 microsoft doesnt like being cast as a stodgy oldster by apples advertising and has turned to jerry seinfeld oh so they want to be cast as late middle age almost stodgy oldster
8777455 who is microsoft really trying to target if it is the thirty and fortysomething business community i think hes a great choice
8777456 is to woo the college age and younger crowd to convince them not to switch to a mac or to switch back
8777457 if youre 20 years old now and the show ended in 1998 when you were 10 thats going to seem a long time ago

8777459 if you want to make vista a cool operating system give it some cool i dont think jerry seinfeld does anything thats cool

8777464 were not going to make a huge jump but well definitely be heading in the right direction im really looking forward to the belgian grand prix because spa is an amazing race track it will be difficult to score points there but you can never predict what will happen somewhere like spa so well have to wait and see
8777465 im here to present an exciting project not only for the city as a whole but the fire department in particular
8777466 were not giving away money were here helping people to get the technology and equipment they need to do better business
8777467 better business means more jobs more money in the community and working for terrorists to feed families no longer being an alternative
8777468 they the iraqi government would like their money to be spent on schools clinics road repair sewage repair and items like that
8777469 we take that and apply that money to those major areas and then we look at the peripheral areas that dont necessarily fit this plan for example local businesses and we apply microgrants to those areas

8777491 the diaper obviously lessened the impact of the fall and saved the babys life

8777493 recent quarterly economic forecasts from the bank of england british chambers of commerce and oxford economics suggest that the uks economic prospects have worsened significantly over the past few months
8777494 the labour market is expected to loosen as a result of this which in turn is likely to reduce the level of pressure on wage demands
8777495 to what extent unemployment increases and inflation falls between now and the autumn will be key to the level of pay awards we see at the start of the major bargaining activity in january 2009
8777496 when inflation begins eating into workers wages it is all the more important to set our sights on settlements that will protect living standards not least when we know that the cost of many essentials is way ahead of the official inflation rate
8777497 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8777498 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000

8777510 caring matters deeply to individuals families and society in general
8777511 sustaining the ability of carers to provide the care and support they give to others is of critical importance
8777512 the current system is enormously complicated and even department for work and pensions staff struggle to correctly identify and clearly explain the benefits that carers and their families are entitled to
8777513 it is crucial that the government takes action to boost carers incomes as a matter of urgency
8777514 the two tier benefit recommended by the committee would be a major improvement to the current system
8777515 carers need a separate benefit which recognises that they are not unemployed but are making an important contribution to society
8777516 we are working with employers to ensure that carers can have a better balance between their work and caring responsibilities
8777517 the government is committed to reviewing the care and support system as part of the longer term welfare reform programme
8777518 we welcome this report which is a valuable contribution to the debate we will study the recommendations and respond to them in due course

8777523 for a lot of working parents its not a choice to leave their children at home alone they are working because they need the money to pay the mortgage and feed the family

8777525 its purely about keeping my heart rate up and burning calories
8777526 we believe the live element is going to be even more important going forward

8777539 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents julian walsh acting atsb executive director said today
8777540 it was evident that one passenger oxygen cylinder had sustained a sudden failure and forceful discharge of its pressurised contents into the aircraft hold rupturing the fuselage in the vicinity of the wing fuselage leading edge fairing
8777541 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering the cabin adjacent to the second main cabin door
8777542 the cylinder had subsequently impacted the door frame door handle and overhead panelling before falling to the cabin floor and exiting the aircraft through the ruptured fuselage

8777559 my computer has recently started crashing on me after roughly 20 minutes in any game ive had this rig for over three months and have gamed a lot on it prior to the recent crashing issues and ive run numerous tests on the memory and power supply and they both check out so im thinking its heat related it has been quite warm where i live lately and these crashes have coincided with the warmest of the weather not to mention i have been able to game for longer periods of time by cranking the a c all the way putting the computer closer live in an apartment with just a window mounted a c to the a c itself and turning all the fans to high this of course is a pain but is all evidence towards the problem being heat so with that in mind how do i cool my system down
8777560 i agree with your assessment of the situation may i suggest that you explore purchasing a chipset cooler rather than another rather mundane heatsink
8777561 i just got a new 70mm case fan and its got a problem it wont spin when hoo ked up to my mobos fan power plug its a 3 pin and the mobos a 4 pin connector no problem the old fan was a 3 pin as well and still works grinding bearings so i know the positioning and mobo are fine the new fan has a 3 pin connection and an extension to a 2 pin molex connector the fan works fine driven by the molex so wtf i pulled the pin catchers from the fans plastic adapter and cant see and visible faults in the wire or connections but its almost impossible to tell anyway i reversed the hot and ground leads in case they were installed backwards and nothing
8777562 most likely you have a pwm 4 pin connection on the motherboard often controlled by temperature and that is not giving enough starting voltage to make the fan spin
8777563 you could also buy a fan controller for your computer then you could control how fast your fans are running if you go that route i would suggest the following
8777564 has anyone ever told you youre like martha stewart on steroids or crack
8777565 yes way says right here reads a couple lines from the news article wow what a surprise hes married to tea leoni

8777574 is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8777575 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8777576 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8777577 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8777578 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8777579 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8777580 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8777581 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8777582 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome
8777583 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8777584 we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8777585 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
8777586 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8777587 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8777588 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
8777589 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8777590 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8777591 we believe that into the period of 2009 youll start to see economic growth picking up he told fairfax radio
8777592 if you go with the forecasts which were released by the reserve bank in august you see growth by the june quarter 2009 improving to two and a quarter and then by the end of next year to two and a half he said
8777593 id much rather be up front about that with the australian people rather than pretending that its any different
8777594 its a big challenge and its been a big challenge frankly since day one
8777595 australia is not immune to whats going on around the world the key thing is what youre doing about it and our plan in response to that is to first of all make sure that we dont put further upwards pressure on inflation interest rates thats our 22 billion surplus
8777596 secondly to make sure were investing in the countrys long term productivity growth thats what were talking about with the eduction revolution
8777597 thats the third part of our economic strategy for the future but its going to be tough i dont want to mislead people
8777598 really difficult time for australians which was why the government was focused on creating a budget position to enable the reserve bank to cut interest rates

8777600 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents said mr walsh
8777601 it was evident that one passenger oxygen cylinder had sustained a sudden failure and forceful discharge of its pressurised contents into the aircraft hold rupturing the fuselage in the vicinity of the wing fuselage leading edge fairing
8777602 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering the cabin adjacent to the second main cabin door
8777603 the cylinder had subsequently impacted the door frame door handle and overhead panelling before falling to the cabin floor and exiting the aircraft through the ruptured fuselage
8777604 while some of the fuselage skin had folded outward and away from the rupture it was evident that an area of skin and structure equal to approximately one half of the total ruptured area had separated from the aircraft and was not recovered
8777605 on the basis of measurements taken around the ruptured areas the total area of the skin rupture was estimated at around 1 74 sq m
8777606 several small pieces of structural honeycomb material of the type comprising the wing leading edge fairing were found trapped around the edges of panels within the left side of the number 3 engine pylon
8777607 a small indentation and cut was found within the number 3 engine intake acoustic panelling located immediately inside the plane of rotation of the engine fan
8777608 as the failed cylinder was not recovered the atsb is currently working with the aircraft manufacturer other aircraft operators and the oxygen cylinder manufacturer to obtain samples of cylinders from the same manufacturing batch as the failed item to facilitate the ongoing investigation of all relevant issues
8777609 the implication of a possible mechanism or condition that could affect the structural integrity and safety of other oxygen cylinders used in the aviation environment

8777626 which means he is saying im in great pain and great sorrow
8777627 and i think as believers in a free nation like this we need to be asking the lord to give us a burden to understand the pain and suffering of multitudes of christians our brothers and sisters and to pray for them perhaps to take a day of the week to fast and pray for them
8777628 any time somebody says that they committed a murder we are going to take that seriously

8777633 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation
8777634 i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8777635 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against and the taliban in afghanistan
8777636 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons

8777646 dislocation in global credit markets associated volatility in equity markets and a downturn in asset markets significantly impact allcos operations financial position and outlook
8777647 loss of confidence in allco resulted in a dramatic fall in share price
8777648 this new business model means allco will be a fiduciary manager of investment funds in aviation shipping and private equity
8777649 we will cease our principal investment activities sell remaining non core assets and in the future only use the balance sheet to co invest in our managed funds
8777650 the reconstruction of the group is progressing however the business remains in a fragile position and the continued market weakness is making the task difficult
8777651 this new structure is a major departure from our previous operations in which the group was heavily reliant on debt and as a result was exposed to the global credit crisis and deteriorating financial markets
8777652 we have got a problem now with the company it is being run by people who dont have ink in their veins
8777653 and this latest act is basically bowing to the market and saying weve got a market downturn here and what do we do we reach for the knife
8777654 this is really a pretty brutal way of doing it

8777668 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8777669 my grandmother helped raised me and one day just before she died she told me baby someday the lowest rung is going to be on top

8777680 police in denver arrested an abc news producer today as he and a camera crew were attempting to take pictures on a public sidewalk of democratic senators and vip donors leaving a private meeting at the brown palace hotel
8777681 perhaps most troubling has been the involvement of government security agencies in trying to repress those protesting and reporting on the corruption during a walk through downtown at lunch today the police were as they have been all week patrolling the street in full riot gear

8777688 some important uncertainties regarding health risks from very old or worn fields containing high concentrations of lead
8777689 we indicate that these are interim recommendations because probably more data will be coming from either the commission or the environmental protection agency or other agencies that may be doing testing
8777690 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8777691 supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet
8777692 we have a shot at establishing ourselves as the quality alternative for a more discerning older audience
8777693 for me its ultimately the order of the cosmos or what i describe as the creation
8777694 you cant simply have in my own judgment creation simply being a random event because it is so inherently ordered and the fact that the natural environment is being ordered where it can properly coexist over time
8777695 if you were simply reducing that to mathematically probabilities ive got to say it probably wouldnt have happened
8777696 so i think there is an intelligent mind at work
8777697 well if we do x and then y will happen to the economy
8777698 well i dont believe that i think itll just work because god wants it to
8777699 god created the big bang and the laws of physics

8777752 ahhnold has taken a break from action movies for quite some time spurring much anticipation of his return to brutality my friends at kupd have sped up this process with their support for ahhnold s band austrian death machine every morning now ahhnold will one up everyones expectation and return more brutal than ever combining thrash metal with action inducing live fury for the kupd end of summer scorcher im just excited the governator let me be a part of all this
8777753 a tribute to the great arnold former actor and current california governor arnold schwarzenegger movies it is a band fronted by ahhnold with music i wrote and recorded in my free time but most importantly i had so much fun
8777754 whenever a new band comes out i often hear it said thats exactly what youd expect from a heavy band i beg to differ
8777755 and yes i would never leave out the obvious key component clich vocals that sound really angry none of this scary screaming with makeup or goofy lows that we can all make under our breath
8777756 more vicious and agressive than ever before redefining brutality and combining the best elements of metal and hardcore to a perfect war machine crushing everything on its path bands like full blown chaos sworn enemy hatebreed cataract and hatesphere come to mind but yet bloodshot experiences no difficulties in creating their own distinctive sound giving them an original touch in the metalcore scene nowadays

8777776 stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war

8777778 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream

8777780 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8777781 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8777782 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8777783 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8777784 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8777785 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8777786 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8777787 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8777788 i feel like hes inspiring me because people used to tell me that black man cant do it
8777789 now look at barack hes going for president that tells me that i can do anything
8777790 it make me feel like i can do something with my life

8777793 i cannot wait until tonight to listen to obama speak thats because he has a chance of being the president of the united states
8777794 barack obama may not be the only president maybe well have a president in this room as well
8777795 these are difficult decisions to make difficult decisions that we dont want to make
8777796 that being said weve spent the last two months working with agencies to ensure that theyre going to maintain their core services
8777797 the governors actions will put abused and neglected children at greater risk reduce access to medicaid and food stamps and further harm state parks and historic sites
8777798 were continuing to work with the agencies on management plans for further savings
8777799 its going to be devastating to local communities that depend on these sites for tourist revenue
8777800 the other 300 parks natural areas wildlife areas will remain unaffected

8777807 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8777808 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8777809 need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8777810 john mccains campaign has informed us that they will not be releasing the name of his vp candidate tonight
8777811 it sure makes me not judge people as guilty until i hear everything
8777812 its easy to judge people just because they are here
8777813 its very ironic and thats what everybodys kidding me about saying havent you had enough of this place
8777814 people who go to lakewood are screwballs and nuts we try our hardest not to put anybody who goes to lakewood regularly on any jury
8777815 its a classic case of a he said she said but everything that happened between them was enthusiastically consensual
8777816 after a very difficult 17 months i feel like i have finally been validated i have listened and read with horror as judge kents lawyer suggested that what happened to me was enthusiastically consensual i am relieved to find that even federal judges are not above the law and that sexual abuse in the workplace is never acceptable no matter the status of the offender when i heard the outcome of my complaint to the 5th circuit judicial council i was shocked that judge kents conduct was not viewed more seriously and that he would be allowed to continue to sit in judgment of others i read what happened to me referred to as sexual harassment the indictment makes clear that the department of justice and the grand jury recognize that what happened to me was much more than offensive words i no longer have to worry that my complaint had fallen on deaf ears it has been heard has not been ignored by the criminal justice system and i am both relieved and thankful i am now satisfied to let this matter now be resolved by the very court system that i have faithfully enjoyed serving for the past eight years
8777817 im curious how the uploaded cc file is formatted to synchronize with the video
8777818 costa rica president arias asks dalai lama to postpone visit
8777819 it is unfortunate that such an issue is decided by a small group of technicians this decision is not purely technical it has extremely serious and extensive socio cultural impact society should be heard this is a topic of digital citizenship the right of fair use and to save images the way people want
8777820 the election air time on tv is a balm to comfort those citizens who imagined that their past elected governments had not done any work for the past 4 years in a few minutes the mistake is clarified and with surprise we find out that we had misunderstood and things are happening at a hallucinating pace with a little help from computer graphics its possible to create a parallel administration
8777821 what people on the street wanted to see was revenue growth and a solid gross margin number
8777822 because if you sell things for no profit to some extent whats the point this indicates that they might have to streamline even more now
8777823 going forward the answer is better pricing and better execution and better footprints on newer products if youve been reading the news the last few days youve seen a large number of products last week and this week and youll see that continue
8777824 i agree with the american automobile association we should all inflate our tires
8777825 he told me that there was a lot of gossip around the city gym that mr rivkin and gordon were he used the term faggots
8777826 he had quite strong feelings for your daughter didnt he
8777827 its a period of my life thats indelibly etched on my mind and i will never forget
8777828 in the same way you are trying to minimise your daughters problems with depression as well arent you
8777829 you are even trying to minimise the fact that she tried to take her own life in 1992
8777830 the new ceo chief executive manager may from time to time put his or her head in the door of our hcc meetings where as the situation now is that we have our district manager patti hudson who attends all the meetings both for bundaberg and the north burnett
8777831 i had a conversation with senator obama last week and we talked in part about where hed come from and where hes headed to
8777832 it receiving the nomination is an extraordinary achievement for him as an individual american politician
8777833 i am getting a bit frustrated with the liberal party in the senate
8777834 that has one consequence less money for the budget to spend on proper purposes and secondly it has the effect of putting further upward pressure on rates
8777835 this is a gutless cowardly way of telling people that theyre not going to have their health facility in a fully operational and full functional capacity
8777836 but we have got to not lay down on this i can assure the people of aramac and the surrounding district until theres blood on the floor i will not be letting up
8777837 there is no decision that has been taken to close the aramac hospital
8777838 the plea of guilty must attract a significant discounted penalty
8777839 she comes before the court as a significant figure in this state with a significant list of achievements
8777840 she regrets profoundly for having a low range bac blood alcohol concentration
8777841 but she is confident that this is a one off occurrence and it will not re occur
8777842 scott seamers a perfect example he won the melbourne cup on ethereal and now hes still punching around horses in queensland without really getting rides in big carnivals
8777843 so one year hes the toast of the town and the next year no one wants to know him and thats essentially the way racing is
8777844 we need to have some funds to start them off and thats what were asking for
8777845 weve been asking for the industry for a while and its come down to actually asking out of prize money because every industry racing body government body weve spoken to is very supportive but no one wants to come up with the cold hard funds to kick off this sort of scenario
8777846 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering cabin adjacent to the second main cabin doors
8777847 the cylinders been propelled up with significant force to do the damage that it has and its happened very quickly so it probably would have been a matter of seconds
8777848 these oxygen bottles are actually quite robust so it would take some significant force to do some damage like that
8777849 theres nothing at this stage that the atsb can identify that could have been done to prevent this we dont really know why the bottle failed thats the key question for the investigation
8777850 anythings possible its certainly a rare event but no one can discount the possibility of those sort of things happening
8777851 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8777852 it is clear that young people want to make a difference the emphasis for this is reinforced by other findings
8777853 the review finds that for young people theres been a generational shift in australian politics its no longer about political loyalties its about political choice
8777854 im no soothsayer but clearly the internet is having an increasingly significant role to play
8777855 it allows for far more voices to directly enter the public sphere
8777856 there is a wide range of views online covering all political persuasions
8777857 the low cost of online publishing allows smaller groups parties to compete with larger and better resourced organisations
8777858 personally im always ready to learn although i dont always like being taught
8777859 personally im always ready to learn although i dont always like being taught
8777860 im really proud of the fact that weve really raised the level of our intensity despite only having 12 000 people in the stands
8777861 theyve been very professional about this thats the part i really appreciate about it also youd like to see 36 000 every night but for right now the way our guys are going about our business im very proud of them
8777862 while my earlier action to have the citys judgment claims fund pay this fine is legally defensible
8777863 it is clear that it is not politically acceptable and creates the appearance that i somehow feel that the citys ethics sanctions do not apply to me
8777864 that is not the case and not the impression that i want to give to the citizens of seattle
8777865 its my understanding the council is eager to close that loophole and we will provide whatever advice we can to support that
8777866 my position has been that if i showed no actual impairment what am i guilty of
8777867 however ive lost that battle and i concede that fact
8777868 has now established a nebulous or undefined precedent which troubles me i fear that the current standard is so vague that no one knows to which standard they are to be held accountable
8777869 bad guys you better watch out because there is a new sheriff in town a black sheriff and if you saw blazing saddles you know you are in for a world of pain you can pee on our rug but you can expect a response
8777870 john if youre still awake hear me good old man you better just stay home and watch wheel of fortune and put a reverse mortgage on your seven homes and live comfortably because i am gonna win this election so help me god and by god i mean the dude in the holy bible and not anywhere else like say the koran which i have never read and had never heard of until i ran for president true that oh its a religion you say well im sorry im a christian in case you didnt know peace out
8777871 reformulates its approach to your golfers skills and gear with dramatically improved results
8777872 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8777873 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8777874 the campaign is all about mixing the old with the new
8777875 the bottom line is instead of stranger contacting you about barack obama we want to give people the tools to go to their neighbors go to people who know them and spread the message
8777876 if you look at the data on how many people are voting and whos voting even in the midterm elections in 2002 2006 you see higher rates of voting than truly a decade ago
8777877 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8777878 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8777879 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8777880 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8777881 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8777882 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8777883 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8777884 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8777885 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8777886 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8777887 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8777888 in my experience these are some of the most unusual circumstances surrounding a missing person
8777889 forget about her being an olympic athlete forget about the job she is just an absolutely incredible person a great individual
8777890 i worked so hard for so long ive been training since i was like 7 for this
8777891 believe in yourself and go the extra mile because it will pay off in the long run
8777892 personally im always ready to learn although i dont always like being taught
8777893 if you are from the other side its almost like youre afraid to say a whole lot about it
8777894 you dont have much of a chance of changing minds when theres so many of the other side and theyre so passionate about their candidates and about their issues
8777895 its a futile attempt its a lot of emotion right now
8777896 trying to order tents in this city has been almost impossible
8777897 she made a lot of errors so i got a lot of free points
8777898 i thought maybe she was nervous more than i was
8777899 today i felt nervous at the beginning then it went away
8777900 i was just playing on the court in a normal match for me at match point it the nerves came back to win the last point a lot of pressure came back
8777901 i think i just had a lot more power than she did today
8777902 she plays a game where she hits a lot of high balls which at my height doesnt you know i think it would be effective against a lot of players but with my height and my reach it doesnt phase me as much i think that helped me
8777903 i was nervous going onto the court because i never saw her play before so i didnt know what to expect
8777904 i thought i can slowly get into the match and she played completely different than i expected she was serving extremely well and hitting very powerful shots
8777905 i really struggled and made too many unforced errors and my serve was not working really well
8777906 william showed what a great player he is against fc twente
8777907 everyone has bad times last season at birmingham i made a big mistake by conceding the injury time penalty that led to the equaliser that was my thing
8777908 william is a big player a more experienced player and he is the captain so when people look for someone to blame unfortunately it is him but the players dont think that is right we dont blame him for everything everyone makes mistakes i made a mistake like i said at birmingham everyone is behind william and it will remain like this
8777909 the big thing is to feel that you are wanted by your club manager teammates and the fans
8777910 it was a big disappointment for the fans to see what happened during the summer but ade is a big big player last year he showed he has the quality to be one of the best in europe so we just have to be behind him i am sure if he starts scoring goals and in december he is on 15 20 goals everything will be fine
8777911 we have to win things that is the main objective to win something this year
8777912 if we can win things the way we play it would be even better because football is about entertaining people and taking pleasure and thats what we are doing at arsenal i hope that this year will be a good one for us i am sure we can do it
8777913 the fc twente game was about bouncing back from the defeat at fulham on saturday that was not good enough it was a big blow for us but we learned from it and it wont happen again
8777914 hei t es in einer bamberger anwaltskanzlei die mit studienplatzklagen gutes geld verdient
8777915 wer jemals in irgendeiner weise kommunal politisch engagiert war wei freilich dass sich dies praktisch kaum umsetzen lie e weil sich nahezu t glich situationen ergeben bei denen die nichtannahme des angedienten als etiketteverletzende br skierung aufgefasst w rde
8777916 this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8777917 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8777918 oh we really wanted to add a couple of women to the list but didnt
8777919 he gives a great teleprompter speech but when the teleprompter gets turned off hes not so hot
8777920 i think its fair to say the country is behind on infrastructure i think everybody recognizes that on both sides of the aisle
8777921 this is senator mccains decision and his announcement and we all want to be respectful of his desire to have the chance to announce it himself
8777922 estamos juntos en uno de esos momentos definitorios un momento cuando nuestra naci n est en guerra nuestra econom a est en problemas y la promesa americana ha sido amenazada una vez m s
8777923 oh yeah i remember when my brother beat that guy for the first time
8777924 eminem steppin onto the scene x fattest skinny kid alive
8777925 my goal at this point was that we would be a unified and energized party
8777926 they put aside any question of whether they were supporters of sen obama
8777927 it was the most moving moment of my 32 years in the labor movement he said
8777928 i think we in miami county can get obama if not over the top at 51 percent at least in the real high 40s
8777929 perd n perd n en nombre de la naci n paraguaya por tantas injusticias a las que fueron sometidos
8777930 es un claro llamado simb lico luego de 61 a os de hegemon a del partido de estado que durante m s de 35 a os gobern bajo un r gimen dictatorial
8777931 al mismo tiempo que el presidente lugo ped a perd n solicit al poder judicial que encare el desaf o para investigar en el mbito jurisdiccional estas violaciones determinar las responsabilidades juzgar y eventualmente punir
8777932 el poder judicial est indudablemente atrasado con respecto a llegar a la verdad jur dica de lo ocurrido
8777933 mi opini n es que a n a veinte a os de transici n sigue teniendo en sus filas a ex jerarcas del r gimen stronista
8777934 el parlamento como el ejecutivo tienen todas las prerrogativas constitucionales para urgir las investigaciones incluso cuentan con una figura para llevar a juicio pol tico a miembros de la corte que as no lo hicieren
8777935 el mantener el tema de la inmigraci n en el epicentro del di logo pol tico
8777936 yo estoy aqu para ver un proceso hist rico y para apoyar al movimiento inmigrante
8777937 yo creo que las personas a las cuales hist ricamente les pertenec an estas tierras deber an tener acceso a todos los derechos de esta sociedad
8777938 obama ha prometido que firmar una reforma migratoria cuando sea aprobada por el congreso entonces necesitamos elegir a m s dem cratas al senado y la c mara de representantes para que la reforma salga en el 2009
8777939 i said weve got a big party planned for you
8777940 we did not ask him for that we think thats for him to tell when hes ready to divulge that information
8777941 someone who rounds out someone thats with him ideology wise
8777942 at first it was a little sober but once you get into it its pretty cool youre meeting people from places all across the country
8777943 la soberan a como ustedes saben no es una noci n abstracta ella representa una fuente de autoridad y protecci n
8777944 canad asume su responsabilidad por la protecci n ambiental y la seguridad en nuestras aguas rticas

8777946 im really proud of the fact that weve really raised the level of our intensity despite only having 12 000 people in the stands
8777947 the thing we learned from this summer was we dont know a thing
8777948 the lesson was you dont need guys to make money on a movie
8777949 you can make movies that are a little nichier and still do remarkably well
8777950 it looked like a video game in the tv commercials a blitz of colors and not much else
8777951 you really had to see the movie to get it unfortunately not that many people did
8777952 was it a sex comedy was it a sports comedy it had a very confused marketing campaign
8777953 x files proves just because something was on tv once doesnt mean it makes sense as a movie
8777954 nobody can limit the use of knowledge anywhere in the world
8777955 nigeria is never entering into any agreement with iran for any matter that has to do with weapons
8777956 there shouldnt be a misunderstanding between exploration or uses of energy to provide power and the uses of energy for weapons so that our relationship with iran will not be misconstrued by nigerians and the entire international community
8777957 im not generally an alarmist but i am really really concerned about this country
8777958 starting in 1998 there was such a shift in silicon valley toward chasing money and short term returns
8777959 in some ways we have the problem that it looks like innovation is flourishing but too much of it is short term incremental innovation
8777960 what venture capitalists should do is start taking more risks again
8777961 taking risks and failing is one of the most critical aspects of innovation
8777962 this string of indictments strikes a serious blow to major methamphetamine trafficking in the sacramento region and beyond
8777963 this operation was an excellent example of how the use of narcotics task forces and inter agency cooperation can be an effective tool in taking down major drug rings
8777964 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8777965 it opens the road for all of latin america to start visualizing legal paths to abortion
8777966 this tragedy we are living in mexico city is going to spread to other states
8777967 this decision was in regard to mexico citys legislative assembly but in the end it establishes a precedent that can be applied to other local lawmaking bodies
8777968 its not up to the supreme court to legalize or criminalize abortion
8777969 they are just encouraging women to be dirty and loose
8777970 the justices decision is only going to spread more irresponsible behavior
8777971 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8777972 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8777973 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8777974 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8777975 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8777976 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve experienced in the history of humankind
8777977 not only in the heat of this election but in the aftermath as we put his agenda to work for our country
8777978 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8777979 the united states is now more dependent on foreign oil than it ever was
8777980 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8777981 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8777982 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8777983 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight on nov
8777984 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8777985 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8777986 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8777987 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8777988 season ticket sales have continued to climb the last couple of years
8777989 our season ticket numbers are very strong and tops in the atlantic coast conference this is a great testimony to the loyalty of our iptay donors and they should be proud of the message this sends
8777990 he raced at a time when racing was extremely dangerous and got through it all without a serious injury
8777991 he had an extraordinary mechanical sense he was very much in tune with the car
8777992 i as well as all employees of ferrari are extremely saddened by the news of the passing of phil hill a man and a champion who gave so much to ferrari
8777993 phil and i have always kept in touch throughout the years and i know i will miss his passion and love for ferrari very much
8777994 and he knew it off the top of his head he was extremely intelligent and well rounded he was an opera expert and very well read he was very sophisticated
8777995 phil was a very special guy and had a love for the automotive age
8777996 he was always a potential winner when he sat in a race car he was both a competitor and a close friend and a fellow i could look up to
8777997 the o bomb america is on suicide watch in baracks america
8777998 wants to impose wide ranging even draconian restrictions on former diplomats to prevent them from discussing anything that draws on their experience in the diplomatic service
8777999 freedom of information means it is not up to the government to decide what information is made public and what stays private
8778000 if you are asking if im playing like a number one no
8778001 tiger woods is my best man no im kidding that would be cool eh
8778002 i think its easy to come up with headlines in newspapers i think ive seen almost every one of those like when i lose you know the filleted fish kind of thing fried fish its easy when i lose because you throw one of those two out there i tend to see those a lot
8778003 whats done is done ive moved past it and you know whatever gets him to sleep at night is fine if he says after three hours he cant feel a ball hitting his racquet then apparently every fifth set hes ever played he cant feel the ball
8778004 you know to say that he didnt feel it hit his racquet is kind of a crock
8778005 i would say more my tennis coach had to spend time with me because i think my brother would not have so much patience
8778006 i think he was heckling llodra i think he said something like go back to france you know the queens supporting you or something i dont know i dont think he was heckling me i think it was more towards him
8778007 i think every time i lose is because of me not because of the other person so i think thats pretty much dominance
8778008 to be honest i didnt know that that was the date
8778009 trabzon de irmenderespor ile b yle birlikteli i daha uygun g rd k yap lan transferler nedeniyle bir ara tak m ihtiyac vard paf ve a tak m aras ndaki zinciri tamamlamak i in de bu uygulama gerekliydi
8778010 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8778011 all i know is that park chu young attended training today and there is a big chance that he will play at the weekend
8778012 lets not talk about what may happen and talk about what is happening there are other players who want to move abroad not just park
8778013 but now im ready and it was only two games i missed so i will look forward to it and im ready
8778014 i really feel good its always terrible to get injuries youre all alone you know you see the boys just running around and you just sit there on the sideline but now im back and im really one hundred percent
8778015 i would say the league is higher than what i thought what we heard from europe you didnt hear that much about the a league to be honest
8778016 but i think the league is pretty good and is going up you can see it so i really look forward to playing here
8778017 were still waiting for his international clearance to come through from italy
8778018 im not sure on the timescale on that but hopefully well get it done so he can travel with us on friday afternoon fingers crossed
8778019 hell certainly be coming as part of the squad but if we do get his clearance through hell definitely be involved somewhere down the line
8778020 from the under 17 australian teams all the way to the full national team
8778021 vince is a fantastic player more of a defensive midfielder and again i think he is going to bring something to this team and be a major asset for us
8778022 i looked at the fixtures and noticed straight away that west ham away was the third game in
8778023 the trip to upton park was the one that stood out to me for some reason i cant think why
8778024 not long ago i was looking at the fixtures and thinking about darlington and rochdale no disrespect to them
8778025 now here i am looking at when we are going to be playing against manchester united and chelsea and west ham of course
8778026 against portsmouth i think everyone sat up and took notice of that and wigan was one where we had to dig in a bit more against a very physical team who i think will cause a lot of problems for teams at home this year
8778027 i think its important to take a lot from both games not every game in the premier league is easy to play great flowing football in
8778028 against portsmouth he scored a great goal and then the free kick he hit the other day at wigan was a match winning moment its what you want players like him in your team for i expect more of the same from him
8778029 you can never say that you are a first choice at this football club
8778030 if you start to think like that then you can just about guarantee that you are about to lose your place
8778031 its a big fight to get into the team its a bigger fight to stay there
8778032 of course we have to win things that is the main objective to win something this year
8778033 but if we can do it the way we play it is even better because football is to entertain people and to take pleasure and thats what we are doing at arsenal
8778034 fulham showed us last weekend that you have to be up for every game game after game because english football is so different than many other football in europe
8778035 that was a big blow and we learn from this and hopefully it wont happen again
8778036 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8778037 we are working quite hard behind the scenes to get players in but you can only do your own bit as highlighted by the man united tottenham berbatov scenario
8778038 you can only do as much as you can then you need someone else to say yes
8778039 we have got bids on the table for a number of players and if players become available at the other end hopefully they will become hull city players eventually
8778040 but until that happens i will just continue to try to do the work as much as i can
8778041 we are trying to improve and the players know we are trying to improve their situation
8778042 we are trying to help the players who are at the football club they have got to see the players that are coming in are an improvement as opposed to a step back
8778043 i also like fiorentina but everyone will finish behind us inter are still the best
8778044 hes the most complete coach ive ever had on the pitch and off it
8778045 hes meticulous about every little detial with us and it seems also with journalists
8778046 i heard him talking when he was at chelsea and after one and a half months of knowing him ive only positive things to say
8778047 you can see straight away the difference to other coaches now theres a new spirit the team has more confidence in itself
8778048 were looking to do a lego batman series i think theyre looking at doing a one off initially
8778049 and theyre basically able to utilise the assets because our team has brought lego characters to life my understanding is that they will use the engine the maya files where the characters come to life but theyll be creating animated i think its a 20 minute cartoon im personally quite intrigued to see how it comes out lego every time theyve had a new brand out theyve done some cgi stuff as well but i think this will be quite different
8778050 its testimony of a co conspirator in furtherance of a conspiracy
8778051 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8778052 broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8778053 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8778054 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8778055 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8778056 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8778057 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8778058 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8778059 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8778060 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8778061 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8778062 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8778063 that youre not automatically expected to live in a suburban place where you drive everywhere
8778064 are good tax revenue generators they provide a lot of jobs
8778065 the intown market as a whole was doing very well and there definitely was pent up demand
8778066 i think everyone is really enjoying the benefits of being able to walk and bike to places not to have to get in your car to do the things we do day to day
8778067 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge
8778068 is an important indication that this particular outbreak is over
8778069 we continue to believe that association could reflect real contamination early on
8778070 it is information that is more restricted in time and does not have confirmatory laboratory findings behind it
8778071 the fate of the clayton county school system is now in the hands of the voters
8778072 i blame those board members who didnt put my needs before their own they all say they put the students first but they really just think about themselves and because of them my future is now at risk
8778073 i didnt work this hard for all these years to graduate with a worthless diploma
8778074 we cant stay in a school system thats not accredited sure it may get better but i dont know if we can afford to wait it out
8778075 ill do whatever it takes to make sure these kids get full accreditation
8778076 a storm came through and look at it now the sun is shining
8778077 today the students education in this particular district is being compromised
8778078 through the elections to replace these four board members they can send a clear signal that the kind of behavior that has led to this ruling and the systems loss of accreditation will not be tolerated
8778079 theres positive intent in some cases but there is no result in some cases
8778080 it not only violates standards for accreditation but board policy and violates state law
8778081 they gave the superintendent responsibility that needed to be held by the board
8778082 if folks continue to talk about the blame and try to do the autopsies a year from now well be in the exact same place
8778083 its about as bad a thing as could happen to a housing market
8778084 its already hard enough to sell a home here and now its about to get worse
8778085 now this is going to drive down all our property values and bring up foreclosures get ready for the mass exodus i was planning to put my kids in public school starting in middle school but now i dont want to be in this county anymore
8778086 something like that would happen really late on the bus
8778087 there are people who get on the bus intoxicated or on some type of narcotic just being a disturbance
8778088 they should have security because there are people who get out of hand on the bus
8778089 we want you to be aware and if you notice anything contact the driver to call police
8778090 it really depends on what route you go to because on some routes they still have a lot of disturbances
8778091 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
8778092 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
8778093 they cant recreate the reagan coalition life has changed americas priorities are different
8778094 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
8778095 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8778096 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8778097 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8778098 i suspect this crowd is going to be very surprised at how specific barack obama is going to be about his economic and social platform because much of it has been vague
8778099 much of what obama has been able to do so far has been carried forward by his charisma and his unique experience as the first african american nominated for president
8778100 everything ive learned in my eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8778101 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8778102 i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it and change it is exactly what barack obama will do
8778103 as oil companies post the biggest profits in history nearly half a trillion dollars in the last five years john wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks thats not change thats the same
8778104 who cares if he is black his race is irrelevant
8778105 if you are asking if im playing like a number one no
8778106 tiger woods is my best man no im kidding that would be cool eh
8778107 i think its easy to come up with headlines in newspapers i think ive seen almost every one of those like when i lose you know the filleted fish kind of thing fried fish its easy when i lose because you throw one of those two out there i tend to see those a lot
8778108 whats done is done ive moved past it and you know whatever gets him to sleep at night is fine if he says after three hours he cant feel a ball hitting his racquet then apparently every fifth set hes ever played he cant feel the ball
8778109 you know to say that he didnt feel it hit his racquet is kind of a crock
8778110 i would say more my tennis coach had to spend time with me because i think my brother would not have so much patience
8778111 i think he was heckling llodra i think he said something like go back to france you know the queens supporting you or something i dont know i dont think he was heckling me i think it was more towards him
8778112 i think every time i lose is because of me not because of the other person so i think thats pretty much dominance
8778113 to be honest i didnt know that that was the date
8778114 there is no solution for the palestinian question except through jihad initiatives propos als and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors
8778115 the situation that has developed in the gaza strip in recent months has led to egypt in practice having a border with iran
8778116 i think this will reinforce the image of obama as more of a celebrity than anything else
8778117 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross
8778118 im voting for obama i think his proposals to improve the country are more positive and im not a big war believer
8778119 i wouldnt vote for john mccain if he was a democrat i would not vote at all before id vote for him
8778120 with more than a dozen homes between them john mccain and mitt romney may know a little something about real estate but their economic proposals would be a disaster for america
8778121 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8778122 the taliban are growing bolder in their tactics and clearly doing their best to exploit security gaps where they exist

8778140 i was sitting on our porch in sedona and i saw an article about the folds of honor foundation
8778141 since bob and i both come from military families i knew we had to get involved
8778142 i know there are a lot of military families at briarwood
8778143 it would be nice if we got 500 to 1 000
8778144 we got involved this year at the last minute but we should be able to do even better for next year
8778145 people dont hack accounts by using programs and any other bullsh that you hear around xbox live
8778146 at the time i was still competing for uzbekistan they told me if i take german citizenship after three years everything will be free for alisher i think in my place every mother would do the same thing the child is first for me it doesnt matter if i ever compete in a world championships again i was only thinking about alisher
8778147 germany has done many great things for him we never thought that another country or another people would help you like this i now know that the world has more good people than bad people when we came to germany in one week he was already in the hospital and receiving treatment germany gave life to my son
8778148 i was swimming next to her and she beat me and she has one leg its incredible she was able to do that
8778149 nassar a 21 year old dentistry student is one of the few women from her region ever to swim in the olympics she did most of her training sporadically and without a coach in a 12 meter pool because she lacked a permit to reach the nearest olympic size pool in israel
8778150 shes dodged more than just tufts of grass on the crushed 1980s concrete that serves as her training ground threats checkpoints and very real bullets have been just three of the obstacles and with her trainer a sunni shes a shiite she has also sprinted improbably past three brutal years of sectarian killings one of only two iraqis to compete in track and field this summer hussein is proud and determined to represent iraq despite the odds still her dreams extend beyond the medals says hussein sports can unify the iraqi people no sunnis no shiites just sport for the country
8778151 she let out a satisfied scream after releasing the bar on her final lift an expression she said that was relief it was joy it was excitement it was the culmination of 14 years as a lifter and definitely eight years waiting to come back to the olympics definitely worth the wait
8778152 one of the many risks a spectator assumes while attending a baseball game is possible injury from foul balls

8778155 police in denver arrested an abc news producer today as he and a camera crew were attempting to take pictures on a public sidewalk of democratic senators and vip donors leaving a private meeting at the brown palace hotel
8778156 plotting how to pressure obama to fulfill his populist promises on issues like trade and corporate power and right next to us was a dinner party whereby the american ruling class feasted on the obama campaigns innards

8778197 six meat sometimes with extra cheese and spicy peppers got brew
8778198 preston the head chef at six meat buffet wants to put his meat in your mouth
8778199 right minded thinking basted in the tasty sauce of truth
8778200 im not sure if preston is trying to put out a humorous blog or not but his writings keep me laughing
8778201 tenderized boned and free from nasty by products i love six meat buffet
8778202 one day i was looking for food on the web and i found this craphole called six meat buffet
8778203 a man and his cleaver whacking away at lipoidal thinking everywhere
8778204 smb is like pork sausage bad for you ugly to watch being made but too damned tasty to resist
8778205 what i have learned from this site is that i now know where mouth breathers and knuckle draggers come to get their rocks off

8778210 in the past decade several police departments around the country have adopted programs using mobile video recording technology or video cameras mounted in their police cruisers
8778211 although the programs initially encountered some resistance as big brother oversight departments with successful programs report that video cameras have cut down on litigation and liability costs as well as improved relationships between officers and citizens during encounters
8778212 the cost of the hardware ranges from 3 900 to 6 300 per car for cameras that do not have wireless uploading capability
8778213 it catches law violations on film creates an objective record of encounters between officers and citizens and serves as an evidentiary tool in court for both criminal and civil cases
8778214 one of the chiefs priorities has been to implement technology for officers
8778215 so incrementally wed like to push for more of a presence of in car video surveillance as well
8778216 the major issue is obviously the budget these can be some expense but were exploring some grant funded opportunities for the cameras
8778217 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8778218 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8778219 im single and i had a long term girlfriend up until last november
8778220 i have been seen with more than one woman in the last few months so im an easy target for those kind of things
8778221 this is becoming more bizarre than even a classic washington story
8778222 its like a soap opera were looking at as washington turns here youve got politics big money and a much needed aircraft and possibly even more delays
8778223 it was adjoining property and i thought it was a good idea to try to preserve the historic significance of the house and the area
8778224 it was in terrible condition we had to do a lot of work to keep it from deteriorating further
8778225 you could hear the floor creak and squeak like boots or a heavy step
8778226 she came flying out the door and she was white as the house
8778227 the termites had taken over the house and practically destroyed the house
8778228 we were trying to keep it from falling down when we were working on it
8778229 unfortunately i believe this type of behavior is part of our society
8778230 its a wake up call for parents to have an open line of communication with their children
8778231 they need to know to have that talk with their child
8778232 a lot of children will never tell anyone whats happened to them
8778233 no one can cede jerusalem the city from which the prophet muhammad ascended to the heavens
8778234 jerusalem will be retrieved to the palestinians not through negotiations or by hugging and kissing the enemy but by way of jihad blood shahids and resistance with allahs help jerusalem will be returned
8778235 the israeli arabs are safeguarding the al aqsa mosque it is as if they are inside the belly of a whale they represent the islamic nation we send them our regards especially to sheikh raed salah founder of islamic movement in israel
8778236 according to most all reports on secret peace talks or agreements israel is refusing to relinquish jerusalem and the west bank refuses to accept the right of return of palestinian refugees refuses to dismantle the settlements and deems the jordan valley vital to its security
8778237 on behalf of the palestinian nation and muslims everywhere i say that we will not accept any such agreements
8778238 hamas leader well retrieve jerusalem only by way of jihad
8778239 you spend so much time on a computer and you dont know this
8778240 a personnel matter between the board and the clarks derrell jr has been asked to stay with the club and we hope he will
8778241 this may be a personnel matter to you but this is a personal matter to us these are our kids
8778242 sometimes the clarks are the only family values these children see if this organization is supposed to be family based what better people to run the club but a family
8778243 i dont think nepotism needs to be investigated you said you took months making this decision if theres a reason why theyre not here we as parents need to know
8778244 why did the decision come down on the first day of school if it wasnt made in haste a day when the club needed leadership
8778245 through word of mouth this club has grown and its because of the staff who treat these children like their own
8778246 my children have learned to follow rules because there are consequences for breaking those rules here and they learned respect for everyone from all walks of life
8778247 my biggest fear was that theyre gonna take god out of the program like they have in the public schools
8778248 somebody needs to talk about how this is affecting the children
8778249 miss clark said i could come to her and talk to her anytime if i was feeling sad
8778250 up in the high decks theyre in t shirts and cut offs except that everyones wearing obama stuff instead of bronco stuff
8778251 they want to hear about the scuttlebutt the big one this morning was the greek temple thing theyre calling it the barackopolis

8778256 the entire case was dismissed by a unanimous vote of the committee
8778257 john mccain says hed follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8778258 hi everyone im going to be blogging throughout barack obamas convention speech tonight so please keep refreshing the site
8778259 in the last few days ive entered a whole new web world its a place where people speak of getting
8778260 its fitting to have the eyes of the nation on colorado
8778261 its fitting that the change we need in washington starts here in the rocky mountain west it was hope that first carried early americans here not know what lay ahead but knowing they must go forward just as we must go forward and like those early americans we believe this is a land of fresh starts and boundless optimism we look to our mountains and prairies our wide open skies and we see the limitless possibility that is america
8778262 every generation has had to change this country to make it work and we democrats have always led that change
8778263 those words are just as true today my dad would be so proud to see a new generation gathered here in colorado the heart of the west ready to lead that change
8778264 this year the road to the white house cuts straight through the heart of the american west
8778265 we knew if we knocked on doors people would respect us and they would vote for us and they did
8778266 because you did these things we today are competitive in all 50 states
8778267 we need a president who understands the values of rural america
8778268 finland which does not resort to such practices has the worlds best schooling system by most benchmarks
8778269 the amount of money going into the system and hence overall teacher renumeration
8778270 we fix the school system by using money to renumerate the teachers
8778271 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8778272 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8778273 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8778274 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8778275 according to our information they are even starting to supply new types of weapons restoring the military infrastructure virtually all states that are supplying arms to georgia are nato member countries
8778276 these weapons which were supplied to georgia both overtly and covertly were eventually used against russian citizens who just happened to be killing georgians at the time
8778277 gina cobb is proof that not all lawyers deserve the death penalty

8778302 i was more defined by my fathers absence my grandparents lived in kansas grandfather worked in pattons army grandmother built bombers mom got him up at 4 30 a m to do his studies the only time his mom got really angry was when someone was bullied or treated differently
8778303 barack obama is a killer barack smith or barry obama not barack obama
8778304 you read about some injustice and you think someone should do something about that
8778305 imagine what its like being in someone elses shoes we recognize ourselves in others
8778306 thats the country i believe in thats whats worth fighting for
8778307 i accept your nomination for the president of the united states
8778308 broken washington and failed policies of george w bush america we are better than the last eight years
8778309 enough this moment this election is our chance to keep the american promise alive
8778310 let there be no doubt that john mccain has worn the uniform with honor senator mccain talks about judgment but what does it say about your judgment when you say bush is right 90 of the time
8778311 i dont think that john mccain doesnt care i just think he doesnt know
8778312 you are on your own even if you dont own boots youre on your own
8778313 change means not honoring the tax code written by lobbyists
8778314 i will cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8778315 within 10 years i will eliminate our dependence on foreign oil
8778316 ill invest 150 billion dollars in renewable energy that will create 5 million new jobs
8778317 insurance companies stop discriminating against the sick and need care the most
8778318 now many of these plans will cost money ill close corporate loopholes feeble clapping weird we cannot meet 21 century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy
8778319 fathers must take responsibility to provide love and guidance to their children
8778320 i will end the war responsibly i will tough diplomacy to deal with iran and russia paraphrase hell talk them to death oy vey
8778321 what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his position for political purposes
8778322 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8778323 i dont fit the typical pedigree but i stand before you tonight because in america something is stirring this election has never been about me its about you
8778324 one by one youve said enough to the politics of the past
8778325 the change doesnt come from washington it comes to washington
8778326 in america our destiny is inextricably linked we cannot walk alone the preacher cried america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done
8778327 when life gives you a thousand reasons to cry show life a million reasons to smile
8778328 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
8778329 everyone has internal damnation waiting to rear and wreak its vindictive and sadistic means
8778330 because i just realized that you mean more to me then my own life
8778331 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8778332 mccain may pay hundreds for his loafers but were the ones wholl be paying for his flip flops
8778333 the media will cover it in x way versus y
8778334 talk about being for something before you were against it
8778335 im happy with everything weve done so far this year this has been a strong season
8778336 arent you ever going to let nathan and haley be happy
8778337 well hold on a second these two are interesting together
8778338 can you have both can you be happy with both
8778339 i would like to apologise to everyone i texted last night
8778340 especially those of you i referred to as softcocks who shuld sic be out here partying n lookin 4 bitches sorry nanna
8778341 while it seemed like a good angle at the time
8778342 i can see that we should see dark knight tomorrow night cos i like u amp uve got great tits wasnt the best way to broach the subject of a potential relationship i just hope alice takes the compliment in the manner in which it was intended
8778343 and as for my follow up message do u kno where i can buy some speed the less said the better
8778344 i mustve been off my fucking tits to tell sarah she was my soulmate id only just got her to stop calling me in the middle of the night
8778345 i have absolutely no memory of sending it i didnt even know i had jareds number in my phone
8778346 ah well looks like im booked in for a fistfight at westfield figtree this thursday afternoon
8778347 im just glad the one where i told my boss i was quitting because he was a foureyed buttmuncher who smells like crotch and arse got stuck in drafts
8778348 i was ready to quit there and then but realised itd be a lot easier to follow her around now that she was unemployed
8778349 i used to have to sneak into nbc dressing rooms to smell beas clothes
8778350 now all i have to do is hang out at the local rheumatology department on wednesday afternoons
8778351 the first time i saw her playing liberal feminist maude findlay on all in the family my heart skipped a beat
8778352 if that happened now id be in serious danger of a coronary
8778353 i sat down to write bea yet another declaration of love and promise to murder barack obama and realised my letter was just a rehash of 1984s vow to wear mikhail gorbachevs face like a mask while i had rough sex with her
8778354 after 36 wonderful years our relationship was starting to get stale
8778355 walter wasnt just the best of us he was there from the beginning i never thought he was the kind of man to renege on a celebrity murder suicide pact
8778356 i guess its like they always say a man whos tired of stalking bea arthur is tired of life
8778357 we three fossils vow to put our name in the history books because it is ours and ours alone and no one can say its because of our grandfathers
8778358 wear the white belt carry an empty cup open your mind to learning as though for the first time
8778359 you take the blonde ill take the one in the turban
8778360 but i have so many tones available with the pod
8778361 itll probably be easier on both of us if we just take a break until we can see each other again
8778362 sheesh this guy needs to bite the bullet and get a wig already
8778363 i looked at the fixtures and noticed straight away that west ham away was the third game in
8778364 the trip to upton park was the one that stood out to me for some reason i cant think why not long ago i was looking at the fixtures and thinking about
8778365 now here i am looking at when we are going to be playing against manchester united and chelsea and west ham of course
8778366 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8778367 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8778368 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8778369 i think what i experienced so far is girls when they play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots
8778370 many times they play matches of their life not only in womens tennis also in mens
8778371 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8778372 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08
8778373 i dont have it lingering over my head will he get reinstated will he not get reinstated i just have to keep myself out of bad situations like i have been doing the last six or seven months
8778374 immediately i called my mom because ive been beating myself up but my mom has been through this roller coaster with me
8778375 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8778376 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8778377 i have to conduct myself like an nfl player to make sure none of these actions come again
8778378 i work hard every day to make sure i dont make the same mistakes can i say i would never ever make the same mistakes no i cant say that ill make sure i put myself in way better situations than i have put myself in the past
8778379 surrounding myself around the right people and staying out of gentlemens clubs having a great relationship with god and spending more time with my family
8778380 i think from the beginning there were a lot of critics saying that this couldnt be done that he couldnt turn his life around
8778381 im very happy for adam hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future
8778382 ive been waiting for this time for a long time but its not like we won a
8778383 a lesson in what happens when there is an unwillingness to evolve
8778384 gt tour and meet hundreds of online bloggin women from across the world vote for gigi as canadas mom entrepreneur of the year allis originals personalized sterling silver jewellery toronto ontario canada
8778385 why i want photos with gigi we have not had any family photos done since our thrid arrived over a year ago and now with three young kids we find it next to impossible to take any decent shots of all of them at once never mind trying to get us in the photos and well gillian is the best so i know she could handle our crazy crew
8778386 i was really excited when i read your blog because first i thought it was such a fun and creative idea and i knew right away what i wanted to do secondly because i have been admiring your photos for a while now and was dying to have some pictures done by you so im really excited for this contest so the reason i hope that i win is so that i get a some cute pictures of my boys together by you i never got any professional photos done for spencer so i feel kind of bad not having any plus i wouldnt want anyone else to take them but you
8778387 we would love the opportunity to have our photos done by gigi photography we are so desperate to live enjoy and remember the everyday moments that pass us by while our family grows in the timeless images that photography can capture past portraits with gigi photography adorn our walls as artwork the artwork of our family and our lives and remind us of how quickly our girls are growing up and to slow down and enjoy life as it happens now
8778388 have determined that the programming and services offered are not structured in a manner to support the needs of students with severe behavior issues
8778389 we didnt want to make them but given a 2 billion deficit we have little choice
8778390 i would like a better split also but i think it is reasonable
8778391 it would be three four times what manny has ever made i think worldwide manny is more popular than mayweather i dont think it would do two million but it would be very close we all know oscar is the draw
8778392 the only reason im taking this fight is because manny can win it
8778393 it puts him at a new level and a level he wants to be at i know we would have to fight a perfect fight to do it but i know he is capable of doing that
8778394 if we dont fight de la hoya they want to fight soto
8778395 i say soto the pound for pound best guy fighting soto that doesnt do much business if manny doesnt fight oscar i think he should sit out and fight ricky hatton next year
8778396 i think the oscar deal is a no lose situation and i strongly feel manny can win the fight and if he doesnt win the fight he doesnt have to pay me
8778397 first time vernon underestimated him and i think this time he is not going to do that this is like do or die for vernon
8778398 is he mora a possibility yes frankly so are a lot of other guys just about everybody you could think of is calling me and trying to make a case for their guy being the best opponent for de la hoya
8778399 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8778400 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8778401 we dont know whether thats going to happen or not
8778402 were generally happy with what weve been getting out of it and weve learned a tremendous amount
8778403 regardless of what happens to it were going to get this thing well written up and documented
8778404 est n desesperadamente temerosos del cambio que barack obama representa
8778405 pero aqu estamos todos en el 2008 y dudo que cualquiera pudiera argumentar ahora que esa elecci n no import
8778406 hoy enfrentamos esencialmente la misma elecci n que enfrentamos en el 2000

8778420 you need to worry about your friends and family you let around your children more so than stranger danger
8778421 not to diminish it but i think some of the fear is misplaced
8778422 a lot of people just let their kids run around at the park and dont pay a whole bunch of attention if there are a lot of of other parents around

8778442 i am relieved to find that federal judges are not above the law and that sexual abuse in the workplace is never acceptable no matter the status of the offender
8778443 they worked together for six years on a daily basis
8778444 the first time she ever complained was when she was about to get fired this is a classic swearing match

8778452 one would reason that in a period of economic expansion everyones boat would be rising but families and children in particular did not benefit

8778460 sony has always captivated its customers by creating products that merge technologies and push the boundaries of innovation and we are encouraged to see the amount of interest evoked by rolly
8778461 it shouldnt be the rule it goes against the public markets policy of the government which requires them to stimulate competition and look for local alternatives its really an absurdity
8778462 we think we have a real good team this year and were going to surprise some people
8778463 quit talking about it and just record the damn thing we can hate it later
8778464 the hilarity commonly produced by simply imagining the toes the fingers have come to signify useful action and firm character the toes stupor and base idiocy
8778465 the event comes exactly 45 years since martin luther kings
8778466 well see what happens but were in good shape the gap in the championship is big but well keep fighting until its over
8778467 we had a great result at misano last year and that added to the fact that were in good shape with the set up and the tyres means we can be reasonably confident of another good result here
8778468 im really excited to be going to misano in such good shape and leading the championship
8778469 last year the race was a huge disappointment for us a very low point of the season and especially sad because it happened in front of my home fans
8778470 but this time things are very different weve had two fantastic races in a row and we are feeling very strong and very confident we are out to make up for 2007
8778471 misano is so close to my home town of tavullia that i know there will be an army of italian fans there and i hope its going to be a great party for all of them
8778472 last year there was some terrible weather before the race as well so i really hope that this year we have sunshine and we can enjoy a fantastic race by the sea
8778473 everyone will finish behind us inter are still the best
8778474 hes the most complete coach ive ever had on the pitch and off it
8778475 hes meticulous about every little detail with us and it seems also with journalists
8778476 i heard him talking when he was at chelsea and after one and a half months of knowing him ive only positive things to say
8778477 you can see straight away the difference to other coaches now theres a new spirit the team has more confidence in itself
8778478 obviously im delighted to come back to city and i cant wait to get started again
8778479 ive always admired shaun and hes been a target of mine since i came to the club
8778480 to actually secure the deal and bring shaun back home is a fantastic coup for us
8778481 im sure the supporters will be just as excited as we are to have him back at manchester city

8778485 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8778486 a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8778487 i know that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the middle east and strengthen the recruitment arm of al qaida
8778488 a successful war against iraq would require a u s occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences
8778489 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that

8778497 only those christians who have obeyed christ and have been properly baptized baptism meaning
8778498 refuse to receive persons whom we consider unbaptized when they will not receive their own baptized members
8778499 i offered to trade her a fattening hog for those girls
8778500 i meant it as a joke ive said it a million times most people get a kick out of it

8778504 hell certainly be coming as part of the squad but if we do get his clearance through hell definitely be involved somewhere down the line
8778505 from the under 17 australian teams all the way to the full national team
8778506 vince is a fantastic player more of a defensive midfielder and again i think he is going to bring something to this team and be a major asset for us
8778507 i looked at the fixtures and noticed straight away that west ham away was the third game in
8778508 the trip to upton park was the one that stood out to me for some reason i cant think why
8778509 not long ago i was looking at the fixtures and thinking about darlington and rochdale no disrespect to them
8778510 now here i am looking at when we are going to be playing against manchester united and chelsea and west ham of course
8778511 im howard dean im the chairman of the democratic national committee and i know exactly how many houses i own

8778514 you see all the people here theyre from all walks of life all colors and creeds
8778515 its those moments of humanity not everything was staged and orchestrated the tremendous affection that people have for one another it really showed through
8778516 weve come a long way but we still have a distance to go
8778517 weve come a long way but we must march again on november 4 we must march in every state in every city in every village in every hamlet we must march to the ballot box we must march like we have never marched before to elect the next president of the united states senator barack obama

8778519 but even if crew leaves feldmans victory is still important if indeed he does align himself with the current minority of renier diaz de la portilla marta perez ana rivas logan and vice chair perla hantman all of whom voted to terminate crews contract then a cuban american agenda will take hold on the board
8778520 this would include an increase in bilingual education more support for voucher schools and possibly the appointment of a cuban american to replace crew if he is fired or quits
8778521 a cuban american majority might also set off a racial conflict according to brian peterson editor of the miami education review a very close observer of racial politics in mdcps peterson fears that a cuban american majority might try to fire many black employees and hire cubans in their place
8778522 the tension between the two ethnic groups bubbled over at the aug
8778523 this is the district feldman inherits mdcps is plagued with financial hardship of epic proportions uncertain leadership and a brewing race war td has faith in the 1 a year principals abilities but it is going to take more than a symbolic gesture to keep mdcps from crashing and burning we hope the newest board member is prepared for whats coming to him
8778524 except to try to get my parents to vote for him
8778525 its been awhile since there has been something this hopeful
8778526 young people have to realize that after nov 4 the work has to continue
8778527 i never gave up hope until the last seven years
8778528 now today this convention is so emotional its incredible there arent really words to describe what i feel
8778529 it may be possible we can be the america we hoped for all these years
8778530 i remember when blacks and whites couldnt sit down at the same table to eat
8778531 that a black man would ever get to this point
8778532 i knew i had a long time my mother lived to be 95
8778533 i went to get a drink and a black lady had to tell me i couldnt drink the water
8778534 others didnt succeed before him and im glad this is coming

8778538 with the federal government not investing not setting good regulatory mechanisms and basically taking a back seat on everything except drilling and fossil fuels the grid has not been modernized especially for wind energy

8778542 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8778543 arkansas needs to affirm the importance of married mothers and fathers
8778544 we need to publicly affirm the gold standard of rearing children whenever we can the state standard should be as close to that gold standard of married mom and dad homes as possible

8778551 i went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago we described this to intelligence agencies and to the national security council in detail
8778552 already the prices of pulses mustard oil and soap have gone up although the rise is not steep now it will shoot up in the next few days if the dharna continues
8778553 i do not support mamatas way of protesting she began an agitation for the people of singur but they are the ones who are hit by this price rise
8778554 she shaped the insurance business and also played a major role in icici banks corporate banking business
8778555 our hope is to resolve the issue at road atlanta
8778556 im producing a document that will layout who what when where and why of everything up to this point when things were received more detailed information about our inspection and well give that to yoshimura rockstar makita suzuki then they can send in their paperwork off of that
8778557 i know shannonville so much ive raced here in the regionals for a long time its a fun track pretty technical and theres a lot of braking and im usually pretty good in the braking
8778558 the nationals have been going better for me than i thought
8778559 i didnt really come into the year with any goals im really happy with what ive achieved id like to finish 10th in the pro 600 class
8778560 it was very educational you really learn to appreciate what you have here
8778561 these guys from start to finish they just go at 110 per cent
8778562 theres no messing around the races are longer so its very tiring and with the extra practice from doing two classes im spending more time on the bike i try to conserve my energy but i always want to go as hard as i can when i get out on the track
8778563 but ive learned a lot i know these guys respect me as a racer and im glad i can be competitive with guys at my experience level im having more fun this year i feel like i have nothing to prove im racing with better riders and im learning a lot just by following them
8778564 ive had some time to relax and go to the beach which was good for me i feel revived my arm is ok just a little swollen
8778565 hes so good he knows how the bikes work and he knows how to coach me to get the best out of them
8778566 my dad is my greatest fan its not always easy for him to see me on the track but hes having fun even though hes supposed to be retired hes a good communicator he doesnt stress he reminds me that im supposed to be here for fun he doesnt put any pressure on me and its not easy being on the track with these guys can be pretty discouraging sometimes
8778567 i think i have a good combination of professional work and a hobby
8778568 if i just had my job i dont know what i would do with myself im always active i dont just sit on the couch i think my life is pretty good
8778569 it took six years for india to understand the sensitivities of asean and for the asean to understand the sensitivities of india
8778570 the countries of east asia are important drivers of growth with large consumption to drive global economies
8778571 india is ready the onus is on asean to gather its team and start negotiations on services and investment
8778572 the fta in goods will be vital for expanding the space for economic engagement between our two economies there is a need for an early start of negotiations in services and investment so that we can reap the full benefits of a comprehensive economic co operation agreement
8778573 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8778574 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their as well
8778575 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8778576 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our american promise has been threatened once more
8778577 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8778578 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8778579 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8778580 during the lunch hour i went around and talked to as many of the riders as i could find
8778581 as a single bike single line portion of the course its fantastic it does what its supposed to do but for full competition racing we feel the old turn four is going to be safer
8778582 he asked how it new turn four chicane was and i said the corner is fine for a rider by himself
8778583 obviously theres issues with the track thats why they made the change ive seen bikes go down and hit that wall outside the old turn four but you dont want a bike t boning someone else going around on the racing line either way its not a good situation
8778584 weve already discussed some things that could be done to the new turn four to open it up and ease it so its not quite as tight especially at the exit
8778585 so i see us using it in the future once a little bit of work is done to it the tracks aware of it theyre behind it theyre supportive of that so as early as next year we could be back to using the new turn four in a slightly different configuration
8778586 america we are better than the last 8 years we are a better country than this
8778587 enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8778588 we love this country too much to let the next 4 years look like the last 8
8778589 im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8778590 merlyn was always willing to offer his expertise and support to racers and technicians at all levels including privateers and those on competing teams
8778591 he treated everyone with respect and was a mentor to all he believed everyone should be given the opportunity to achieve their dreams and goals merlyns scholarships are intended to help support the next generation of top motorcycle technicians and pave the way for men and women of similar character to thrive in the sport that he loved so much
8778592 merlyn plumlee was a remarkable man dedicated to helping others
8778593 we are thrilled to be associated with mrs plumlee and the merlyn plumlee memorial scholarship program and announce the three scholarship winners programs like this will help deserving students who might not have had a chance otherwise follow their motorcycle dream
8778594 what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose and that is what we have to restore
8778595 i know that there are those who dismiss such ideas as happy talk
8778596 if you dont have any fresh ideas you use scare tactics you make a big election about small things it feeds into the cynicism that we all have about government
8778597 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office this election has never been about me its about you
8778598 mama why do you always take the pointy end and give daddy the stubby end
8778599 i am starting to believe that there is no such thing as tragedy there is only opportunity for growth and should you accept it the reward overcomes the sailing of the hardship
8778600 we want to convey in no uncertain terms to the secretary general that india is thoroughly displeased
8778601 they will surely look upon it as a golden opportunity to rake up the issue on a un platform something which has been denied to them for several years
8778602 we are better than the last eight years we are a better country than this
8778603 we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8778604 what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right 90 percent of the time
8778605 damit rund 115 000 qm ausstellungs und showfl che zur verf gung
8778606 i am disturbed by the arrest of over 700 of my party workers by the police in a surprise overnight operation my party wants to restore marathi asmita pride and that is why we have taken up the issue of marathi on signboards but i am now appealing to my party workers to stay calm
8778607 we will think of a new course of action if they fail to act
8778608 the police insisted on keeping our men in the lock up for 14 days the government wants to crush our party but it will not succeed
8778609 the state government accuses me of taking the law into my hands but it has itself failed to enforce the shops and establishments act 1961
8778610 we are endurance racers and we have raced around europe and also in japan
8778611 and in this series we are racing against some big names we are very proud for that
8778612 in italy i endurance race an mv agusta with a lot more horsepower here i do the best i can but its not easy but we are having fun and that is the first issue
8778613 evacuation has been given the top priority and 532 boats have been pressed into service for the purpose
8778614 i dont believe john mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans he just doesnt know
8778615 i dont think sen mccain doesnt care about whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8778616 its time for us to change america and thats why im running for president of the united states
8778617 when you look at the spending it looks terrible for the second half of the year
8778618 weve begun the process of slipping into a good old fashioned recession
8778619 we have been helpful in the past for a number of sports gymnastics basketball netball hockey and others
8778620 i would be happy to investigate this partnership with plc for a synthetic athletics track
8778621 we want to provide a service that will pick up recyclables
8778622 a lot of food waste and stuff is just going into big bins and not being separated
8778623 we want to recycle all the different components of the waste that can be recycled from businesses
8778624 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8778625 certainly historically theres been an increase usually the following season theres an increase in interested people coming along and trying it
8778626 its a very social thing and its become much more family oriented
8778627 i would say probably the only thing that pulls armidale up is the weather
8778628 although these cupcakes put the seasons best berries to good use they are also perfect for those berries that arrive at your market from far away and have little juice and less flavor than good local berries if you are using juicy berries drain them well and use only the juice that clings to them when the berries have been chopped for the cake and the frosting a pinch of cinnamon picks up the strawberry flavor in the cup cake batter
8778629 i watch it all the time i love seeing the updates and how people are doing
8778630 i was a little nervous at first to be honest with you
8778631 with the subject matter and singing you make cash giving head and you use it to buy sudafed did i really want my young fans hearing me say that
8778632 the air conditioning broke in that room and we were dying from the heat
8778633 i do find the video so funny im sorry but i do have that sense of humor
8778634 i may have to include it as a bonus track
8778635 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8778636 all of us at showtime wish david and his family the best during this very private time
8778637 in breach of fundamental norms and principles of international law on the sovereignty territorial integrity and inviolability of the state frontiers
8778638 directly contradicts all resolutions on georgia adopted by the security council
8778639 we are complying with the cease fire agreement and fully commit ourselves to it
8778640 we demand the same action from the other parties in the conflict
8778641 todays meeting of the security council cannot be fully valid without the participation of the representatives of abkhazia and south ossetia
8778642 without an understanding of the aspirations of the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia it is impossible to have an objective picture of what is taking place

8778734 around the world there is a real recognition now that deforestation is one of the major drivers of climate change and a recognition that primary forests are huge carbon stores and they know that their investors their shareholders are going to be very unhappy she said
8778735 the environment message has been out there for years and finally the australian and tasmanian governments are getting the message that shareholders are going to drive companies to actually get out of native forests
8778736 peter garrett must draw the line under the project and say its over
8778737 we need to hear from minister garrett and the tasmanian government that there will be no extensions no rolling over
8778738 clearly peter garrett has lost the passion senator milne said
8778739 the question is has he got the backbone to exercise the power
8778740 hes rolled over on beverley will he roll over on the pulp mill
8778741 will he give gunns that extension or will he agree that october the 4th is the cut off
8778742 the ball is absolutely in his court the country is looking to see if the peter garrett they thought they knew still exists

8778747 we have got a problem now with the company it is being run by people who dont have ink in their veins
8778748 and this latest act is basically bowing to the market and saying weve got a market downturn here and what do we do we reach for the knife this is really a pretty brutal way of doing it
8778749 in discussion that weve had in the last couple of days theyve said not only the canberra bureaux of the two great newspapers are on the table but also so too are foreign bureaux
8778750 you can slim it down to one bureau in canberra covering everything but you end up diminishing the analysis of the democratic process and very seriously so

8778752 get out of our heads and get into our hearts
8778753 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
8778754 the reason this election is so close is because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8778755 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one

8778763 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents julian walsh acting atsb executive director said today
8778764 the passengers were obviously very lucky atsb investigator julian walsh said in canberra
8778765 it was evident that one passenger oxygen cylinder had sustained a sudden failure and forceful discharge of its pressurised contents into the aircraft hold rupturing the fuselage in the vicinity of the wing fuselage leading edge fairing
8778766 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering the cabin adjacent to the second main cabin door
8778767 the cylinder had subsequently impacted the door frame door handle and overhead panelling before falling to the cabin floor and exiting the aircraft through the ruptured fuselage
8778768 these oxygen bottles are actually quite robust so it would take some significant force to do some damage like that
8778769 theres nothing at this stage that the atsb can identify that could have been done to prevent this we dont really know why the bottle failed thats the key question for the investigation
8778770 anythings possible its certainly a rare event but no one can discount the possibility of those sort of things happening mr walsh said
8778771 as far as we can tell from all the information thats available to us the crew have pretty much done a textbook response mr walsh said

8778798 this is great news for stroke survivors because results clearly demonstrate that long term stroke damage is not immutable and that with exercise its never too late for the brain and body to recover
8778799 this suggests that the brain is responsible for the improvement we saw in patients walking ability it seems to be recruiting other regions to take on the job of areas damaged by stroke
8778800 many stroke survivors believe theres nothing to be gained from further rehabilitation but our results suggest that health and functional benefits from walking on a treadmill can occur even decades out from stroke

8778832 the fact that they have referenced blu ray in their publicity has put the cat among the proverbial pigeons because the blu ray standard was always intended to be untouchable as a video quality industry benchmark the blu ray disc association is fighting back with claims that satellite companies cannot technically match the blu ray experience and that it will do whatever it can to ensure that consumers are not being misled
8778833 these comparisons are irresponsible and are misleading to consumers upconversion and satellite broadcast cannot provide a true blu ray high definition experience as neither is technically capable of producing the quality delivered by blu ray players and blu ray discs to that end the blu ray disc association is exploring these claims further and will take appropriate action as necessary to prevent consumers seeking the ultimate in high definition home entertainment from being misled

8778905 the preseason is over and kansas city is coming in we have to be ready nobody is waiting for us we had a bad day but we have to put that behind us there are no concerns we have to move forward and move on
8778906 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8778907 all of us at showtime wish david and his family the best during this very private time
8778908 if you watch the film not many get around him and he can squash you
8778909 that is my goal on every play drive them back as far as i can right onto their back
8778910 i love it my dad tells me he wants a decleater on every play and thats what i try to give him thats what coaches like to see
8778911 we see a lot of nose guards and we want to make sure theyre neutralized
8778912 im learning the snaps learning the plays learning how to read linebackers
8778913 its a good experience because now i know every position and it will help me for college
8778914 i get to feel the history of the people who played there
8778915 the baseball coach asked me to come out and i considered that sc likes it that i play three sports for people who say focus on one sport im always going to be focused on football but its nice to enjoy the sports im playing basketball prepares me with my footwork and track is more lifting and helps with strength
8778916 i always say sisters not twins when it come to eyebrows
8778917 try as we might to get them completely symmetrical you have two completely different hair patterns and amounts of hair on each side of the face
8778918 this allows you to see the natural growth pattern and shape of your eyebrows
8778919 get a pair of good tweezers with sharp slanted edges and pull hairs in the direction of growth
8778920 not sure where your eyebrows should be run your finger along your eyebrow bone
8778921 if you draw an invisible line from the corner of the nose straight up towards the forehead this is where the eyebrows should start the arch should fall just outside the pupil and should go all the way across the brow bone
8778922 using vegetable dyes to either lighten or darken the eyebrows is the best way to soften a hard look or add fullness and definition to a lighter sparse looking eyebrow
8778923 powder works best on oily skins and pencil on more mature or drier skins
8778924 not only do eyebrows serve as the frame to your eyes and face
8778925 but their main function is to keep irritants out of our eyes
8778926 brush eyebrows straight up and trim the hairs that stick out too far one at a time then do the same brushing hair down
8778927 after pulling a few hairs step back and look at the entire face
8778928 if you cant see the hair in a regular mirror then neither can anyone else
8778929 it is an old eyebrow myth that is heard too often to never tweeze from the top
8778930 every eyebrow is different and while some dont need this it is often required to achieve the perfect shape
8778931 more receivers down the field and all over the place
8778932 a lot of people i talk to go to every game every basketball game football game
8778933 i dont even have a grandson playing on this team mines on jv but i never miss a game
8778934 itll be good for the kids to play before school starts you know get their lips back in shape
8778935 im still enthusiastic about downtown i still think downtown has an incredible amount of potential
8778936 but i dont think it was in the cards for the coffee shop at this point
8778937 its very sad to see downtown without a coffee shop
8778938 it was a gathering place for many and it will be missed
8778939 i feel very badly because i feel that it was a dream that for whatever reason didnt work out and i hate that for people
8778940 i look at it kind of as a parent you really want young people to have dreams and to work hard and have their dreams come to fruition i hurt on their behalf
8778941 we have a thriving downtown i can attest to business downtown quite honestly never being better
8778942 theres still a lot of opportunity and a lot of support for downtown im convinced of that
8778943 dress it up with a belt and a bright bag this season
8778944 hitting at the waist or just below in brown or grey or over a flowery top for work and a vintage tee on weekends
8778945 there seem to be a lot of patterns in dress shirts and stripes in ties are strong
8778946 no no dont get that one try the lightest color of time balm its called lighter than light it will work much better with her complexion
8778947 its the middle of the day but there are no people and no cars around its too quiet thats a classic combat indicator there may be an ied improvised explosive device up ahead
8778948 stay in the middle of the road gunner scan the balconies and side streets for a spotter
8778949 weve got a lot of commitments with iraq and afghanistan at the moment
8778950 the ideal solution would be to take soldiers in a convoy down to the centre of salisbury on a saturday afternoon but im not sure the shoppers would like having machine guns pointed at them very much
8778951 virtual training is safe and it maximises the benefits of real life training it even means that someone who doesnt have a driving licence can gain experience of driving in a convoy
8778952 when i first saw it i didnt know how useful it was going to be but the trainings been really helpful
8778953 we all play computer games but this isnt just a game its serious
8778954 im sure its going to help me when i get out to theatre
8778955 fillers such as juvederm for the laugh lines lip lines and cheek augmentation can be used botox is wonderful for the crows feet frown lines and glabella between the eyebrows
8778956 the events happened in new york and its a disadvantage to transfer everything here
8778957 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8778958 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8778959 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
8778960 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
8778961 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

8778965 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
8778966 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
8778967 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
8778968 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
8778969 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
8778970 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
8778971 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
8778972 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
8778973 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
8778974 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
8778975 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8778976 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8778977 failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8778978 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8778979 has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
8778980 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 of the time sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 of the time
8778981 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change

8779000 well ive already paid you for five years on this lease if im going to keep it i want a discount
8779001 no big deal no surprise what took you so long
8779002 you know guys we really like you but we cant sit here and take this kind of price increase or pay these kind of prices when i have got abc company with five rigs they can give me tomorrow
8779003 you know what things are not as good as we thought they were going to be in minerals and thats bad news but the good news is were getting ready to pick up the driller in this location or that or this
8779004 okay we would be happy to share in a bigger way the equity in layne energy or the working interest or whatever you work out
8779005 exposing voters to a rigorous debate of the critical issues facing this nation today is a cornerstone of the democratic election process in america
8779006 it is regrettable that former governor warner has chosen to deny virginians that opportunity by declining this statewide broadcast opportunity
8779007 i know mark warner is leading in the polls but i find his decision not to debate jim gilmore curious the recent history of politicians who refuse to debate their opponents in virginia is that of defeat
8779008 there are so many vital issues that need to be fully aired for voters of the commonwealth that i ask the league of women voters to hold their debate anyway i would certainly be there and would debate former governor gilmore on any topic that is germane to the u s senate race in virginia this year the voters of virginia deserve no less
8779009 the leaders agreed that any attempt to solve problems by merely resorting to force could not work and would only hinder a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts the declaration said a comprehensive solution to existing problems can be found only by taking into account the interests of all parties involved and including them all in the negotiation process rather than isolating any of them any attempt to strengthen a countrys own security at the expense of that of others is detrimental to maintaining global security and stability on the issue of south ossetia the sco members expressed their deep concerns over the tension triggered by the south ossetia conflict and called on relevant parties to solve existing problems peacefully through dialogue strive for reconciliation and push for negotiations the sco states welcome the adoption in moscow on august 12 of six principles of settling the conflict in south ossetia and support russia s active role in contributing to peace and co operation in the region
8779010 gina cobb is proof that not all lawyers deserve the death penalty
8779011 the whole world is watching i hope that all the complacent americans the ones whove given up have endured all these years and had to give up food and medicine cause they cant afford gas i hope they realize its time to pick up this country and get it standing up again
8779012 surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
8779013 its not so much a confidence booster for me but it was a matter of getting them back out there and not having what happened the week before i think we accomplished that not having a guy in jasons space
8779014 from that standpoint i was absolutely pleased if there was any redeeming quality about putting that first group out there it was that
8779015 i watched it close i think there was only one poor punt one short one we tried to directional punt most of the night and i thought it went pretty well we had them back there a couple of times the decision wont be made on one poor punt tonight or one great punt tonight
8779016 ready to step in there for a big league game
8779017 were fortunate that theyre in a supporting role right now we do have a veteran team and we can play the guys that weve been itching to line up and play a whole game with
8779018 add one packet to glass add 8 oz of cold water bottled or filtered is best and stir well to dissolve
8779019 this mix dissolves quickly and i dont get issues with lumps of powder
8779020 plain rubbing alcohol on a dust free cloth can be used on the stamp surface to clean any dirt which may build up never rub the stamp surface hard or allow sharp objects to come in contact with the rubber
8779021 kemarin kompolnas komisi kepolisian nasional memberikan masukan untuk diperpanjang presiden akan pertimbangkan
8779022 perluasan ini sangat perlu untuk mengembalikan fungsi hutan tesso nilo sebagai konservasi gajah sumatra sekarang ini populasi gajah terus menyusut akibat habitatnya terganggu oleh perambahan hutan kalau sudah habitatnya dirusak maka konflik pun terjadi
8779023 perluasan ini akan membantu menyelamatkan populasi kelompok gajah yang masih di luar taman nasional di areal itu juga akan dibangun parit gajah untuk mengatasi konflik dengan manusia

8779025 anytime you play a program that is used to winning they bring a little bit more to the table
8779026 coach jerry moore has the program as competitive as there is in college football
8779027 our fans will talk about that 20 years from now
8779028 weve been able to put it in proper perspective and tried to prepare for lsu as best we can we know were huge underdogs but were looking forward to it and hopefully it will make us a better football team
8779029 maybe this is how it works for hollywood stars but its not certainly not typical for an olympic athlete
8779030 its no secret he loves mcdonalds and has ever since ive known him
8779031 i said i dont want to retire before the age of 30 right now im not sure
8779032 i really do have a great balanced diet there are some things where i do like to indulge i think everybody does
8779033 thats how i actually started swimming my mom wanted me and my sisters to be water safe
8779034 im interested to see how my comedy is hopefully its pretty good
8779035 that would be cool i have no idea who i could see playing myself
8779036 even if we planned to name a starter we couldnt right now
8779037 well find out more about kyle in the next couple of days we dont know about troy well see what the next few days bring
8779038 they both know how much they have to lose so i dont think that this will last much longer
8779039 we certainly dont want to put ourselves in a situation that we didnt have to be in because i did something silly or we had a mechanical problem
8779040 but at the same time you have to compete at a high level the competition is too tough
8779041 all those people are real good at their jobs and i think theyre probably all going to be very tough
8779042 when a guy has played as long as hasselbecks played or some other quarterbacks around the league have played youre not quite as concerned with your minutes in the preseason
8779043 then i hope to be full go next week and ready for the season opener
8779044 what he needs to see is a comfort level of people falling around his feet
8779045 it will save the throws in his arm it will keep him fresh
8779046 we felt like our crowd and our community was deserving of us bringing a quality opponent in to see what were able to do with a perennial powerhouse such as poly we very excited
8779047 a lot of our kids dont get a chance to get out of the area very much its very much a plus to get this kind of exposure and the kids expose themselves to other parts of the united states
8779048 i hear they do like us they just kind of reload
8779049 hes in the mold of jacory but were not asking him to do the same things
8779050 by the time hes a senior well be asking him to do those things
8779051 its a highly competitive atmosphere and if you cant do that on a football field i think were kidding ourselves
8779052 were having a good time thats really all it is
8779053 its unfortunate that a couple of things that were caught by television cameras were blown way out of proportion
8779054 i dont think it looks good jawing with fans i will tone that down
8779055 i was not being derogatory to those colts fans i spent four quarters in the game and i felt like i knew them but it didnt come across great on tv and im the first to acknowledge that
8779056 philip made his mark to the world that hes the leader of this team
8779057 thats a quarterback who played on a torn acl not a defensive lineman a linebacker or a tight end
8779058 he earned new respect with his team and around the league
8779059 you have to be who you are its funny theres some quarterbacks who get a lot of heat in the nfl for not showing any emotion
8779060 the chargers are 25 7 with philip as the starter including 15 1 at home
8779061 he takes advantage of being with good players most of the great quarterbacks with that kind of record have that fortunate advantage
8779062 but if you wanted to write a manual about how to come back from acl surgery philip did that this offseason ive never seen anyone approach knee rehab the way he did with the time and energy he committed to getting back as quickly as he did
8779063 just to have an offseason with philip really helps my game and im looking forward to this season
8779064 hes a great guy to be around with a great personality i wish people could get to know him
8779065 people forget hes just a fifth year quarterback and hell be better and more mature this season
8779066 the best thing chris does for vincent is he drags a lot of attention away from him and there are a lot of open windows in cover 2 for a guy like vincent to make plays
8779067 a lot of defensive backs are taught run run and when you see the receivers hands go up get ready to chop down
8779068 if you want to get to that next level you have to really get to know one another chris and i have had a great offseason together
8779069 i dont want to think about it i dont want to talk about it
8779070 i know i can still do this i know that my reflexes are still there
8779071 for me as a 35 year old fighter it really is a big challenge
8779072 im faster and stronger than him and im younger i can beat him in the way i beat diaz in my last fight my speed is going to be effective in this fight
8779073 i do have to change my style around i do have to adjust to his speed
8779074 i know hes a strong fighter and i have to figure out a way to pull the trigger i have to find a way to increase my speed i have quite a task in front of me
8779075 we have to figure out quick how were going to neutralize him its going to be an explosive fight my pride and mannys pride
8779076 its something that hasnt been done before and the usa says whoever comes up with something can keep it
8779077 you cant help but notice how little credit i get
8779078 we were talking with lsu and they wanted a home game
8779079 some things didnt work out appalachian state would take a shot its kind of neat
8779080 we must not have a lot of talent if we have the general manager and the coach on a billboard
8779081 nah the whole new beginning thing is a good slogan and i like it coming from 1 15 you have to start somewhere you have to end something to start something
8779082 when your name is on it and its not going well it doesnt make any difference how many championships youve won or how many super bowls or how many division titles
8779083 youre not winning now so you become one of the ones who arent winning now i do feel pressure to improve this situation
8779084 taylor and zach its wild to look and not see either one of them
8779085 they set a mode the way were going to practice the way were going to prepare and how were going to compete
8779086 i think you either live up to it or youll be shipped out
8779087 one of them is a senior ive seen him play one time right now there are some things that way that you sacrifice
8779088 every day out here were working a different situation with the players
8779089 its all part of them understanding ways to win ways to lose
8779090 we have one of the greatest teachers in the history of mankind who kind of emanates around this place in john wooden one of his great sayings is be quick but dont hurry nothing could be truer of the coaching profession be quick be creative but you dont have to hurry
8779091 he says when preparation meets opportunity thats when success happens
8779092 in 2002 my last year pete carroll was a good coach
8779093 he came by and said heres the keys to a bmw and a bottle of champagne
8779094 my wife told him we dont drink so a box of ice cream probably would have been better the bmw that was his he took it back
8779095 you can find humor in it that so much was made over kind of an american institution but it didnt just affect me it affected a lot of people there were no happy endings
8779096 we had to look at all those issues in the aggregate
8779097 the due diligence included conversations with the folks at the other two universities that were involved the ncaa the pacific 10 conference i had to feel in my heart that all of that was behind him once we went through that process i felt very good
8779098 coaches are always guilty of the notion that well i dont have a real quantity amount of time but the quality is really high well thats one of the great lies of all time
8779099 your rationalization button just goes to an all time high
8779100 you want somebody to say hey how can they be doing this but you know what at the end of the day it just doesnt help it happened im sorry lets move on
8779101 the bitterness and the retribution and all the different things you feel because theyre human emotions theyre wasted youve just got to focus on all the good things youve got going on and at the end of the day youll see your way out of it
8779102 youve got to trust your coaches that they dont get those shaded glasses that but hes such a good player coach that can happen to all of us
8779103 i catch myself as a dad doing it dont do it again rather than administering the discipline its easier because theyll like you more and they promise you theyre not going to do it again but you just have to do it then the question is how much ive made mistakes in the past
8779104 id suspended him for the michigan game which was a huge game but i told him id let it be half the game if he got it all done as an incentive as i look back it was the wrong message
8779105 it looked as if i was desperate and id give up things to find ways to get guys to play and i wasnt telling the kid that he needed to focus on what hed done wrong
8779106 from what i witnessed from the sideline it was never intended to circumvent the rules we work in a competitive business and that includes recruiting i think some areas got pushed too far
8779107 i was so focused on trying to rise to the top not me personally but the team that i wasnt paying attention to the details like how many miles a recruit was driving from his home to the airport i kept thinking other people would take care of that
8779108 you dont have to have this paranoia that exists in our profession that somebody else is out there getting this basically thats where my head was when i was 33 i was trying to look for the loophole in law school you always are searching for an angle
8779109 but as i said to ad guerrero in my interview im at a point in my life where i know i can do this job i dont have to take shortcuts i might lose a recruit that i might have gotten years ago but that recruit wont help me win games if thats what i would have needed to do to get him or build the kind of program i want to build
8779110 youre sitting there youve got this great plan you cant wait to get better as a coach and all of a sudden theyre gone
8779111 if one person wasnt in it we wouldnt have done it
8779112 hes like a player himself he makes us feel comfortable everyone im telling you everyone likes playing for coach neuheisel
8779113 the perception is that everything has changed ive heard people say that hes trying to change the culture and thats not true at all
8779114 im embracing the culture are we running a new system as far as plays and maybe some different training methods sure
8779115 were still going to sing hail to the victors after games if we win
8779116 youre going to see the winged helmet running out of the spread its crazy
8779117 we have absolutely no idea what to expect from michigan this season especially on offense which makes this one of the most interesting seasons in my lifetime
8779118 its going to be so cool to see a michigan team running the spread it might take a few seasons but hes building a program that can compete with the sec and usc for the national title and especially a program that can beat ohio state i dont care that hes an outsider we probably needed an outsider to move the program in the right direction
8779119 one night in cedar point was all we could scrounge together we brought some bologna put it in the cooler but we had a good time on the demon drop
8779120 were going to be who are im a small town guy who cut my teeth coaching small college football
8779121 i havent asked what it was like before because i dont care my door is always open players never have an appointment to see the coach i want to have a bunch of coaches who like what theyre doing and crack a few jokes and have some fun i know its serious business but its not life and death no one likes winning more than me i can promise you that but there are things more important and thats why i have such a great job i get paid really good for doing a job thats a lot of fun
8779122 those who thought lloyd carr was too boring are psyched but with everything that happened this summer the traditional michigan fan is very very skittish
8779123 the impression that some people have is that hes not going to be on the up and up and now michigan could be like every other program
8779124 all the tough stuff is behind us and he can focus now on the program
8779125 sometimes its just heat of the moment if he sees something good he cusses if he sees something bad he cusses but you know when its good and bad hes just excited
8779126 do i curse at practice some too much yeah at times but im a lot better than i used to be i used to be worse
8779127 rodriguez is a young bo schembechler with a southern accent
8779128 usually we can watch film back to 96 on michigan and its the same stuff the same ideas
8779129 now youre just going to have a certain number of games to watch them on its a bigger challenge it makes the battle more exciting
8779130 it was just time for change because everyone kind of knew exactly what we were going to do

8779209 i dont know what kind of lives mccain thinks celebrities lead
8779210 mccains silly buffoonish celeb attack shows that hes the one whos out of touch with what ordinary people want from a president right now

8779255 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
8779256 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
8779257 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest

8779282 the shale production story is certainly a good news story

8779290 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well

8779363 it got to a point where we had signed up a lot of korean members and it wasnt long until they were breaking many of the rules and werent participating because they couldnt read anything or speak or communicate with us
8779364 its very satisfying to see a project this complex come to fruition
8779365 no one including the task force knew what the outcome would be it took many twists and turns
8779366 thats what inspired my interest it became really important to me
8779367 im thrilled and i applaud the city for sticking with it
8779368 i had not worked with government per se and i didnt have any expectation that it would take this long
8779369 it took a while for the city to figure out how to make it work financially
8779370 its very satisfying to see a project this complex come to fruition woodhouse said
8779371 we feel fortunate to be sending our child here said parent fernando vargas whose daughter chelsea 2 was playing in the community resource room thursday
8779372 this place is beautiful he said standing in the playground
8779373 thats what inspired my interest it became really important to me
8779374 im thrilled and i applaud the city for sticking with it said richter who is now retired
8779375 i had not worked with government per se and i didnt have any expectation that it would take this long
8779376 it took a while for the city to figure out how to make it work financially said nadine levine assistant city manager who saw the project from beginning to end
8779377 its nice to be on this side of a blowout for a change
8779378 i was recruited because im a woman im a palestinian im a muslim im disabled and
8779379 i wanted the guys to go in with the approach they were going to play so thats a different mindset i dont know whether one series or not would have made a difference
8779380 it wasnt like they jumped for joy i think they respected the decision and it went from there
8779381 the good thing is we played a ton of football last week that was the coachs decision and good bad or indifferent its time for san diego now
8779382 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8779383 the clinton family bill hillary and chelsea got stuck in one
8779384 there was no bomb threat at santa teresa high school officer enrique garcia said
8779385 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8779386 year after year the continued success of the mens final four demonstrates it is one of americas great events
8779387 the support from our corporate champions and corporate partners for the mens final four and all 88 ncaa championships is strong and growing
8779388 as far as we know right now its a shin contusion its painful but as far as we know that is all it is right now so were happy about that well figure it out tomorrow
8779389 the early indication is there was no broken bones but much further than that im not sure yet
8779390 i think well know more tomorrow for a young kid who has worked hard hopefully everything is fine
8779391 some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party the party itself has on its rolls men and women of great quality but the last eight years demonstrate that the special interests who have come to control the republican party are so powerful that serving them and serving the national well being are now irreconcilable choices
8779392 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8779393 the clinton family bill hillary and chelsea got stuck in one
8779394 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8779395 the clinton family bill hillary and chelsea got stuck in one
8779396 police attended and ascertained a female had been stabbed with a small knife to the lower leg
8779397 extensive enquiries were conducted on the night but the suspect was not located
8779398 arrangements have been made for adelaide police to interview her
8779399 this sort of behaviour on our roads given the high media profile given to traffic offences recently is beyond comprehension
8779400 there are very serious consequences to drink driving someone could be killed
8779401 these types of offenders are a danger to themselves and other road users
8779402 we then sought the assistance of the ses who conducted a more thorough search but still couldnt find him
8779403 the police chopper was utilised this morning wednesday to search scrub land around the whyalla area
8779404 there were no physical injuries reported he was just a little worked up and was conveyed to the whyalla hospital for assessment
8779405 local police rely on ses members in these sorts of situations on a regular basis
8779406 ive had a lot of experience with these kinds of campaigns and there is no formula for a successful campaign but advice i can give you is dont put all your eggs in one basket and you need to approach the issue on a number of levels
8779407 in that area it seems you guys have hit the ground running
8779408 the government is elected to represent you and if youre making life difficult for them youve got more of a chance
8779409 you need to target those who do have the power that is the state government and the local council
8779410 im very honoured that im recognised by the union generally theres not a lot of recognition for teachers
8779411 ian is thoroughly deserving of this award and the way in which hes led stuart high school in the last five years has been exemplary
8779412 maintaining the schools positive profile in the community and its professional culture will be a challenge for the incoming leader
8779413 what concerns me is a confrontational situation where the government and industry impose the development on the community its a very poor way to preserve the environment and a very poor way to resolve the dispute
8779414 the way i see it weve got a community here which isnt anti development a community whose livelihood depends on industrial development but they realise there are limits and destroying point lowly and the cuttlefish is too much
8779415 i think that is an important part of the story that whyalla is not a town afraid of industrial development but even they have a limit and this is where they draw the line
8779416 part of the reason weve come up is to get a sense is it possible to tease apart these two the desalination and the rest of it
8779417 pad will take total responsibility for security at government house so we have asked all police to handover to us
8779418 there are no longer any police inside and senior police will today meet to respond to this action
8779419 because of the over the top charges especially the charge of treason
8779420 you need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8779421 if you have faith the size of a mustard seed you will say to the mountain move mountain
8779422 the game of billiards has destroyed my naturally sweet disposition
8779423 the flowers the gorgeous mystic multi colored flowers are not the flowers of life but people yes people are the true flowers of life and it has been a most precious pleasure to have temporarily strolled in your garden
8779424 if it wasnt for erica i wouldnt know just how evil i am
8779425 meeting erica was a party by itself theres nothing like a meeting of the minds sometimes you feel more at home with someone youve never seen before than with people who have been in the background for years
8779426 i think i should be very careful with what i say lest folks get the idear were lesbos or something
8779427 you always succeed in making me laugh or cry and think and learn thank you for your blog its a treasure
8779428 youre such a delicate flower i want you to write the blurb for the dust jacket when i finally write my novel
8779429 thats all right erica you can talk dirty to me in kerrville
8779430 you used to be fun you now act like a fascist
8779431 i think someone oughta take ericas comments from all the blogs she visits and mash em together into a new blog
8779432 erica you possess formidable talent i am impressed yet slightly repulsed
8779433 i find myself wandering the blogosphere to read ericas comments almost as much as to read everyones posts really
8779434 oh my gawd what a cutie she is bright eyed and full of wonder i could just listen to that accent all day
8779435 oh erica it is always good to know that brooklyn is in the house
8779436 i like you just the way you are a dooshbag
8779437 girl you are slicker than cow patties on wet dew in the morning and you can play half rubber better than anyone
8779438 one of the sweetest most intelligent and perceptive ladies i have never met
8779439 erica has cornered the market on crap blogging in a highly disgusting but yet entertaining way
8779440 i can have a mason jar of grade a pure d buck goat pee especially delivered to the troll of your choice at any given time
8779441 erica has a heart two sizes too big for her may god bless her and keep her
8779442 omg i so totally rate right now erica has left anti nj words in the comments here on my blog
8779443 beating erica sherman at pool was a rare treat and i think perhaps people should know even at the expense of possibly coming off as a braggart for going on and on about beating this aforementioned individual at her own game
8779444 china julia child and yiddish how do these things go together why in a post by erica of course need you ask lol
8779445 i dont do memes and i dont do links i do do gratuitous sex you know my email
8779446 as you gaze into the mullet remember that the mullet also gazes into you
8779447 child i still love you i understand ive been where you are dont give up it wont be long and youll be home
8779448 we have a secret weapon we shall cease to be your enemy
8779449 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8779450 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8779451 worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management
8779452 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8779453 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8779454 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8779455 and today as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration even after we learned that iraq has a 79 billion surplus while were wallowing in deficits john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8779456 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
8779457 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8779458 we in the democratic party dont believe you have to change your values in order to cater to people of faith said dean mentioning that the party believes that all faiths have value
8779459 jews and muslims matter a lot he said singling those believers out in particular
8779460 when i was learning how to put my faith into action in honduras barack obama was doing the same thing on the streets of south side chicago
8779461 now is the time to let our faith guide us to action once again kaine said
8779462 let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey and especially the one who traveled the farthest a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours hillary rodham clinton
8779463 to president clinton who last night made the case for change as only he can make it
8779464 what is the name of sen obamas comprehensive early education plan
8779465 you stand out in our practice field and you watch all the guys yeah he moves differently than the rest of our guys
8779466 hes just one of those guys that has that knack
8779467 well star 12 to 15 and say these are the ones well peg when hes out there
8779468 they cant all be plays where hes heavily involved there have to be a couple where hes not
8779469 i felt like i could have done a lot more i guess im in pretty good shape
8779470 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country he said referencing the partys platform that calls for programs that would reduce the need for abortion
8779471 i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination he said
8779472 i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers the illinolis senator said
8779473 the republicans who never thought theyd pick up a democratic ballot but did a few minutes later fireworks began exploding over the heads of his supporters
8779474 i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8779475 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8779476 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8779477 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8779478 not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8779479 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8779480 have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8779481 thats why im here i have to be part of this its one of many things that will happen in the future that will make america even greater
8779482 we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
8779483 i was nervous i got some sleep last night but i kept tossing and turning
8779484 this is probably the race that will decide the whole season ive got to do my best
8779485 i tend to go out too fast coach and i were trying to make sure that i was relaxed throughout so i could pick it up as i went but i guess i relaxed too much
8779486 im sure it wouldve helped having a track season being my senior year and all but i trained hard over the summer so it wasnt much of a factor
8779487 we just need to keep on working harder because we can get better
8779488 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8779489 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt matter who became president
8779490 today we face the same choice we faced in 2000
8779491 barack obama had the experience and wisdom to oppose a popular war based on faulty premises
8779492 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in war in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8779493 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8779494 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy
8779495 so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8779496 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8779497 let me spell out exactly what that change would mean
8779498 a basic rule of sustaining a political party is that you do not eat your own family members if you do there will be no one around to support you when you need help
8779499 faux applause were in the state of colorado tonight no sign of them during pbs broadcast
8779500 in terms of an inspirational leader steve jobs is really the best ive ever met microsoft corp co chairman bill gates said in january 1998 when asked to name the ceos he most admired
8779501 hes got a belief in the excellence of products hes able to communicate that
8779502 an incomplete story referencing apple inc was inadvertently published by bloomberg news at 4 27 p m new york time today
8779503 the item was never meant for publication and has been retracted
8779504 the ruling should be required reading for the executives of every web 2 0 business that relies on user generated content
8779505 most company directors are blissfully unaware of the administrative or privileged passwords that their it guys have access to which allows them to see everything that is going on within the company these privileged identities which lie on hundreds of servers and applications very rarely get changed as it is often considered too much hassle
8779506 our advice is secure the most privileged data and routinely change and manage them so that if an employees contract is terminated whether sacked or made redundant they cant maliciously play havoc inside the network or vindictively steal data for competitive or financial gain

8779514 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8779515 i wish more of his ads had that tone but for tonight we appreciate it and will congratulate him next week on his nomination
8779516 the next phone to come out is going to kill the iphone
8779517 wow this sucks that it this awesome phone has this ugly red back thats a bad move by sprint what were they thinking
8779518 amyloid beta measurements in the brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well the cells are communicating with each other

8779520 there are more people here now we have 20 to 25 people the cameraman is still on the roof and theres a big generator for the equipment
8779521 weve having hot dogs im sure they have pork in them and burgers and salad and beer
8779522 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8779523 police in denver arrested an abc news producer today as he and a camera crew were attempting to take pictures on a public sidewalk of democratic senators and vip donors leaving a private meeting at the brown palace hotel
8779524 his time has come now i feel it in my bones and i pray to the lord that he will beat john mccain just as he beat hillary clinton hillary was a tough lady but i always knew it was his destiny to win
8779525 thanks to everyday americans who chose to make a difference millions of lives have been saved in the worlds poorest countries forty one million more children have been able to go to school three million more people living with aids have access to lifesaving medication
8779526 but theres still more to do in this election year please join the millions of americans from every party democrats republicans independents who are coming together as one we welcome your voice
8779527 the ad is designed to remind them during their political conventions that this is the time to come forward with more concrete plans
8779528 were not talking third world production costs i have a hard time figuring out how that could be a quarter million
8779529 its about 10 times what production should cost for a head on spot i could see paying 25 000 tops
8779530 this is just putting one guy in the studio and recording some voices
8779531 matt was in miami and couldnt leave because his wife was about to give birth the other voices were filmed in various places around the country michelle obama recorded her section in chicago and mrs mccains was somewhere else
8779532 we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth
8779533 live blog what did you think of the obama acceptance speech
8779534 barack obama is a passionate spokesman for the ideals of the democratic party
8779535 these times demand steady and experienced leadership the individual we select to serve as commander in chief and leader of the free world will have no time for on the job training he must be ready to lead on day one there is only one candidate for president who has the experience the judgment and the vision to lead our nation forward in the years ahead that is john mccain john mccains character has been forged in battle and proven in public service the american people know john mccain and they know he is a leader we can trust i am confident that when the votes are counted this november john mccain will be elected the next president of the united states

8779537 what the hell do you other people think youre writing
8779538 computers and networks finally offer us the ability to write and we do write with them everyone is a blogger now citizen bloggers and youtubers who believe we have now embraced a new personal democracy personal because we can sit safely at home with our laptops and type our way to freedom but writing is not the capability being offered us by these tools at all the capability is programming which almost none of us really know how to do we simply use the programs that have been made for us and enter our blog text in the appropriate box on the screen nothing against the strides made by citizen bloggers and journalists but big deal let them eat blog

8779546 i have a reasonable belief that there may be other victims
8779547 i cant get into details obviously but as the investigation unfolded in front of us after his arrest we have determined that there might be further victims out there and they may be apprehensive to come forward
8779548 i dont want to suggest at this time that i believe hes a serial predator however we want to rule out that theres anybody else out there that may have been affected by him
8779549 our government believes that the polar bear is an iconic symbol of canada
8779550 clearly we need to ensure that the polar bear does not become endangered or threatened in canada
8779551 shows that while there are many encouraging signs for most sub populations there are others that need help the time to act is now
8779552 i also want to be clear that a previous government had the opportunity to take action to protect the polar bear in 2005
8779553 at that time cosewic made the same ruling that the bear was an issue of special concern
8779554 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8779555 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8779556 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8779557 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8779558 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third

8779560 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8779561 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have

8779563 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8779564 for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
8779565 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8779566 americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meagre record of barack obama the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8779567 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8779568 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8779569 looks like theyre getting ready for the emperor to arrive dont you think
8779570 i think with the roman columns and the facade its perfect because the facade is for production purposes but theres not much behind it
8779571 a true regional company in chicago that looks clear eyed on our midwest with curiosity and empathy
8779572 the idea for sandhill began to develop several years ago as i looked around at the kinds of stories that were being celebrated in film and on stage and what i saw was a focus on the coasts
8779573 in the national media both journalistic and artistic there is largely an ignorance of the varied frustrating and expansive experience of the i was taught the value of family and friendships
8779574 our goal as a company is to explore and communicate these ideas in the theatrical world our company was formed out of a strong and undeniable bond that has continued to thrive with each new project and we want to continue this growth and exploration of the foundation we were all raised on the has played an intricate part in our careers and lives and sandhill theatre company only solidifies this
8779575 got so deep in debt he couldnt figure out what else to do

8779580 do not worry then saying what will we eat or what will we drink or what will we wear for clothing your heavenly father knows that you need all these things but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you
8779581 john mccain likes to say that hell follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8779582 5 4 3 2 1 and some would drop to the streets in a mock die in and the chant would resume
8779583 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8779584 they held in our favor on all of the issues
8779585 would have clear notice that violating the curfew provision in the permanent injunction would amount to a criminal offense
8779586 hes angry and ready for a fight he is innocent we will try this case it is nothing but a false accusation
8779587 after a very difficult 17 months i feel like i have finally been validated
8779588 i am relieved to find that even federal judges are not above the law and that sexual abuse in the workplace is never acceptable no matter the status of the offender
8779589 the suspect admitted that she had discussed the sexual acts that michael stratton would commit against the children and making the arrangements for michael stratton to meet her the week of aug 20 2008
8779590 i thought i could do something better i was trying to show off
8779591 these guys want to try a little more of everything
8779592 if you have a mobility impairment gravity is your enemy water skiing is a totally different experience
8779593 authorizes but does not require school districts and charter schools to offer
8779594 how we think about licenses is getting a bit more nuanced
8779595 eclipse is an important lively and healthy project with an enormous plug in and developer community that uses an otherwise duplicative license they arent interested in using the bsd or other open source licenses that are readily combinable with epl code
8779596 we have decided that after nearly 2 years of operation that it was time to add the epl and serve these open source developers
8779597 in that light our removal of the mpl from the site seemed a little absurd so our bad
8779598 were putting that option back up for new projects the groups that want to use the mpl to enable their additions extensions and more for firefox and other mozilla projects are legion and considering their recent summit represent a very healthy global collection of developers
8779599 it was difficult i wont tell you that its not because we had some doors shut in our face early
8779600 there were enough young people out there that when we sat down and told them what we expected this program to be and what the vision of this program was going to be that they were able to buy into this vision and they were able to see themselves
8779601 i think i was one of the later players to finally see the vision
8779602 i found it kind of hard to believe while being recruited in 2007 that a year from now that well be playing and i just see a patch of field and a track around it
8779603 i started looking into this conference and i started talking to coach steele and he described to me what the buildings are going to look like how its going to feel all the new incoming atmosphere
8779604 and he told me up front everybodys a freshman and everybodys going to be getting a fair shot and thats all i could ask for
8779605 at campbell steele told him you are kind of small but youre talented
8779606 it was a need to know more thing because the team was not playing for a year but at the same time if i went anywhere else im pretty sure i would have got redshirted and wouldnt play for a year anyway so thats what kind of equaled it out for me
8779607 weve all invested a lot of ourselves in this program
8779608 i have invested a lot of myself in this program in terms of building day by day of this program the small details that need to be taken care of to build a solid program that i felt would represent this university and stand the test of time
8779609 im going to obviously be nervous because we dont know yet where we are this will be the first litmus test of where we stand today because we can guess we can estimate
8779610 but we really dont know until after saturday what we have to do to move the program forward from the way that we handle it administratively as we get a large crowd here to the way we handle players on the football field to the way they handle things
8779611 but its conservatism thats been relatively consistent for the last six months
8779612 we see some parts of our business where we were probably a bit too aggressive and were modulating for that now
8779613 this is a very significant dynamic in the server market today that i dont think wall street has caught up with
8779614 its correct that dell has focused on enterprise and consumer will follow in their priorities thats the right thing for them to do
8779615 i just dont want to lose them thats the most important thing i know it was my mistake
8779616 the kids had all the house to run whatever they want
8779617 these next two games are very important to help us position ourselves to advance to the final stage
8779618 with the win against guatemala we have put ourselves in a good situation at the start of the semifinal round i was very pleased with the way our team stuck together in a difficult environment we need to have that same type of effort in the matches against cuba and trinidad amp tobago
8779619 the columbus game was another game where defensively i dont think we were quite there
8779620 we didnt have the energy or the commitment level that ive seen out of this group for a long time we started off that game like we had already played 45 minutes before the whistle blew i was really disappointed in our guys commitment level in the first half and against a team like columbus which is a very good team right now they punished us
8779621 in the end 3 0 is a poor reflection of the sort of effort and determination we brought to the game
8779622 but in this game you dont always get what you deserve so we will lick our wounds
8779623 kenaikan rupiah yang terjadi beberapa hari lalu memicu pelaku pasar mencari untung dengan melepas mata uang indonesia di pasar domestik
8779624 jadi penurunan rupiah saat ini dinilai wajar selain aksi beli dollar as oleh pelaku lokal mengikuti pelaku asing membeli mata uang itu juga karena rupiah telah mengalami kenaikan yang cukup berarti
8779625 penurunan harga minyak mentah dunia tidak berlangsung lama yang kembali menguat hingga mencapai angka 117 dollar as yang mendorong pelaku pasar melepas dollar as dan membeli rupiah namun pada level itu rupiah kembali terkoreksi
8779626 eines der gr ten geschenke unserer demokratie ist es dass wir alle vier jahre einen richtungswechsel einleiten k nnen
8779627 die frage die sich stellt ist einfach werden wir diese gelegenheit f r einen wandel ergreifen
8779628 resolutionen des sicherheitsrats k nnen nicht durch milit raktionen umgeschrieben werden
8779629 aufh ren andere f r die aggression verantwortlich zu machen die es gegen ber einem nachbarland gezeigt hat
8779630 es gibt da noch nichts anzuk ndigen aber ich wei dass das diskutiert wird
8779631 kalau pelebaran jalan ini tidak cepat rampung bisa bisa arus mudik macet total
8779632 corporate cartographers are demolishing thousands of years of history not to mention britains remarkable geography at a stroke by not including them on maps which millions of us now use every day
8779633 were in real danger of losing what makes maps so unique giving us a feel for a place even if weve never been there
8779634 but its not just google its nokia microsoft maps on satellite navigation tools its diluting the quality of the graphic image that we call a map
8779635 internet maps can now be personalised allowing people to include landmarks and information that is of interest to them
8779636 anyone can create their own maps or use experiences to collaborate with others in charting their local knowledge
8779637 these traditional landmarks are still on the map but people need to search for them interactive maps will display precisely the information people want when they want it
8779638 difficult to act against teachers in racial abuse cases say police
8779639 it would be difficult to charge a teacher suspected of racially abusing a student unless there is strong supporting evidence and witnesses who are willing to testify in court
8779640 on nov 16 last year a male teacher sent an open apology letter endorsed by the senior assistant of the school for his actions against a student and promised to change his behaviour
8779641 however because he was let off lightly he did not change his ways and this had resulted in a police report being lodged against him on feb 29 for abusing another indian student
8779642 most people do not have an easy way to manage the vast resources of the web to simplify their task at hand for the most part they are left trundling between web sites performing common tasks resulting in frustration and wasted time
8779643 for me the web is a little bit siloed for a lot of users
8779644 there are all of these actions you normally take but you have to go all over the web to do them even something as simple as seeing something online and wanting to send it to yourself or someone else as an sms short message service right now thats a pretty painful experience lots of clicking lots of trundling
8779645 we have the rudimentary systems of structured natural language commands you can select something and ubiq command the software to translate this to french or e mail it to jono in both cases ubiquity is smart enough to realize what this and it refers to as well as knowing who jono is by talking with my web mails contact list
8779646 its also smart enough to be able to understand commands like map chicago comics and yelp tapas near sf and give you rich previews and search results to get you where you want to be quickly even better both of those commands let you insert results directly into say an e mail youre writing so that you never have to interrupt your chain of thought
8779647 its not yet there but it is targeted for everyone to be able to use it right now ubiquity is a 0 1 alpha prototype experiment that isnt ready for everyone
8779648 in 0 2 and on the focus there is getting the community to innovate from the edges to start making interfaces that work well for the general population that might be by being put in the awesome bar the developer of the awesome bar started looking at this

8779650 unfortunately these hit man e mail scams are still circulating and evolving throughout the internet

8779652 im excited about how this release balances our goals of providing a great experience to those who have genuine windows and at the same time creating a compelling experience for those who have non genuine copies to get genuine windows
8779653 as usual i welcome your feedback about this latest release and the program overall
8779654 innovation is critical to the uks future prosperity our quality of life and future job prospects
8779655 innovative businesses have responded by adapting their business models to meet customer expectations
8779656 once he was able to access the computers mckinnon installed a remote administration tool a number of hacker tools copied password files and other files deleted a number of user accounts and deleted critical system files
8779657 as a private tutor i have three students that use einsteinprep learning strengths are different for each student but the individual reporting tool helped me monitor and separately keep track of the work of each student so i can see who need help the most and then focus my attention on them our school district cant even figure out why students are struggling let alone develop an individual learning program for each child i definitely recommend einsteinprep

8779660 they will have more than 85 000 people perhaps more than 90 000 people in this stadium by the time barack obama speaks
8779661 there is a concern that the obama campaign may have issued as many as 20 000 more tickets for this event
8779662 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
8779663 because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
8779664 america under bush is hell on earth i will make it heaven
8779665 but for all your devilish tricks weve been there before
8779666 its not good enough weve worked damn hard to be hated and its tough at the top let me tell ya
8779667 we even went so far as to hire the guy out of bros to head up our broadband tv campaign sure he hasnt aged well but people loathe those ads or they used to now theyre all caught up hating you just because you keep under delivering
8779668 it looks like a really horribly painful pin you should have it taken out thank god you were so on top of this

8779670 the minor iphone security issue which surfaced this week is fixed in a software update which will be released in september
8779671 the big difference is that the new system has a lot more memory so what happened yesterday could never happen again
8779672 resulted in the wrong configuration data being loaded onto the switch
8779673 those computers were very old and running a language that only a few people left alive knew about
8779674 we can confirm that on 21 august 2008 three separate attempts were made via a single logon id to access the same data from a single hotel
8779675 the hotel in question is the 107 room best western hotel am schloss kopenick in berlin germany where a trojan horse virus was detected by the hotels antivirus software
8779676 we can also confirm that we have been able to narrow down the number of customers affected by this breach to 10
8779677 we are currently contacting those customers and offering assistance as needed
8779678 purges reservations data within seven days of guest departure thereby limiting potential data exposure
8779679 we got the warning from the antivirus software and after that we turned off the systems and changed the systems
8779680 we cut off our internet connection informed it and turned everything off immediately i dont know the details of the virus it was only 10 people who were affected the clients who were hacked have been informed
8779681 what i found was on one of the top underground forums for the rbn trading network
8779682 there was an indian hacker selling a log in to best westerns systems with a screenshot saying the log in can get access to credit card numbers and card verification codes
8779683 they are two teams who are both on the rise and they will provide a good measure of where we are at in our own development
8779684 my decision to play here this week has been taken in many different ways
8779685 this was a personal decision to be here and a decision which really after missing the cut last week didnt leave me many other options
8779686 i need to try and play well this week so i can one play 15 events on the pga tour and two get into next week which is very important to try and get into the tour championship
8779687 i spent a couple of days thinking about whether i should go back to gleneagles
8779688 at one stage i had changed all six flights to fly back i then slept on it and woke up at 4 00 in the morning and took another look and i really felt like this was my best chance
8779689 was it the right decision im not sure you know it might have been a mistake but ive taken a personal decision and im not there im here and i have to stick by that
8779690 i have to take confidence out of my second place finish at the open four tournaments ago
8779691 its not as if it was four months ago or 10 months ago
8779692 if you look at my statistics over the last 12 months im 70 points in the world rankings ahead of paul casey and darren clarke ive played very well this season

8779698 would people really rather have mr 894 out of 899 than
8779699 i didnt feel nervous or jittery before the game i tried not to let any of that get to me
8779700 i just saw open field and went i knew i stumbled once or twice but i never looked back i just went for the endzone
8779701 this was such a good test for us and we answered so many questions tonight
8779702 i was really pleased with mata and he defeinitely answered a lot of questions for us tonight
8779703 he is one of the best in the area and we designed our whole defensive plan around what we knew he could do and we are very happy it worked
8779704 its four preseason games one of those things you just have to deal with
8779705 for the players especially the ones that have played year in and year out its obviously more difficult for them we all know that its a necessary evil and we have no problem doing it
8779706 weve got some difficult decisions to make on about 10 players
8779707 for instance if we keep 10 defensive linemen we might keep nine defensive backs if we keep 10 defensive backs we might keep nine defensive linemen
8779708 depth at linebacker is a concern because of injuries two of them rookie xavier adibi and veteran chaun thompson were non existent in preseason
8779709 even as stewart shredded reporters for in his estimation getting too cozy with and used by political candidates he readily admitted that candidates flock to his show to attract his much sought after younger audience
8779710 neither party ever gets it quite right the balance between the taxed and the needy the suffering of one sort and the suffering of another you might say that in this both parties are equally cold and equally warm only to two different classes of citizens
8779711 john mccain has served his country with honor but his refusal to change course even in the face of the failed policies of bush cheney is reckless and will not keep us safe
8779712 conditions in the western iraqi province of anbar where a brutal insurgency once ruled have improved so dramatically that the united states is handing over responsibility for security in the sunni stronghold to iraq within days troops freed up in iraq could shift to afghanistan
8779713 a ceremony marking the anbar turnover is expected to be held monday several u s and iraqi officials said
8779714 you cant believe in change and cling onto the same old values
8779715 when you have no record to run on all you can do is campaign by scaring folks
8779716 if you have faith the size of a mustard seed you will say to the mountain move mountain and it will move
8779717 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8779718 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back

8779722 me alegro de que el psoe acabe con la especulaci n
8779723 me alegro de que por fin se resuelva una especulaci n que el psoe ha creado sin raz n ni justificaci n alguna
8779724 ni yo ni el bng hemos entrado en esa especulaci n y durante este tiempo nos hemos dedicado a trabajar y a dar la cara por las cuestiones que les importan realmente a los gallegos y a las gallegas
8779725 a trabajar en la direcci n que ya marc el bng para paliar los efectos de la crisis en galicia
8779726 eso es lo que los ciudadanos le demandan a su gobierno
8779727 la especulaci n con la fecha electoral es una cuesti n interna del psoe y ellos se lo explicar n a los ciudadanos
8779728 estos son momentos para estar cerca de la gente y me alegro de que se ponga fin a esta triste historia y nos pongamos a trabajar
8779729 yo ya he presentado una serie de medidas urgentes para paliar los efectos de la crisis econ mica
8779730 por qu los socialistas han trasladado a la sociedad un debate electoral interno que ha creado incertidumbre justo en el momento en que galicia menos lo necesita
8779731 el bng siempre ha defendido que se agote la legislatura para trabajar en los problemas que les afectan a los gallegos y gallegas

8779736 como hizo la ministra magdalena lvarez en su visita a las obras en lava en diciembre pasado era obligado visualizar tambi n el apoyo del lehendakari al proyecto
8779737 por si alguien ten a alguna duda ahora todos sabemos que eta est atacando de forma directa contra las obras
8779738 el proyecto va a seguir adelante con una estrecha colaboraci n entre los gobiernos central y vasco es imposible que la presi n de los violentos consiga retrasar o paralizar las obras
8779739 vamos a hacer el esfuerzo de seguridad que sea necesario
8779740 est acostumbrada a hacer frente a esa amenaza de eta y a sacar adelante proyectos en esta ocasi n as ser de nuevo

8779746 por parte de aquellos a los que hab a delatado
8779747 esa metodolog a era propia de los montoneros para los delatores
8779748 una orden de car cter inexcusable e insoslayable pormenorizada hasta en sus menores detalles que estaba destinada a prevenir cualquier tipo de reacci n inmediata por parte de potenciales opositores para consolidar a la junta en el ejercicio del poder pol tico de la naci n
8779749 la argentina ostenta el dudoso m rito de ser el primer pa s en la historia que juzga a sus soldados victoriosos que lucharon y vencieron por orden y para sus compatriotas
8779750 la argentina padeci una tiran a que implement un plan organizado de terror que ten a por objetivo eliminar al que pensaba distinto de quienes ejerc an el poder bastaba con la simple disidencia de pensamiento no de acci n para ser v ctima del terrorismo genocida
8779751 estoy satisfecho con el fallo porque hicieron lugar a mi pedido para que se investiguen a cuatro testigos con lo cual se acredita que no hubo segundo secuestro tambi n estoy satisfecho por las condenas que se dictaron y porque bussi sigui siendo hoy mi mejor testigo al reconocer que la lista de detenidos en la que figuraba guillermo vargas aignasse se realiz en tucum n
8779752 c rcel com n para estos genocidas y sus c mplices
8779753 los peores de todos junto con camps que ya se muri eran los que pon an en pr ctica las peores torturas por eso no se puede ni escuchar lo que dicen los testigos
8779754 before the tournament i was not imagining it this way like it happened today
8779755 so i guess maybe now im going to think about like keep playing
8779756 i thought she was maybe nervous more than i was
8779757 when we get to clemson theyre like ok you dont like usc
8779758 why because thats like this you dont like the chicken whatever so thats how they teach us and then you start liking football too

8779767 by filling life with failure small and big you avoid making the biggest mistake of all the one of not living
8779768 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
8779769 we always worry a little bit but we think our arguments are pretty strong yahoo has made it very very clear theyre going to take the best parts of their network and ours and combine them
8779770 i think were lucky to have the most recognisable and largest icon in all of sport playing ours
8779771 if tiger was not around and i was able to be the no 1 player in the world id be making half as much money as i am now because of him
8779772 i am very thankful for the fact that hes in our sport and hes had the success and the charisma and the lure to attract corporate america as well as fans to the game were all fortunate
8779773 the game of golf suffers when hes not in the field
8779774 it was a fun tournament last year i loved the opportunity to have won the tournament but i also love the way it happened with the opportunity to play three rounds with tiger
8779775 the opportunity to have one of the best fields in golf for these fedexcup events and to be able to come out on top was a lot of fun
8779776 ive played the same way ive played throughout the year i just havent been scoring the way i would like
8779777 new normal in essence we have a new reality and a new vocabulary a vocabulary of terror we have mastered this new vocabulary as well as the necessary related geography of their lands lands about which we never dreamed we would need to know at least not to this level of detail
8779778 look what happened in bosnia and herzegovina see the brutality in kosovo afghanistan chechnya iraq palestine and now lebanon
8779779 moderate muslim political advisors and possibly some think tank experts
8779780 injustices are employed by the terror managers within the various organizations like al qaeda and the others to pollute and brainwash the minds of the muslim youth for the purpose of
8779781 fight slay and kill those who do not believe in allah nor in the last day judgement day nor do they prohibit what allah and his messenger have prohibited nor they follow the religion of truth the religion of islam out of those who have been given the book jews and christians until they pay the tax in acknowledgment of superiority and recognition that they are in a state of subjection to islam
8779782 worst among men in enmity to the believers muslims wilt thou find the jews and pagans
8779783 o ye who believe muslims take not my enemies and yours as friends offering them love
8779784 those who reject islam among the people of the book jews and christians and among the polytheists all other religions will be in hell fire to dwell in there for ever and they are the worst of creatures
8779785 o ye who believe go ahead and take the jews and the christians as your friends
8779786 google has so much cash its now competing head to head the worlds biggest telcos
8779787 this liberal would be all about socialize uh uh would be about annoying august 28 2008 22 58 et by and combating liberal media bias
8779788 demanded that the press not overly makes quips about or sneer at the chinese mens soccer team
8779789 brazilian ping pong is not among the top ones in the world but its in the leading position in the latin america region
8779790 i told our coaches dont worry about it just keep calling the game
8779791 i said lets just keep running the ball because if we might not see the ball if we throw it
8779792 fredie gave us what we expected he was here all year last year it was also good to see the young guys step up its always a question mark when youve never been out here before on a friday night but handy did a great job
8779793 we wanted to set the tone and keep it going through the whole season this is a new oak ridge and a new stadium
8779794 its something that took a long time to happen almost like an old polaroid film developing but here it is it happened officially last night and tonight it is crowned this achievement and its going to happen at a football field
8779795 cu profunda gratitudine si mare umilinta accept nominalizarea voastra la presedintia statelor unite
8779796 the sheer radicalism and extremism of the last eight years
8779797 the risks associated with antipsychotic use in patients with dementia generally outweigh the potential benefits and in this patient group use of antipsychotic drugs should be avoided whenever possible
8779798 we have seen a small improvement in consumer confidence in august but this should not be seen as a turnaround in core sentiment
8779799 the improvement could be down to a number of recent factors which are mostly of short term influence
8779800 the fears that i have expressed over the last six months have started to come to fruition
8779801 ive obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind
8779802 i hope that serb officials such as yourselves will recognize that mass extermination efforts are misguided and counterproductive the only effective approach is a sterilization and no kill policy combined with measures to teach and enforce responsible dog ownership once it is clear to citizens that if they do not control reproduction and population they will have to pay for the care and feeding of the offspring the incentives for responsible dog ownership and sterilization they will have strong incentives to cooperate
8779803 animal overpopulation problem in serbia and everywhere including in the united states is one very much more one of uneducated and irresponsible ownership rather than the fault of the animal s
8779804 the killing of all the animals in any one region be it a town village etc such as racha will always simply
8779805 points to be considered to reduce animal numbers and to also improve animal welfare conditions include

8779909 william of moerbeke translated at least forty eight treatises including seven on mathematics and mechanics by archimedes translated for the first time into latin grant 1974 39 41 minio paluello 1974 436 438 his aristotelian translations are truly impressive he was the first to translate aristotles biological works from greek into latin in translating the rest of aristotles natural philosophy moerbeke found it useful to revise expand and even complete some earlier translations including revisions of at least three treatises previously translated by james of venice in addition moerbeke translated greek commentaries on aristotles works from late antiquity thus he translated john philoponus commentary on the soul and simplicius commentary on the heavens one of the earliest beneficiaries of moerbekes translations was thomas aquinas
8779910 with moerbekes monumental contributions all of aristotles natural philosophy was available by the last quarter of the thirteenth century in translations from greek and arabic although many scientific works were translated from arabic to latin in the first half of the twelfth century by such translators as plato of tivoli adelard of bath robert of chester hermann of carinthia dominicus gundissalinus peter alfonso john of seville and others the earliest translations of aristotles works on natural philosophy appear to have occurred in spain in the latter half of the twelfth century by far the most prominent translator of aristotles works on natural philosophy was gerard of cremona c a d 1114 1187 the most prolific translator from arabic to latin of works on science medicine and natural philosophy
8779911 u ntil the end of the sixth century important contributions to natural philosophy were made in the byzantine empire by a number of commentators on the works of aristotle such as alexander of aphrodisias fl 2nd 3rd century a d themistius c a d 317 c 388 simplicius and most important of all the christian neo platonist john philoponus whose ideas were destined to have a large impact on both islamic and latin natural philosophy but the level of achievement was seriously affected in a d 529 when on religious grounds the emperor justinian ordered the closing of platos academy in athens forcing a number of philosophers to depart the byzantine empire and move to the east after that natural philosophy and science played a minor role in byzantine intellectual life this is surprising when we realize that as compared to their contemporary counterparts in islam and the latin west byzantine scholars were truly fortunate because their native language was greek they could read study and interpret without problems of translation all the works available in the greek language that had accumulated in the byzantine empire especially in constantinople since the fifth and fourth centuries b c indeed most of our greek manuscripts come from byzantium
8779912 it is a paradox of history that the civilizations of islam and western europe contributed significantly to the store of human knowledge using translated works and often lacking important earlier texts while the byzantines who had command of the greek language and easy access to the manuscript sources of their great greek predecessors failed to capitalize on their good fortune
8779913 al ghazali included the mathematical sciences within the class of philosophical sciences i e mathematics logic natural science theology or metaphysics politics and ethics and concluded that a student who studied these sciences would be infected with the evil and corruption of the philosophers few there are who devote themselves to this study without being stripped of religion and having the bridle of godly fear removed from their heads watt 1953 34 in his great philosophical work the incoherence of the philosophers al ghazali attacks ancient philosophy especially the views of aristotle he does so by describing and criticizing the ideas of al farabi and avicenna two of the most important islamic philosophical commentators on aristotle after criticizing their opinions on twenty philosophical problems including the eternality of the world that god knows only universals and not particulars and that bodies will not be resurrected after death al ghazali declares all these three theories are in violent opposition to islam to believe in them is to accuse the prophets of falsehood and to consider their teachings as a hypocritical misrepresentation designed to appeal to the masses and this is blatant blasphemy to which no muslim sect would subscribe al ghazali 1963 249
8779914 orthodox islam emerged victorious from the encounter with greek philosophy islam rejected the idea that one could attain truth with unaided human reason and settled for the unreflective comforts of the putatively superior truth of divine revelation wherever one decides to place the date of this victory of orthodox islam perhaps in the ninth century with the conversion of al ashari or in the eleventh century with the works of al ghazali it has been i believe an unmitigated disaster for all muslims indeed all mankind
8779915 o ne must go on jihad i e warlike razzias or raids at least once a year one may use a catapult against them non muslims when they are in a fortress even if among them are women and children one may set fire to them and or drown them if a person of the ahl al kitab people of the book is enslaved his marriage is automatically revoked one may cut down their trees one must destroy their useless books jihadists may take as booty whatever they decide they may steal as much food as they need
8779916 even so enlightened an author as ibn khaldun a d 1332 1406 was hostile to philosophy and philosophers on the basis of his great introduction to history muqaddimah ibn khaldun is regarded as the first historian to write a world history according to franz rosenthal the muqaddimah was indeed the first large scale attempt to analyze the group relationships that govern human political and social organization on the basis of environmental and psychological factors rosenthal 1973 321 despite his brilliance as an historian ibn khaldun included a chapter in the muqaddimah titled a refutation of philosophy the corruption of the students of philosophy ibn khaldun 1958 3 246 258 in this chapter ibn khaldun condemns the opinions of philosophers as wrong and proclaims to his fellow muslims that the problems of physics are of no importance for us in our religious affairs or our livelihoods therefore we must leave them alone ibn khaldun 1958 3 251 252 he regarded the study of logic as dangerous to the faithful unless they were deeply immersed in the quran and the muslim religious sciences to fortify themselves against its methods
8779917 the muslims desired to learn the sciences of the foreign nations they made them their own through translations they pressed them into the mold of their own views they peeled off these strange tongues and made them pass into their own idiom and surpassed the achievements of the non arabs in them the manuscripts in the non arabic languages were forgotten abandoned and scattered all the sciences came to exist in arabic the systematic works on them were written in arabic writing thus students of the sciences needed a knowledge of the meaning of arabic words and arabic writing they could dispense with all other languages because they had been wiped out and there was no longer any interest in them
8779918 following the translations in the early centuries of islam greek philosophy primarily aristotles received its strongest support from a number of individuals scattered about the islamic world as we have already mentioned al kindi al razi ibn sina and ibn rushd were among the greatest islamic philosophers all were persecuted to some extent case reveals important aspects of intellectual life in islam the first of the islamic commentators on aristotle al kindi was at first favorably received by two caliphs al mamun and al mutassim but his luck ran out with al mutawwakil the sunni caliph mentioned earlier according to pervez hoodbhoy it was not hard for the ulema religious scholars to convince the ruler that the philosopher had very dangerous beliefs mutawwakil soon ordered the confiscation of the scholars personal library but that was not enough the sixty year old muslim philosopher also received fifty lashes before a large crowd which had assembled observers who recorded the event say the crowd roared approval with each stroke hoodbhoy 1991 111 the other four scholars were also subjected to some degree of persecution and a number of them had to flee for their safety
8779919 after the 1240s and for the rest of the middle ages attacks on reason would have been regarded as bizarre and unacceptable
8779920 the madrasas had as their primary mission the teaching of the islamic religion and paid little attention to the foreign sciences which as we saw were comprised of the science and natural philosophy derived ultimately from the greeks the analytical subjects derived from the greeks certainly did not have equal status with religious and theological subjects indeed the foreign sciences played a rather marginal role in the madrasas which formed the core of islamic higher education only those subjects that illuminated the quran or the religious law were taught one such subject was logic which was found useful not only in semantics but was also regarded as helpful in avoiding simple errors of inference the primary function of the madrasas however was to preserve learning and defend orthodoxy mottahedeh 1985 91 in islam most theologians did not regard natural philosophy as a subject helpful to a better understanding of religion on the contrary it was usually viewed as a subject capable of subverting the islamic religion and therefore as potentially dangerous to the faith natural philosophy always remained a peripheral discipline in the lands of islam and was never institutionalized within the educational system as it was in latin christendom
8779921 it is important to point out that not only did university trained theologians fully accept and embrace the discipline of natural philosophy but many if not most of them were eager and active contributors to the literature of natural philosophy it is for that reason that it is wholly appropriate to call them theologian natural philosophers they were equally at home in both disciplines and were keen to import as much natural philosophy as they could into the resolution of theological problems while avoiding any temptations to theologize natural philosophy this explains why some medieval theologians can be equated with the best of the secular natural philosophers such as john buridan and albert of saxony some theologians such as albertus magnus and nicole oresme were clearly superior to them by their actions theologians in the west were full participants in the development and dissemination of natural philosophy they made it possible for the institutionalization of natural philosophy in the universities of the late middle ages and therefore its extensive dissemination nothing like this occurred in the byzantine empire or in islam
8779922 byzantines and muslims paid a heavy price for failing to separate church and state in both societies aristotles natural philosophy was regarded as potentially dangerous because it encompassed ideas and concepts that were hostile to both religions and because it was often felt that scholars who focused too much on natural philosophy would either neglect religion or come to regard it as inferior to natural philosophy islams failure to separate church and state nullified an institutional advantage it had over western christendom where the latter was organized as a centralized hierarchical religion with a single individual the pope holding ultimate power islam was a decentralized religion with no hierarchical structure what power there was derived from local religious leaders who drew on the support of their fellow muslims under these circumstances we might expect that freedom of inquiry and the cultivation of a vibrant sustained natural philosophy would have been more likely to occur within the decentralized muslim religion than within the highly centralized catholic church of western europe as we now know the reverse occurred the west developed a lively natural philosophy whereas in islam natural philosophy became a peripheral and suspect discipline whose study could even prove dangerous
8779923 we should also not underestimate the magnitude of the step taken when it was decided in part following ancient tradition to make the study of philosophy and all aspects of the natural world an official and public enterprise if this seems a mundane achievement it is due to our eurocentrism which forgets that the study of the natural sciences and philosophy was shunned in the islamic colleges of the middle east and that all such inquiries were undertaken in carefully guarded private settings likewise in china there were no autonomous institutions of learning independent of the official bureaucracy the ones that existed were completely at the mercy of the centralized state nor were philosophers given the liberty to define for themselves the realms of learning as occurred in the west
8779924 without the separation of church and state and the developments that proceeded as a consequence the west would not have produced a deeply rooted natural philosophy that was disseminated through europe by virtue of an extensive network of universities which laid the foundation for the great scientific advances made in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries advances that have continued to the present day
8779925 for a dispassionate examination of the educational backgrounds of major scientists from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century shows that the vast majority of them were in fact university educated as john gascoigne has shown something like 87 of the european scientists born between 1450 and 1650 who were thought worthy of inclusion in the dictionary of scientific biography were university educated more importantly a large proportion of this group was not only university educated but held career posts at a university for the period 1450 1650 this was 45 percent and for 1450 1550 it was 51 percent if one speaks of particular scientists then one must immediately acknowledge that copernicus galileo tycho brahe kepler and newton were all extraordinary products of the apparently procrustean and allegedly scholastic universities of europe in short sociological and historical accounts of the role of the university as an institutional locus for science and as an incubator of scientific thought and argument have been vastly understated
8779926 if spain had persisted as an islamic land into the later centuries say until the time of napoleon it would have retained all the ideological legal and institutional defects of islamic civilization a spain dominated by islamic law would have been unable to found new universities based on the european model of legally autonomous corporate governance as corporations do not exist in islamic law furthermore the islamic model of education rested on the absolute primacy of fiqh of legal studies and the standard of preserving the great traditions of the past this was symbolically reflected in the ijaza the personal authorization to transmit knowledge from the past given by a learned man a tradition quite different from the wests group administered certification through examination of demonstrated learning in the actual event the founding of spanish universities in the thirteenth century first in palencia 1208 9 valladolid salamanca 1227 8 and so on occurred in long established christian areas and the universities were modeled after the constitutions of paris and bologna
8779927 in short the european medievals had fashioned an image of man that was so imbued with reason and rationality that philosophical and theological speculation became breathtaking spheres of inquiry whose outcomes were far from predictable or orthodox to the consternation of all furthermore this theological and philosophical speculation was taking place within the citadels of western learning that is in the universities christian theology had indeed clothed man with a new set of methods and motivations but it had also attributed to him a new set of rational capacities that knew no bounds
8779928 the west in giving in to political correctness and in being corrupted by saudi and other arab money is ceasing to honor the original intent of the university
8779929 i really struggled and made too many unforced errors and my serve was not working really well
8779930 obviously its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8779931 no i think i deserve that position i won a grand slam and i was playing really well
8779932 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like number one probably not but i cant judge too much on that because i really havent had a chance to practice
8779933 this kind of loss i had today is just incentive to work harder to go back on the court and to keep working hard and practising and improving
8779934 today i didnt feel it and also the last match was good so im just happy to be back on track without pain now all i have to do is put some hard yards on the court and go back out there and work hard
8779935 im real proud of our kids the way they hung in there

8779937 mr roskis been talking to nfl teams and team owners about their development in california
8779938 they have knocked on our door but we have declined weve not had a meeting or discussion with mr roski all of our updates have come through the league our intention is to resolve the issue in minnesota but clearly theyre out proactively seeking a team
8779939 at this point zygi has no interest in moving the team or selling the team so its kind of a moot point he wants to resolve the issue in minnesota
8779940 the tolerance for it is not going to be there
8779941 i really dont feel like one it seems like ive been here long enough that i wouldnt be
8779942 i dont know anything about it im just trying to win every time i go out there
8779943 all that other stuff great it would be an honor but my focus is just to pitch well
8779944 and carlos gomez hes not a rookie but hes 22 years old delmon young is 22 to me those are all rookies too
8779945 some guys said hes a reliever but i liked the idea of first giving him the opportunity to start i knew he could get guys out of the pen because i saw him do it
8779946 but id like to see if he could develop the other pitches and he has a changeup and a breaking ball
8779947 yeah i am i would have been at peace either way but everything has a way of working itself out
8779948 right now i would guess they consider me a starter long term and thats a good thing
8779949 i hope we hit so many balls off the wall that they have to check 10 of them
8779950 ill be anxious to see how many times it happens its not many but its also pretty important that we get it right
