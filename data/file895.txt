8950001 cada estaci n de prepago cuesta unos 500 mil d lares 360 millones de pesos
8950002 el 51 de los pasajeros de transmilenio realiza un transbordo y el 6 realiza dos aunque los usuarios no caminan tanto para el cambio
8950003 ha habido una campa a de desprestigio del principal peri dico y un canal
8950004 sigue siendo visto como la mejor opci n para transportarse en la ciudad
8950005 estuve ac en marzo de 2007 y abril de 2008 y lo que vi ah a lo que hay ahora ha mejorado much simo
8950006 hoy el sistema funciona la frecuencia es buena las esperas no son como antes habl con la gente y me dicen que ha mejorado pero que falta
8950007 eran terribles estuve tres veces en santiago bajo ese sistema y no se soportaba

8950009 i have my youngest son pick numbers in the range of total entries this time he was half asleep but i managed to pry the winning numbers out of him those numbers translated into the following 13 winners
8950010 i would be able to run my fingers through my hair and it would be perfectly styled
8950011 i would like to have a spell that could cloak my desk and computer at work from everybody elses eyes but specially my managers so that i can spend the whole day reading blogs writing reviews and reading ebooks without worrying that someone will catch me in flagrante delicto
8950012 my wish would be that all the sick children in the world would get better and never be ill again and i dont mean the sniffles or the flu i mean the kids with things like cancer and aids and kidney failure i feel blessed every day that my kids are healthy and would love for every parent in the world to know that same peace of mind i am also married to one of those men who leave everything where its convenient for him so that would be wish 2
8950013 i love the calorie free food and clean house however i would also like to control time to stop it so i can get a breath and enjoy the moment i dont know about anyone else but i always want to enjoy the moment or i tell myself i should but never have time or make the time to do just that so if i could i would like to have tha ability to freeze time to catch my breath or enjoy the moment
8950014 the instant transport thing is very tempting and i have wished for that when i have been travelling
8950015 since world peace has been taken id like a smoothing spell it could go like this twist me knot me crinkle me nay when i wrinkle my nose this way every knot and twist in my day is oh so smoothly wiped away this would take care of age and bed head related morning maintenance routines laundry issues interpersonal communications traffic snarls and possibly that world peace thing too youd have to wear slip on shoes all the time and youd need a counteracting spell when you wanted kinky sex but other than that i think itd be useful
8950016 an insulated bubbled around my house to keep out all the noise i have in my neighborhood and it would also zap people who cross onto our property line my property is not the public park people
8950017 one that i havent seen that i totally wouldnt mind at all is a spell that would allow perfect communication
8950018 putting the story im writing on paper exactly as it is in my head
8950019 since i live far far away i cant visit any book signing or rt book fair i would love a spell that can help me go back and forth havng fun with my fav authors also it would be wonderful if i win all those awesome contests and comeback with loads of books and stuff
8950020 for myself id like extra time when i need it so i can get enough sleep get my house cleaned make dinner get 2 kids to 2 different activities at opposite ends of the city catch my train do my hair not be late for anything get all my work done and not have to stay late well you get the picture
8950021 if i had to pick a spell it would be to have my bills paid the stress would be gone and i could read and relax
8950022 at all hours of the day whenever i need a meal or a snack one will pop up
8950023 i think its pretty much the same as always in north carolina

8950083 because of the large deformation signals from the dike intrusion we needed to do some detailed detective work to prove the existence of this slow earthquake
8950084 we used state of the art insar satellite data to constrain the dike source and that allowed us to demonstrate the existence of the slow earthquake motions recorded by the gps stations on kilaueas flank
8950085 a dike intrusion could be seen with the seismic monitoring network the tiltmeters and the gps network but these slow earthquakes can only be seen with the gps network
8950086 these slow earthquakes are an interesting phenomenon that has only been studied within the last decade and were still trying to figure out how they fall into the bigger picture of earthquakes says cecily wolfe also an associate professor in higp and another co author
8950087 theyre definitely a part of the earthquakes cycle and trying to understand how they relate to other earthquakes and how they may be generated and triggered will give us greater insights into how predicable earthquakes are
8950088 our goal is to identify biomarkers that will help predict which patients will respond to therapy against insulin like growth factor
8950089 we have technology now to allow us to globally assess what igf is doing in breast cancer at the whole gene expression level
8950090 this is one of the first studies to do that we know that igf is bad in cancer but now we can globally understand it in a more comprehensive manner it could lead to finding biomarkers for patients response
8950091 we found that igf i is a major regulator of cell growth and cell survival
8950092 if you have something regulating dna repair you want that turned off
8950093 once patients are resistant to hormone treatment as with tamoxifen their treatment options are limited a treatment that inhibited receptors for igf might give them another option
8950094 other studies have suggested that there are differences between men and women in response to different antidepressants but the evidence has been conflicting
8950095 this study is large enough and we were able to control for enough complicating factors that we feel confident there is a true difference these results have clear implications for the clinical treatment of depression
8950096 classical communication has not done too badly with the detectors available now but now they are getting pushed to the limit as optical communications explodes single photon detectors are becoming more important
8950097 photon detection in general is a key enabling field of research
8950098 and it is improving all the time photon detection is used for quantum cryptography and computing as well as for metrology and telecommunications our experiment is one that shows how telecom wavelength photons can be converted into the regime of silicon detectors
8950099 this works well for some things but sometimes you want to be able to change the wavelength that is what we are working on
8950100 all upconversion schemes rely on mixing two lasers to generate a third with the desired wavelength by a nonlinear process
8950101 our practicality comes from the choice of components the precision comes from the choice of silicon detector the tunability comes from being able to tune one of these lasers that are initially mixed
8950102 f aster communication systems necessarily have to work with lower intensities fewer photons and it is here that the single photon detection technologies will be needed
8950103 this offers practicality and low cost the idea is that we keep simplicity but gain the advantage of tuning wavelengths
8950104 things are improving all the time in this area of study
8950105 having tunable photon detectors would be helpful for many experiments and applications we are taking advantage of being able to do this with a silicon detector what we have done offers a huge advantage for this type of approach
8950106 we found that if e2f3a is present the animals can develop normally through adulthood even when all the other genes are absent
8950107 if the e2f3a gene was doing something unique replacing it with one of the others should prevent development
8950108 we conclude from this that it is the genes location in the genome plus the timing and level of its activity that makes it so important during development
8950109 organisms above insects have multiple e2fs and these findings dont tell us what the others are doing
8950110 we surmise that the other genes are required for adult survival under the stressful conditions in the wild we are investigating that now

8950137 the concept of energy and the flow of that energy in the human body is the core of the current explosion in healing
8950138 we had a new employer being all powerful he provided what we needed if we kept close to him and performed his work well established on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves our little plans and designs more and more we became interested in seeing what we could contribute to life
8950139 the promise to top up arts funding looks good on paper and scores some political points but doesnt have any foundation in reality
8950140 the federal conservative government has increased funding to the arts in the past year from 3 2 billion to 3 4 billion
8950141 we believe that all government programs need to be reviewed to ensure that the public is being well served and these programs were not producing the results that canadians expect from their hard earned tax dollars

8950157 theres no doubt that alaskans right now are dealing in an atmosphere of distrust of government and industry
8950158 it is a governors prerogative a right to fill that cabinet with members whom she or he believes will do best for the people whom we are serving
8950159 so i look forward to any kind of investigation or questions being asked because ive got nothing to hide
8950160 hopefully though this wont be a distraction and get peoples minds off what has to be done in the grand scheme of things

8950169 consumers are certainly worried about the job and housing markets but lower gasoline prices have given them some tangible relief and we are seeing that relief expressed in the various consumer confidence figures

8950205 everything on this table 1 method make sure that sign is very large and be kind with the half of people who will ask anyway because they wont read the sign
8950206 even during the cold war regardless of political or any other circumstances the soviet union always fulfilled its contractual obligations to supply europe with energy and russia a responsible and reliable partner adheres to the same principle
8950207 we are doing everything we can so druzhba can keep working stably and supply european consumers with enough oil
8950208 lukoil is delivering the same amount of oil and oil products to western europe as before
8950209 gazprom is going to make 60 billion this year from exporting gas to europe its highly unlikely that on some kind of whim it would suddenly decide that it didnt want to do that
8950210 that a cut off of european supplies is someones stupid insinuation
8950211 there is no point in that kind of sanctions the west gets russian oil by sea one way or another
8950212 and what would russia do with the oil put it back in the ground and what about the fact that oil sales form the base of its currency inflows
8950213 it does seem like in the last 10 years we have been in drought conditions more than weve been out
8950214 monday is the day we are expecting to be pretty good
8950215 the moisture and the storms will be exiting the area and temperatures will be in the mid 80s with low humidity
8950216 the u s wants to expand nato into the black sea and as in iraq this will create a mess in our neighborhood leaving us to deal with the consequences once america eventually pulls out after all if russia is agitated it wont be the americans that will have to deal with them
8950217 the appeals chamber of the international criminal tribunal for rwanda ictr today overturned the convictions of tharcisse muvunyi for genocide
8950218 the appeals chamber also quashed the sentence of 25 years imprisonment
8950219 both parties have agreed that nobody should speak with the press until negotiation is concluded but we are asking for something more than the 27 5 per cent increase promised by the governors many non professional teachers are already aspiring to become professionals and this is because nobody wants to miss out of the increment once you are able to obtain a certificate from the college of education you become a professional if you are hardworking you can take sandwich courses in education at the university too
8950220 about 10 000 candidates applied for the recent teachers recruitment exercise in the state and so i dont think we lack teachers in this state in fact we have more than enough and they are mostly professionals
8950221 the basic qualification for teachers in the country is the nigerian certificate in education which every teacher must possess most of the teachers in this state have this basic qualification
8950222 the dual salary scale for professional and non professional teachers will spur non professionals to enroll for remedial programmes
8950223 if you didnt study a course with education bias you are not a teacher you are a mercenary and we dont want mercenaries in the profession go and obtain the necessary qualifications to become a professional teacher
8950224 you can never be as learned as those who were trained to practice that profession which means you will not always enjoy what they enjoy
8950225 the allowances that make up the 27 5 per cent increment are in four categories non professional and professional teachers alike will enjoy three categories of the allowances
8950226 however the allowance that gulps the greatest share of the increment is known as inducement allowance it is 15 per cent of the increment and will only be enjoyed by professional teachers
8950227 if this increment is implemented and reviewed in about a decade the teaching profession will be better
8950228 what does it take just the zeal and determination the union always prevails on the state government to allow teachers to go for the training during holidays most universities offer courses during vacation and teachers should seize this opportunity
8950229 we do not recruit non professional teachers for our primary schools but those in the secondary schools are allowed to take courses to qualify as professionals
8950230 of the 16 497 teachers in our junior and senior secondary schools only five per cent are non professionals

8950235 but ive seen my generation not do so good and college getting more expensive
8950236 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8950237 this country of ours has more wealth than any nation but thats not what makes us rich we have the most powerful military on earth but thats not what makes us strong our universities and our culture are the envy of the world but thats not what keeps the world coming to our shores instead it is that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
8950238 bill clinton truly amazing hillary clinton truly amazing obama biden truly amazing the united states of america truly amazing

8950241 most of us who survived that experience are now in our late 60s and 70s sadly we have died and are dying off at a greater rate than our non pow contemporaries we experienced injuries and malnutrition that are coming home to roost so i believe johns age and survival expectation are not good for being elected to serve as our president for 4 or more years
8950242 lack of experience and he goes out and picks a person who has been the governor of alaska for one year who the is sarah paulin or whatever the her name is

8950247 have political moves disturbed human rights efforts the answer is yes i felt throughout the mission that human rights issues have been secondary to other considerations
8950248 there is what i call a policing vacuum not least around tskhinvali and gori which makes it possible for thugs to roam the streets and use this disruption for bad purposes
8950249 there are refugees and displaced people on both sides in the tens of thousands
8950250 my main mission is for all displaced people to have the right to return to where they lived before the conflict
8950251 she brings an excitement on the part of the republican base the strong conservatives really like her and you have to activate the base he is also clearly trying to attract clinton supporters who want to see a female in the vps office on the down side there is no way in the world she passes the commander in chief test obama looks like the grand old man of american politics compared to palin and she makes it look like mccain and his daughter are running
8950252 the markets are not going to be happy with an obama presidency and mccain is not particularly loved by wall street either but if he picks sarah palin i think the conservatives are going to come out roaring in favor its going to be a positive influence on economic activity
8950253 shes a conservative pro life shes a republican obviously for drilling even in alaska and also off shore for increasing supply shes for alternative energies including nuclear power all of the above when it comes to increasing energy independence
8950254 one of the biggest problems the gop faces is being a good ol boy not sensitive to women here youve got a very vivacious young pretty experienced woman more experienced than barack obama i think shes going to bring a lot of disenfranchised clinton women to the gop
8950255 as someone else said you cant be further from washington than alaska so shes going to bring freshness youth and womens rights and womens opportunities right to the forefront meanwhile obama picked the standard guy joe biden
8950256 i thought he would do well to pick a woman on the ticket but i thought he would pick someone with more experience in the senate i dont think this has much market impact
8950257 the mehdi army was meant to protect the shiite community and to provide basic needs for shiites
8950258 theres no need for mehdi army to protect shiites if the government is protecting them

8950272 an enhanced and effective response to hiv in asia and the pacific which ensures equal access to services for all persons regardless of their age sexual orientation or gender
8950273 countries must clearly identify their priorities and effectively allocate resources if they expect to maintain a financially sustainable response to the hiv epidemics in the region
8950274 since the first cases of hiv surfaced in the late 1970s and early 80s there has been no cure for the hiv pandemic
8950275 it tells us that our efforts must go on further and further
8950276 some of the things that we have identified as contributing to the number of uninsured in texas with regards to health insurance are the high number of small businesses that are paying a relatively low wage that we have in the state our number of people getting employer coverage is less than in other states theres an economic climate in texas that is very much free enterprise which affects that other factors are that health care cost more here also we have overall lower household wages those are some of the factors that we looked at last year and they havent really changed
8950277 texas has had a number of initiatives started to address the problem of the uninsured theres a lot of activity a lot of legislative activity that is happening were finishing up two interim studies
8950278 one of them is more affordable options for small businesses to offer health insurance ways to make it easier for them including premium subsidies help to cover the cost to the business were also looking at that for individuals other sources of funds that might be used to cover their health insurance premiums weve also been involved the governors office and other state agencies in seeking a waiver from medicare that would allow qualified individuals to use funds from medicare to buy private health insurance
8950279 at least 2 more years of data are needed to best determine whether hg exposure has declined among women of childbearing age in the united states
8950280 since that time 1998 mercury emissions statewide have been reduced by about 70
8950281 declines over approximately the past decade for both species largemouth bass and great egret are on the order of 80

8950293 lowering or eliminating cotton import tariffs for china would result in a flood of u s cotton on the chinese market which would cause the loss of millions of jobs among chinese cotton growers
8950294 io tu e la mia car non si accettano no
8950295 ho messo via un p di illusioni che prima o poi basta cos
8950296 right now in a lab somewhere in the far east a worker is putting in 12 hour days making every effort possible to find the perfect polyester fiber that will substitute for your cotton
8950297 delivery of a quality product is essential otherwise you wont be in business
8950298 so the definition of value for your cotton is set by the foreign buyer
8950299 the rest of the world will gradually move away from hand harvesting but it will be a very slow process
8950300 once its bought and blended together the perception of the mills is that its all alike while we think in terms of bales the rest of the world thinks in terms of tons they get frustrated when they get cotton from the united states and color is all over the place and length varies widely we work hard to educate the international community on the u s cotton production system
8950301 and they complain bitterly about the quality of the cotton we deliver
8950302 so we have a big advantage there the no 1 controllable issue for american cotton is contamination wal mart bags bird nests tie downs etc
8950303 when american mills used 11 5 million bales of our cotton shipping logistics were pretty simple now cotton has to be at the port at a specific time for loading or it may miss its window
8950304 it seems every time we turn around theres a 400 to 600 increase for the typical 40 foot shipping container it costs 1 cent per pound to ship cotton from mumbai india to china it costs 7 cents per pound to ship from california to china thats a 6 cents per pound disadvantage for american cotton in shipping cost alone
8950305 its not just about fiber any more is it possible well one day grow cotton for its seed rather than fiber

8950310 they asked her how she felt playing second fiddle to me which i never felt she was she had the number one song in the country on hot 100 i didnt so she couldnt be playing second fiddle to me when i heard that i was upset like why would she ever go there keep my name out your mouth sweetie
8950311 we are probably reducing our water usage 50 percent to 60 percent of what we used to put out before we went to the monitoring system
8950312 we may start sooner and irrigate more often but were not using as much water instead of one long irrigation cycle during the week in the warmest part of the season we might go with two lighter irrigation cycles and still use less water
8950313 this technology is much more sophisticated than the neutron probe
8950314 we have constant access to soil moisture conditions which allows us to deliver water only when we need it the ability to record temperature data along with soil moisture is just another bonus
8950315 soil based monitoring systems that use capacitance sensors provide much better data than the neutron probe
8950316 many methods of soil moisture monitoring are effective for telling you how much to water but dont tell you when
8950317 to optimize plant health and the plants use of water and nutrients knowing when to water is just as critical as knowing how much with the capacitance sensors you receive accurate reliable visual data that can answer both questions
8950318 it gives you much more than just a snapshot of the situation
8950319 our soils have a very high shale content so they dont hold moisture very long its critical that we irrigate when the vines need the moisture but at the same time we dont want to waste water
8950320 soil moisture monitoring gives us the capability of 24 7 analysis
8950321 we put just enough water on without going beyond the permanent wilting point so we never put our vines into severe stress
8950322 you can walk out in a vineyard and look at the vines but you can never tell exactly whats happening with soil moisture at any given point unless you have this capability

8950354 hillary is an outstanding young scientist who is committed to the implementation of biological control
8950355 her dissertation research on host plant acceptance by the beetles introduced for control of invasive saltcedar is not only useful for that system but will lead to better understanding of the importance of post release evolution in biological control agent establishment she is highly motivated and a joy to work with
8950356 the beetle has shown great potential to control the weed in some release areas
8950357 it causes defoliation to the extent that it appears there will be a population level effect on tamarix stands
8950358 it seems there might be an increase in host plant acceptability of tamarix parviflora by the field population

8950426 i do believe that mccain has to do something to reshuffle the cards shake up the establishment do something unexpected and governor palin has all the kinds of things that mccain might see as a way to shake things up
8950427 i think it would be something similar to dan quayle dan quayle proved to be sort of an embarrassment as a campaigner being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough
8950428 and so i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left
8950429 i can tell you that i am going to a contender so that makes it a little easier to swallow
8950430 hes a veteran he knows its that time of the year hes fine

8950477 historians and the press have dropped the ball on architects and their value and importance to the life of the state
8950478 i think of architecture as more significant than painting and sculpting because it has the potential to reach more people in a much more public way i wanted to pay respect to one of the great designers of the space we inhabit
8950479 what made him exceptional was that he was a guy with a 6th grade education who graduated from carpentry building and contracting to architecture without any licensure or professional training
8950480 their entire pattern and design style owes a tremendous debt to gibson he built the first five buildings and he established an architectural style and language one that still continues
8950481 missoula was still a pretty rough place it had a few bad fires because the architecture was wood most of the city was made up of wood frames and log buildings there were very few brick and stone buildings
8950482 at that time 1880s 1890s missoula was a fully functioning town but it still had much of the character of your typical western town the mud streets wooden sidewalks bars and bordellos everywhere by the time a j gibson left there was electricity street cars automobiles paved roads sidewalks it was a different place
8950483 gibson decided to build a downtown office at the northeastern corner of higgins and broadway called cedar street it was to be the most important intersection of downtown missoula and it still is it had office spaces rentable space a general store and some boarding rooms he gambled on that location and it turned out to be a smart choice it gave him a front row seat
8950484 was that there were so many competing lists about what he had actually done and so much wrong information out there
8950485 we now know that there were at least 144 designs if not as many buildings thats amazing for a person who practiced architecture for just 20 years the drawings at the k ross toole archives are the definitive argument that there were more buildings designed here by gibson than at first thought his opus has expanded greatly this is as close to a definitive list as we can get right now the list is bound to change as people see more of gibsons documents and descriptions
8950486 it was quite ugly from the start there were accusations that damaged his reputation and there were issues with the execution of the building he had major problems with the materials eventually another supervisor was hired to complete the project which must have been demeaning for gibson
8950487 the project came in very late if you go to the courthouse today youll see 1908 over the doorway but the building actually opened its doors in 1910 in 1909 with the project in the middle of operation gibson retired
8950488 when he died in 1927 there was a clear knowledge that he was a brilliant important figure in the development of architecture and urbanism in the western part of the state but gibson didnt create a distinctive style or receive formal training as an architect so hes been on the outside
8950489 ive always had an interest for artists who are at the margins of movements
8950490 the people on the edges of movements figures like gibson interest me because they have certain freedoms that those who have been academically trained do not they see opportunities the pack doesnt often see
8950491 i want to see these buildings acknowledged celebrated and preserved as our legacy for the next generation
8950492 to help do so is my way of giving back to missoula its my way of giving the city back its own history
8950493 its become obvious that a catastrophe has to happen before the technology can move forward
8950494 if we have a substantial amount of food irradiated we will have substantial fewer illnesses
8950495 that doesnt mean anyone is going to use it but its a necessary first step
8950496 theres a whole lot of noise around the issue but the focus here is do we have technologies that lead to fewer sick people there is way too much food borne illness and people get sick and die if there are tools to help reduce those numbers we need to explore them
8950497 we do have some foods that are currently allowed to be irradiated such as wheat spices potatoes and onions
8950498 you dont want to use irradiation to treat bad food youve got to use it sensibly in combination with food manufacturing practices
8950499 i think realistically the better applications would be for irradiation of things like raw meats to inactivate e coli
8950500 an irradiated product is certainly safer than one that is not irradiated

8950545 at the root of the problem was americas audacious shift from income to asset based saving the us consumer led the charge with trend growth in real consumer demand hitting 3 5 per annum in real terms over the 14 year interval 1994 to 2007 the greatest buying binge over such a protracted period for any economy in modern history never mind a seemingly chronic shortfall of income generation with real disposable personal income growth averaging just 3 2 over the same period american consumers no longer felt they had to save the old fashioned way they drew down income based saving rates to zero for the first time since the great depression and why not after all they had uncovered the alchemy of a new asset based saving strategy first out of equities in the latter half of the 1990s and then out of housing in the first half of the current decade laxity in regulatory and supervisory oversight in conjunction with excessive monetary accommodation 1 led to an explosion of free and easy credit that turned out to be the icing on the cake

8950564 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy

8950567 de goedkoopste energiebron is nog altijd steenkool maar die produceert ook de meeste broeikasgassen
8950568 bovendien wordt in europa door het conflict tussen rusland en georgi gevreesd voor zijn gasbevoorrading daardoor wordt gas als een minder aantrekkelijke bron van elektriciteit beschouwd in dergelijke conflictsituaties is het aangewezen om op een compromis aan te sturen maar nu wordt er vooral gemikt op energieveiligheid

8950582 i am very disappointed that the post office have failed to show any imagination in seizing the opportunity of this exercise to propose new post office services
8950583 this is meant to be an area plan covering ayrshire inverclyde lanarkshire and renfrewshire yet a disproportionate number of proposed changes are in this constituency i have therefore made it very clear that any changes resulting from my submission should not lead to other post offices in ayr carrick amp cumnock being picked for closure

8950613 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8950614 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8950615 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8950616 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8950617 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8950618 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8950619 but lets hope that americans are going to address the problems that are bedeviling the country
8950620 how long can obamas campaign run on hate of bush most voters dont harbor and nurture that hate

8950630 all of them were generally lost in the fog and bang they go in
8950631 there were a lot of aircraft lost up there during the war and a lot of japanese aircraft as well
8950632 my father just literally died in my arms i notified all my kids and my lawyer notified dinas attorney lets see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral this will show her true colors thus not even a call but thats par for the course with dina she didnt even send a card or visit when he was sick

8950635 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8950636 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency in the united states
8950637 even during the cold war during the time of tough confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we have always avoided direct clashes between our civilians let alone our service men
8950638 we have serious reasons to believe that directly in the combat zone citizens of the united states were present
8950639 that united states citizens were present in the combat zone that means only one thing that they could be there only on the direct instruction of their leadership and if this is so then it means that american citizens are in the combat zone performing their duties and they can only do that following a direct order from their leader and not on their own initiative
8950640 its funny i keep hearing ashton kutcher say how he was responsible for trucker caps

8950647 they were pretty much hustled off they came right down the ramp jumped in some vans here and off they went
8950648 the age of all of them was no less than 80
8950649 it was a tough game we really had to work hard
8950650 they were extremely tough and well coached and we expect the same from maine
8950651 collectively we had that stat and thats definitely in the back of everyones mind still we get tired of hearing it after a while but we definitely have to remember it and thats one thing weve improved on over camp i think
8950652 were confident that were better because we have experience under our belt number one
8950653 number two were confident that we have a chance to improve because these guys have worked extremely hard in the off season and not just on getting stronger in the weight room bigger or faster theyve also worked extremely hard watching tape perfecting the different techniques that they need to play at their position those are areas right off the bat youd think automatically would make you get better
8950654 im hoping we can be a little bit more productive than we were last year certainly in all regards
8950655 the biggest thing were looking for is the guys to play with cohesion play clean not hurt ourselves we really did a lot to damage our chances to have good production last year we inflicted a lot of challenges upon ourselves
8950656 we need to execute better be more fundamentally sound and give ourselves a chance to have the kind of success that we hope were capable of i think we have the potential to be a good offense now weve got to grow into it and develop into it
8950657 were going to look for more out of our quarterbacks because i think theyre capable of more than a year ago both guys are
8950658 rick clearly is a lot more capable than he was a year ago
8950659 im not going to sit here and talk about the improvement of the offensive line
8950660 today is going to be the only way for everyone to see how much weve improved in the offseason and i think everyone is going to see how much we have improved i think weve done a great job over the offseason
8950661 its going to be a little inexperienced on the floor but were going to be the only place open
8950662 were just getting started the last week itll be all new
8950663 we have a liquor license we want to get out of the construction business for awhile and back into the restaurant business its to let people know were not dead in the ground

8950672 in the past sports fans have been forced to visit multiple sites in order to get all of the news they need this meant scouring one site for news and editorial another for rich media and video content and yet another for scores and stats fantasy gamers then also had to search for the latest insight from leading oddsmakers
8950673 with scorelinechannel com weve been able to combine all of this content in a one stop shop letting fans once again concentrate on the game
8950674 our goal from day one was to be the most informative most up to the minute and the most comprehensive sports resource available
8950675 to do this and to allow fans to interact via postup means that weve created a virtual living room for sports fans across the board while we are launching in time for the football season we also have spent a great deal of energy on building out features for everyone whether a fan follows the little leagues or the olympics surfing dog training fishing or extreme sports weve got the news and videos and were expecting to add additional features in every sports category before the end of the year

8950691 the market is conjuring up images of a replay of three years ago when katrina wreaked havoc on the refinery system in the gulf so were seeing a little spike from that
8950692 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8950693 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
8950694 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
8950695 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
8950696 u s oil demand is currently 1 6 million barrels a day lower than when katrina struck

8950745 yes we are killing somebody off i guess maybe i should have told the cast before the panel
8950746 its one of those things everyone says youve got to give the fans something they like to know new things at comic con its something weve been working on in the writers room and i was like well we could say this i hadnt seen the cast since we made our decision i saw the cast at 11 17am just minutes before they were to go on stage in the green room and theyre nervous enough as it is i was just like naaaw it will be worth the theatre you know
8950747 theyre in production doing their thing and were in production doing our thing ive spent time with terminator salvation director mcg weve talked about it weve had the theatrical people sit down and talk theres no real point to it its very complicated to do
8950748 i really believe that people are discerning enough to say this is the movie expression this is the tv expression and thats okay
8950749 the way the genre the way the franchises are sort of being branded out you end with a lot of different expressions of a franchise sometimes they are all in canon sometimes they are not and i think sometimes its more confusing for fans when people try to do back bends and make that happen
8950750 we have talked more about a way to dovetail off the marketing of the movie so more people can watch the show
8950751 process wise its very interesting because we dont go on the air till september 8 but we are shooting episode five we are writing episodes ten eleven and twelve right now and starting on monday we will be working on breaking episode thirteen
8950752 so were almost done with what we are being paid to do usually what they do is pay us to do another three scripts so they can keep the train going because if we stop working if they then want us to do it then well get completely screwed creatively ive always planned for 13 and hoped for 22 so i tried to find a really good organic place for 13 its sort of like halftime at the football game
8950753 were trying to figure out a very economical way to do some future stories i think that is fun stuff to do i know that we are doing more future stuff in the regular season we are doing at least one big dedicated future story last years dungeons amp dragons was a big future story and we are going to try to integrate it more in flashes throughout the season and we have some ideas of using those sets that theyre already building to do some stuff im not being vague were still writing them and were still working on them its going be future oriented and it will involve some crossover with the main cast thats in the regular show and hopefully lena headey or thomas dekker or i will direct episodes of it
8950754 shirley is a friend of mine she and my wife have known each other for ten years
8950755 so ive known shirley for years not well but off and on you know come over for a party or something like that so last year whenever id see her id say you should come on do the show she has such a cool presence she thought i was just joking then i called her this year and said we have this character are you interested in trying acting she had to audition she auditioned at warner bros and she auditioned at fox and she won the role fair and square as an actor
8950756 i am comfortable there as i would be anywhere else
8950757 people ask me this and i keep saying the fox executives are different guys theyre not the same guys
8950758 i am trying to imagine what the show would be like on nbc or cbs
8950759 to me its a fox show they do action they are an edgier place to be theyre not afraid to do disruptive television and marketing i cant imagine any other network would have done the hanging half naked cameron last year for their main marketing i was stunned that they did that
8950760 this year we want to win everything and were fully confident with the team we have
8950761 this is a newly formed group that has many good years ahead of it
8950762 we tried to bring in players but apart from rafael van der vaart it hasnt been possible that doesnt take away from the quality we showed here last year above all in the league where we were superior to the rest
8950763 were going into the season with high hopes but were conscious of the fact we must maintain things like our high level of play the atmosphere within the group and our humility
8950764 we have three important new players in joseba llorente ariel ibagaza and edm lson who have quickly integrated into the team and who will certainly play an important role for us
8950765 we must win the league for our fans this year we have a lot of quality and weve made some great signings but we know its not only quality that counts because last year we also had that there needs to be a lot of hard work and sacrifice
8950766 serve as a strong launchpad for our commercial search offer in europe and enhance our e commerce offering on msn
8950767 i wanted to work in italy and im glad inter gave me this chance
8950768 im sure serie a can be the top league in europe again
8950769 i think coach carlo ancelotti is very satisfied with our transfer dealings
8950770 this team have everything they need to win the scudetto or at least to be in contention until the very end of the season
8950771 honestly i dont think we are ready to win the scudetto
8950772 we are juventus and we have to aim for the top every season
8950773 it really hurts because i have tried i really tried to make things work he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side
8950774 he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it

8950789 he has a strategy to use all elements of our power to keep america safe
8950790 many people have been waiting for some sign that our country is ready for such change i think we might recognize it as a sign of such change if we saw millions of young people getting involved for the first time in the political process this election is actually not close at all among younger voters
8950791 we know theres no problem we cant solve when we stick together
8950792 in honor of the legacies of my father and of bobby kennedy let us give our nation a leader who has heard this clarion call and will help us achieve the change we still need barack obama

8950809 its important to note that the alberta medical association favors a total ban on cell phone use while driving hand held and hands free because research shows that hands free is not safer than hand held although bill 204 calls only for a ban on hand held devices we realize that sometimes change takes a while this is an important first step toward what we hope will be a full ban in the future

8950831 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
8950832 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
8950833 a little flat and not just because of its now required state of the union laundry list passages
8950834 the stupidity of it that somehow the idea that it is all over in northern ireland and there is no need for an envoy this of all things
8950835 its hard for me to fathom how anyone who knows anything about ireland would say this this is a signal that the u s government will detach if he obama wins the operative word is detachment
8950836 senator john mccain has selected alaska gov sarah palin to be his running mate according to us republican party sources
8950837 huge contrasts found between uk nations patients in the uks four nations have dramatically different experiences of the nhs
8950838 dr nick goodwin from the kings fund health think tank said the data should be interpreted with caution as it is collected differently in each area he also warned that the data did not take in to account existing health inequalities or the infrastructure in place before different policies were adopted by each government
8950839 mr robinson said he wanted an immediate executive meeting to deal with the issue before it becomes a matter for the courts
8950840 i dont think its involves any deep seated policy differences
8950841 im told of around 150 changes many involve references to northern ireland being changed to the north
8950842 basically once a document is passed by the executive then thats it it should be put out in that form
8950843 ultimately it could go to the courts but i think its more a case of symbolising the bad relations there are at the moment
8950844 i think people have become complacent and they have not understood what would happen if an economy starts to slow fast if firms start to close what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming and people with little experience of what is really going on
8950845 first minister to authorise grants despite wifes outspoken comments 80 000 to gay groups within the next seven months despite his wifes controversial views on homosexuality
8950846 the coalition on sexual orientation coso contributed to the 2007 and 2008 belfast gay pride parade awarding 5 750 and 5 000 from a fund of 230 000 which was awarded by the previous direct rule administration
8950847 what is needed from the devolved administration at stormont is a set of policies to take account of the different population profiles in the catholic and protestant communities to answer their different needs and stop following the outdated nio mindset of trying to pretend that everything here would be ok if everyone started behaving as if they lived in england
8950848 in january five north belfast protestant clergy wrote to the unionist oriented news letter complaining of the failure of the executive to tackle sectarianism they wrote we have poor inter community relationships effective apartheid in housing across our villages towns and cities community division exemplified in but not confined to the physical structures of peace walls slow pace of reconciliation sectarianism and fractured educational provision our real angst is that a suggested programme for government almost totally fails to acknowledge these profoundly difficult issues exist the response from the dup junior minister in ofmdfm mr donaldson was that power sharing was the shared interpretation which seemed to confuse politics as means with the ends it aimed to realise the draft programme for government had significantly replaced the language of a shared future with a better future inline with its prioritisation of the economy a much more convivial focus for members of the political class than the challenge of tackling the communal divisions in which they were so deeply implicated the revised pfg32 published by messrs paisley and mcguinness introduced the clumsy circumlocution of a shared and better future
8950849 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year where it will be discussed further with them so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well
8950850 in every society there is a substantial gap between the life expectancy of the children of the most affluent and privileged and those who are born into deprivation but some countries are better than others at closing the gap
8950851 a boy in the suburb of calton glasgow can expect to live 28 years less than one raised in lenzie a few miles away one born in hampstead london will live around 11 years longer than a boy from st pancras five stops away on the northern line of the underground
8950852 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
8950853 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
8950854 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
8950855 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
8950856 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour
8950857 he was on the right side in the civil war and because of him the right side won he changed the course of english history and changed it for the better
8950858 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
8950859 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
8950860 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
8950861 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
8950862 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
8950863 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
8950864 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8950865 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8950866 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
8950867 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages
8950868 eyesight of thousands to be saved after nice approves drug
8950869 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
8950870 clintons deputy national policy director jake sullivan outlined several irish policies that would be undertaken in a clinton white house come 2009 he said clinton would immediately appoint an american special envoy on ireland who would maintain an office in the white house and report directly to the president clinton would also firmly focus on economic development in northern ireland sullivan said and have her secretary of commerce and other government agencies get involved in developing strategies for ireland
8950871 in the observer alan ruddock begins his account with the morning of september 11 the day of the terrorist attack on the world trade centre in new york as the us special envoy to ireland richard haas was preparing for a meeting with sinn fein leader gerry adams
8950872 after a few minutes of talking about inching forward towards the peace process haas finally snapped
8950873 yet there were indications that no 10 had more room for manoeuvre than it realised in july 2005 the ira had finally agreed to decommission all its weapons at the last minute adams called no 10 to demand that some of the weapons not be destroyed so that the ira could arm itself against possible attacks from dissident members unless this was allowed he threatened decommissioning would not proceed the blair government conceded but wanted to check with dublin irish justice minister michael mcdowell refused to acquiesce in the backsliding despite enormous pressure powell told adams of the problem and adams gave way decommissioning took place as planned
8950874 anyone who omits one step in that sequence of values is falsifying the situation
8950875 i guess any educated user from te would not let these card hit the insane throttling temps
8950876 better follow up in person or it probably wont get done
8950877 the recently elected governor of alaska is 44 the mother of five and a former state champ in high school basketball she is truly mediagenic strongly pro life and full of spunk but can mccain say obama lacks experience but that sarah palin is ready to be a heartbeat away can he turn over dick cheneys office to someone whose only previous office was mayor of wasilla

8950895 a major contribution to our understanding of how much additional spending will be required
8950896 quibble over its treatment of cost shifting and private insurance premiums
8950897 a pretty basic tenet of conservative opinion that the problem of the uninsured is wildly exaggerated and that the bigger problem with health care is that many people have too much insurance
8950898 health care plan is very much a product of this thinking
8950899 the continued dissolution of the private employer run system but a strong performance by the public safety net
8950900 validates the ongoing reports of progress in massachusetts and confirms the urgent need for national reform
8950901 support a third way that preserves and expands private coverage by evolving beyond the traditional model of employer sponsored health insurance
8950902 a weakened economy and rising health care costs have led fewer americans to buy private insurance and more americans to turn to the government for safety net coverage

8950912 perhaps the most daring vice presidential pick in recent american history
8950913 sarah barracuda miss congeniality fire and nice a happily married mother of five who is still drop dead gorgeous and smart to boot but its mostly because shes been a crackerjack governor a strong fiscal conservative and a ferocious fighter of corruption especially in her own party
8950914 alaska gov sarah palin to meet with mccain vp search team
8950915 theres no reason in mccain waiting to see what the dems do first insofar as his picking palin as vp because no matter who obama picks palin is by far and i mean far the best pick for mccain and the gop especially in this time of gop woes
8950916 the triumph came in alaska where sarah palin a politician of eye popping integrity was elected governor
8950917 we are part of a symbiotic relationship with something which disguises itself as an extraterrestrial invasion so as not to alarm us
8950918 but is it not better to just study the data more deeply and look for clues
8950919 they relate to space time in ways for which we have at present no concepts
8950920 they cannot explain to us because we are not ready to understand
8950921 was incoherence i now have grave reservations about all physical details they supply
8950922 they are like people after an auto accident all they know is that something very serious has happened to them
8950923 they come out of it with a new perspective on humanity a religious perspective in general terms but all the details are contradictory and confusing
8950924 every man and woman who reaches the higher levels of spiritual and intellectual development
8950925 the attempt to destroy both dr reich and dr leary reached its most intense peak right after they reported their extraterrestrial contacts
8950926 i keep having very weird theories about what that means
8950927 for years ive been asking phylis and everybody else i know why does the gnosis always get busted every single time the energy is raised and large scale group illuminations are occurring the local branch of the inquisition kills it dead why why why
8950928 theres war in heaven the higher intelligences whoever they are arent all playing on the same team some of them are trying to encourage our evolution to higher levels and some of them want to keep us stuck just where we are
8950929 lodge of adepts that exists is regarded by some of the others as belonging to the black brotherhood of the evil path
8950930 or at least i didnt receive that aspect of it if it was higher intelligence to me it was just energy terrible energy my chest was sore for hours afterward i thought it would kill me but i was absolutely ecstatic and egoless at the peak of it if the chest pain werent so intense it would have been a totally positive experience
8950931 eleven sacred temples and a 330 foot long road ha ha lulz eleven amp 330 go figure
8950932 being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough
8950933 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
8950934 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
8950935 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
8950936 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
8950937 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
8950938 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
8950939 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
8950940 theres a pattern here every time canada is governed by a conservative government the economy stalls jobs are lost and deficits loom
8950941 stephen harper and jim flaherty continue to talk about how good the fundamentals are in canada in spite of the fact that by any economic definition canada is slumping even statistics canada admits that the struggling us economy is doing better than canadas
8950942 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8950943 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8950944 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8950945 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8950946 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8950947 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all
8950948 i always thought that if i was popular i must be doing something wrong
8950949 my grandfather once told me that there were two kinds of people those who do the work and those who take the credit he told me to try to be in the first group there was much less competition
8950950 i do not write about nice people i am not nice people
8950951 the future is made of the same stuff as the present
8950952 i am not soft it is better to be hard so that you can know what to do
8950953 the main dangers in this life are the people who want to change everything or nothing
8950954 con qu cara pueden ver a sus propios hijos son pobres como nosotros que tal se si vuelven rebeldes tambi n a ellos los van a asesinar violar torturar
8950955 pero para sentenciar a alguien el ministerio p blico no tiene que demostrar la probable responsabilidad sino tiene que demostrar la plena responsabilidad de los acusados
8950956 le pregunt por qu hab a tomado esta decisi n sobre la sentencia y dijo que ven a de all arriba porque l nada m s ten a cierto mando pero que no se deber a meterse m s para all sino que l ten a otros asuntos el de los magistrados era l que daba las rdenes

8950961 but to sentence someone the public prosecutor doesnt have to show probable responsibility he has to show solid proof of the responsibility of the defendants
8950962 i asked him why he had made that decision about the sentence and he said it came down from higher up he only had limited jurisdiction and shouldnt go any further but instead tend to other things the magistrate was the one who gave the orders
8950963 112 years in prison for our comrade ignacio del valle
8950964 seek out the solidarity of all national and international organizations to bring enrique pe a nieto to a political trial for his grievous human rights violations
8950965 from the grassroots our justice will see to it that pe a nieto governor of the state of mexico and politically responsible for the atenco operation will keep on running into women everywhere he goes who stand before him with a mirror that says torturer
8950966 on friday august 22 there was a discrete police presence all day long around the camp during the day there was an ase truck parked outside and constant patrols by truck and cars today august 23 around 2 00 a m the harassment continued with patrols even coming into the prison parking lot where were set up there were 3 truck and 2 ase patrol cars
8950967 the situation was very volatile and a clash was likely if we pushed on
8950968 we have given way to let them back into the government house to prevent a clash all security forces have left the government compound
8950969 we went there to demand responsibility from the police who ordered the beatings of protesters
8950970 we definitely wont leave the government house until we can topple samaks administration
8950971 he cannot stay on for long i am very sure of that you can see people coming more and more to join us
8950972 its a pilot project that we will then be able to install in other tourist locations that are at risk
8950973 while other countries are making efforts to protect and preserve this endangered species romania has about 60 percent of europes bear population
8950974 in the past a bear had to walk for miles to find food but today it can easily find it in places that are accessible
8950975 how the heck am i going to go to these photo sessions one is at the same time as the party if josh gets called to work
8950976 imam moussa al sadr was a major turning point for shiites in lebanon he moved them from isolation and marginalization to uprising
8950977 all shiite resistance groups and movements were triggered by imam slogans
8950978 i will not rest until there is no deprived person or a deprived area in lebanon

8951251 as canadians celebrate the 400th anniversary of the founding of quebec by samuel de champlain its fantastic that this remarkable discovery has come to light

8951253 as a representative from the quebec city region this important archaeological discovery is really important to the people of quebec especially at the time of quebecs 400th anniversary
8951254 its so exciting to see the past come to life in such a meaningful way for all canadians

8951256 while britains athletes may have won more medals than usual they must remember that they are tainted with the blood of tibetans falun gong practitioners and roman catholic priests
8951257 if you are looking for young heroes and role models forget the highly paid athletes who leave their consciences at passport control and consider the sacrifice being made by our soldiers in afghanistan and iraq
8951258 the mayors support for our athletes as they return from beijing has been totally undermined by one of his senior appointments mr coleman has gone out of his way to personally attack insult and disparage the remarkable achievements of the british team
8951259 while the rest of the country have seen how uplifting success at the olympics can be and have swung behind london 2012 mr colemans gross insult does nothing but undermine and embarrass the city
8951260 we should be giving our young athletes all the resources and support possible not rubbishing and going out of our way to put them down
8951261 we have commissioned kpmg to do a report on the equestrian shooting and basketball venues looking at whether the olympic experience and the legacy they will provide represents value for money
8951262 when you take the costs for these venues it seems like a lot of money to a lot of people
8951263 it is a sort of testing to destruction to see whether that spending can be justified

8951272 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8951273 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8951274 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8951275 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

8951282 in the honest belief that he needed to protect his son
8951283 it is beyond question that by acting in the way that he did mr khan killed mr brown unlawfully and whatever their differences the fact is that mr brown lost his life
8951284 that is a consequence for which mr khan must be punished with a significant custodial sentence
8951285 what became obvious as the evidence unfolded however is that from time to time despite denials to the contrary both mr brown and his son ashley barker were involved in acts of racial aggression towards members of mr khans family
8951286 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8951287 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

8951291 as the chairman of seanergy i am very proud that as of today we will be an operating company in this attractive shipping sector our strategic vision is to position seanergy among the shipping industry leaders and generate shareholder value for the long term
8951292 the support by our sponsors to make our business combination happen has been unprecedented and indicates tangibly their belief in the positive fundamentals of the dry bulk sector and their faith in seanergys management to deliver shareholder value for the long term
8951293 seanergy commences its operations at a time when the dry bulk sector enjoys strong fundamentals with robust demand and attractive freight rates our strong cash flow generation due to the attractive charter rates we have secured for our initial fleet enables us to support a dividend payout of 64 of our distributable cash flow while retaining the rest for growth given our moderate leverage access to bank financing and expected capital inflow from the conversion of warrants we believe that seanergy is strategically positioned to take advantage of the positive market environment

8951312 thats all ill be doing that wont be strange at all
8951313 ive spoken to the manager and ive no problem giving 100 for aston villa and that will be starting against liverpool on sunday
8951314 all i can do is give 100 for the club that is all the fans will want to see anyway i am sure that will be enough
8951315 it has been a long summer there was continuous speculation but i feel i am strong enough mentally and ill be fine with it all now
8951316 i always take things a season at a time this speculation happened at the end of last season and it has been decided that ill be staying at villa
8951317 ill take this season now concentrate on that and hopefully we can improve on last season
8951318 do i feel like ive been hung out to dry over what has happened that is what the football business is all about
8951319 i know for a fact that i havent been given the nod
8951320 im disgusted that people players media would think that nick faldo would be that unprofessional
8951321 its pathetic that people can even think thats the case
8951322 nicks a professional hes been a professional the last 30 years of his career and hes not going to start changing now
8951323 i told him basically that my decision is to stay here and play and i got the best answer i could have possibly got off a captain which was youve got to do whats right for you
8951324 i just hit the starter button and it didnt work
8951325 theres been a lot of speculation about the situation around the club as were all aware and maybe i needed to reassure people that actually whats written and whats reported about the club at the moment is not quite what the actual situation is
8951326 it was a case of just making shaun and his dad and his advisors aware that weve got great plans here its a huge project that were trying to get off the floor
8951327 this is the start of a great journey we hope
8951328 were trying to pursue other targets as well which will complement the good players that we already have here but the key to it was to get shaun back through the door and back where he belongs
8951329 shaun is certainly one of those players who benefits from playing week in week out
8951330 that will be a positive for him and he will benefit and i think possibly in the end england will benefit
8951331 thats our aim we want him back playing international football on a regular basis
8951332 new approach came out of the race fine but he was just too strong in the early part of the race
8951333 he was very fresh early and very rusty late and i said afterwards i needed to get him to settle again
8951334 he has started to do that in his work already and i think you will see a different horse next time
8951335 the irish champion stakes is still very much the plan at this stage

8951339 the jozi jobs section is being initiated to satisfy the desires of our readers who have on several occasions requested a segment like this inside the newspaper many of them are always searching for better and inspiring jobs
8951340 were continually looking at ways to provide a better service to our readers and as such we chose to partner with jobs co za as it is an established and very professionally run job portal we believe there will be excellent synergies in this relationship which will give further mileage to both partners equally

8951346 what better experience to kick start my journey than to have been given the opportunity to attend the 2nd experiential marketing summit not only is it a chance to expand my theoretical understanding of marketing it is also an opportunity to cross the threshold into what the industry is actually up to who is leading it forward and where it is headed in the future giving me a taste of all that awaits me following graduation

8951369 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8951370 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8951371 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

8951374 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8951375 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8951376 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8951377 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8951378 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8951379 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8951380 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8951381 this is not a green budget this is not a peoples budget this is a con trick budget that protects the rich and abandons the poor the government has bottled it on green taxes and failed to implement the necessary measures to cut child poverty
8951382 this was an opportunity to give whatever help possible to millions of stretched british families who are feeling the pinch and whose money just doesnt go as far as it used to instead we have a budget which gives only limited help to the poor but maintains special treatment for the rich
8951383 the piecemeal reforms that the chancellor is introducing to the chaotic tax credit system wont get the government anywhere near meeting its 2010 child poverty target the reality is that the governments approach has failed if we are to abolish child poverty for good we must not only increase income we must increase opportunity too these are the people most in need in our society yet after ten years and yet another budget they are still no nearer being given the true support they need
8951384 its a budget designed to fill a black hole masquerading as good for the environment green taxes should be revenue neutral they should not be treated as a wheeze to squeeze ever more money out of the british people but should instead be designed to encourage green behaviour and to cut the taxes of the most needy
8951385 but instead of a budget for the environment we have a budget driven by fiscal incompetence and political desperation why has alistair darling not had the guts to claw back the huge profits made by energy companies thanks to the emissions permits that the government has given them for free
8951386 4 5 million people still live in fuel poverty and the governments 2010 fuel poverty target has been conveniently forgotten by ministers trying to grab headlines by increasing the winter fuel payment for just one year will do nothing to help poor pensioners in the long run surely this is the time to compel all energy companies to introduce real fair social tariffs for all vulnerable people not just those on pre paid meters
8951387 the liberal democrat proposals will help families into homes that they can afford in communities that are sustainable
8951388 dead millionaires are at the heart of the tory core vote strategy
8951389 we will all need to work hard focus our collective efforts and get our messages out to voters
8951390 it is essential that children with particular needs are supported by teachers who have been trained to give them the specialist support they need
8951391 to abduction or kidnap which is illegal under international law
8951392 the great political story of our time is the story of the vast and growing army of people who look at the two main parties and say no thanks people who like me like you want something different
8951393 tired of a system that swings like a pendulum between two establishment parties tired of the same old politicians the same old fake choices the same old feeling that nothing ever changes but this isnt a story of indifference people do care about issues climate change poverty their local school or hospital there are marches and campaigns and petitions launched every day of the week people care they just dont care about politicians so this is the end of the line for politics as usual if we want a political system that works for the future we need to start again
8951394 first lets clean up politics scandals over pay and expenses have shattered confidence thousands of voters have seen their
8951395 second lets give people the say they deserve i hold town hall meetings up and down the country every couple of weeks where i answer any question on any topic and anyone can come along i say to gordon brown and david cameron do the same today im writing to invite them to join me at any one of the town hall meetings coming up not as a media stunt but a direct conversation with people no spin no hand picked audiences no planted questions
8951396 third lets design a new political system for the 21st century it shouldnt be hammered out in secret smoke filled rooms by the powers that be i want a citizens jury of 100 people to sit in a constitutional convention with all the political parties churches civil society groups and more to look across the board and redesign the way britain is governed i wrote to david cameron and gordon brown proposing such a convention just after christmas their replies were laughable dave suggested he and i gang up on gordon and gordon sent me six pages of legalistic waffle
8951397 its still the same the establishment parties will manipulate the system to get the power they want but theyll never change it they like having power and privilege sewn up between a few chums in the westminster bubble thats why they wont do whats needed and get the money out of politics they dont see were heading for the skids if we dont act britain will end up like america where political influence is all about cash thats why i want a universal 25 000 cap on donations a real cap on spending and yes an end to big union donations and an end to offshore finance from belize
8951398 if it means walking out of parliament when the big parties collude against us i say fine if it means boycotting banquets that celebrate our relationship with dodgy regimes like vince cable did or speaking up to expose corruption like chris davies did i say so be it if it means risking court and refusing to sign up for an identity card i say bring it on and you can expect more much more of that from me
8951399 our whole international political system and britains role within it is twisted and warped by powerful people determined to promote their own interests what better example is there than iraq if there is one thing this illegal war has taught us it is this that when others choose to ride their tanks over the top of international law our government must not roll over or join in
8951400 set priorities here in britain not in the pentagon no more nods and winks to the abuse of human rights no more secretive deals to host american missile systems on british soil no more neo con wars
8951401 under labour quite simply it isnt any of those things this is a government which identifies twenty major countries of concern for human rights abuses then exports record levels of arms to nineteen of them this is a government which cancels an investigation into corrupt arms sales to saudi then rolls out the red carpet for a state visit from its king this is a prime minister who refuses to speak up on human rights abuses in china then picks up his reward in the form of special trade deals for too long vested interests have triumphed over doing whats right and its got to stop
8951402 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8951403 it is to do with the continuation of that treatment into the very important job i was doing as the co ordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 olympics
8951404 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8951405 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8951406 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8951407 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8951408 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8951409 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8951410 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8951411 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8951412 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8951413 with both oil and gasoline inventories much lower than when katrina and rita hit the price consequences could be even worse this time
8951414 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 1 75 per litre
8951415 this just underscores the vulnerability of what has been the only region where production is growing in the united states to hurricanes
8951416 were only in the second or third inning of this seasons hurricane season
8951417 the sports hernia where i go online to get my laughs
8951418 the sports hernia does what good satire should it makes you laugh hardest at yourself
8951419 you could say were a little bored here so we decided to kick jays head around for a bit well a day
8951420 everything went very quickly an opportunity to play in england happened and i like the new challenge
8951421 hopefully ill be able to wear espanyols shirt again because thats something huge
8951422 the doors remain open i want to tell you see you soon
8951423 people from the club treated me well since the day i arrived sharing those three years has been a joy because i lived unforgettable moments
8951424 nice to be told what to do by one so young and one so inexperienced
8951425 is anyone else speaking to nick faldo no self praise is no praise
8951426 its a very difficult decision not as clear cut as it has been in previous years possibly but i am sure nick will make the right one
8951427 the ospreys are the leading region in welsh rugby its a forward thinking and ambitious set up that clearly has an exciting future and its fantastic that im going to be able to play a part in that over the next four years
8951428 its great to be a part of the ospreys squad working with guys likes these competing with them and learning from them can only make me a better player in the long run and help me towards nailing down the number three jersey with the ospreys and if i can do that then with wales as well this has to be my long term aim
8951429 its good news that cai has signed a long term contract as one of the best young props in the magners league he has a bright future ahead of him
8951430 props traditionally get better with age so at 24 he is still learning but he has the right attitude and commitment to hard work to have a real impact
8951431 i dont have a statement but i do have questions as an innocent man where do i go to get back the four years the department of justice stole from me as a taxpayer where do i go to get back the millions of dollars the fbi and justice department wasted persecuting me and as a citizen what must i do to have a justice department free of partisan corruption so profound it has turned on those it is sworn to protect
8951432 i am glad an innocent man has been vindicated steve kurtz stared in the face of the federal government and a twenty year prison term and never flinched because he believes in his work and his actions were those of a completely innocent man clients like him are a blessing and although i have had many important victories this one stands at the top of the list
8951433 this ruling is the best possible ending to a horrible ordeal but we are mindful of numerous cases still pending and the grave injustices perpetrated by the bush administration following 9 11 this case was part of a larger picture in which law enforcement was given expanded powers in this instance the bush administration was unsuccessful in its attempt to erode americans constitutional rights
8951434 the government has unlimited resources to bring and prosecute these kinds of charges but the accused often dont have any resources to defend themselves this victory could never have happened without the activism of thousands of people supporters protested vocally opposed the prosecution and refused to let it go on in silence and without their efforts at fundraising kurtz and ferrell would not have been able to defend themselves from these false accusations
8951435 i can understand mido will want to play hell be causing me a headache in terms of selection
8951436 at the start of the season it was easy because he hadnt had pre season matches but now he is getting up to full fitness and scoring goals that gives me a problem
8951437 he has had a big impact from the bench and i think he is pushing hard to get in that starting line up
8951438 the villa game has come and gone it was an important win and a great day for the club and it showed the character we have got within the group of players
8951439 but we move on now because weve got to prepare for a very tough game at middlesbrough on saturday
8951440 they were unfortunate to lose at liverpool and the reports im getting is they are a much better team than they were last year
8951441 i want a big farewell fight to leave a lasting impression all over the world with a huge event fighting there would be a dream come true and thats why i dont rule out the possibility of having another fight next year
8951442 he must be talking about me who else would he fight at the azteca it aint gonna be
8951443 i love my c t was a standout and both a badge and t shirt were produced
8951444 speak up and women are tagged troublemakers keep quiet and their needs arenever registered and nothing changes ithas struck us that this stifling of womens voices for stepping out of line is becoming aseffective at our end of the world as putting women in burkas has become at the other to call yourself a feminist has become very risky
8951445 while the professional and legal positions of women have improved enormously in the last half century
8951446 socially and domestically weve barely progressed at all we are still judged first on how well we conform to gendered norms that were already looking tattered in 1955
8951447 we continually hear that feminism is a thing of the past
8951448 all around us are poster girls for feminism gone wrong the deluded pole dancer a victim of false feminist empowerment the thirtysomething career woman who will miss out on babies because feminism told her she could have it all the heiress without panties the actress with an eating disorder the pop star with a shaved head the oppressed muslim woman whom feminism ignored and abandoned
8951449 less and less can it be mentioned without people reacting negatively
8951450 used to sell everything from pubic hair removal creams to thousand dollar shoes
8951451 the unfortunate truth is that feminists have also wasted a lot of time blaming each other fighting over priorities and emphases over whos got it right and whos got it wrong so perhaps its time for a new inclusiveness recognising that there can be many different feminist issues and feminist priorities all co existing
8951452 when women had little choice but to become full time mothers and housewives the stress of negotiating the minefield of career and motherhood was non existent entrenched gender roles meant fewer couples fought over who would care for the kids cook dinner and take care of the family finances
8951453 make me feel queasy more than that the idea of marriage itself makes me uncomfortable
8951454 address my husband as if you poor thing ive started feeling a little bit frustrated by it but i wouldnt go so far as to get divorced
8951455 more or less normal children well they are teenagers and apparently durable marriages
8951456 the pervasive idea that women will never be able to effectively combine interests outside the home or a job with marriage a social life and parenting is a furphy
8951457 mothers in particular are charting new territory juggling parenting and housekeeping with paid work we are creating a new way to be married a new look workplace and a new and we believe much healthier way for men and women to relate to one another romantically professionally and as fellow human beings
8951458 objecting to the idea that women are here solely for mens pleasure
8951459 we need to drop this view that its just a few pesky mothers who want special treatment
8951460 everybody has a family and when the majority of people are struggling with this balance theres really something out of whack
8951461 the amount of crap that is out there is astounding
8951462 but i think things are starting to heat up there is some kind of momentum and that is long overdue
8951463 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8951464 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8951465 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8951466 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8951467 the fundamental principles in carrying out our news business are these to get the news to publish it instantly whether bull or bear no operator controls or can control our news we are proud of the confidence reposed in our work we mean to make it better and we mean to have the news always honest intelligent and unprejudiced
8951468 what i want you to remember in respect to wisdom is that more and more we are called upon not only to be the gatherers of facts but to set forth intelligence regarding those facts we will be called upon also more and more in the future to give the wisdom in relation to those facts and the presentation of that intelligence
8951469 any interference or even hint of interference would break the trust that exists between the paper and its readers something i am unwilling to countenance apart from breaching the publics trust it would simply be bad business
8951470 generations of wall street journal editors and reporters have had a covenant with our readers to provide fair and accurate reporting on the many subjects we cover every day
8951471 we are grateful to the bancroft and murdoch families for their agreement endorsing the principle of editorial independence that has long been the hallmark of dow jones and the wall street journal we recognize that the best assurances of independence are reporters and editors committed to following news where the facts lead and to expressing opinions based on consistent principles we want to assure our readers that we will remain as committed to those values under new ownership as we have been for more than a century

8951477 and with one mission under his belt he has the skills and experience which will make him an extremely valuable member of the battle group

8951510 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8951511 this country of ours has more wealth than any nation but thats not what makes us rich we have the most powerful military on earth but thats not what makes us strong our universities and our culture are the envy of the world but thats not what keeps the world coming to our shores instead it is that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend

8951515 most of us who survived that experience are now in our late 60s and 70s sadly we have died and are dying off at a greater rate than our non pow contemporaries we experienced injuries and malnutrition that are coming home to roost so i believe johns age and survival expectation are not good for being elected to serve as our president for 4 or more years

8951521 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me

8951524 we came to see the initial appearance of the biggest butcher of the 20th century in the balkans

8951540 since we started with relay we have been really affected by cancer
8951541 i had six friends die of cancer in less than four years all under the age of 48 my dear friend died in 2004 i miss her terribly and i fight because of her i dont think i will ever give up my fight to find a cure after losing her to hodgkins lymphoma at the age of 37
8951542 i believe my sister in law is still with us today because of our efforts in the past to fund research to help with her treatment plan
8951543 we cant expect the american people to jump from capitalism to communism but we can assist their elected leaders in giving them you

8951546 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8951547 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8951548 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8951549 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8951550 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8951551 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8951552 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8951553 set to usher in a new era of council housing
8951554 what began as a fall in prices is fast becoming a housing crash the governments public dithering over whether to offer a stamp duty holiday is making a bad problem worse
8951555 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8951556 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8951557 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors

8951559 john mccains central and best argument in this campaign is that barack obama simply lacks the experience to be president of the united states
8951560 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

8951562 to deny parliament the chance to vote on our proposal to allow the public to have a real say on britains membership of the european union is an outrage
8951563 to allow a vote on a restrictive treaty referendum but deny one on the real issue of our membership of the
8951564 it is like allowing the british public to choose their mode of travel without asking whether they actually want to continue on the journey at all
8951565 both labour and the conservatives have colluded to keep this entire debate focused away from the fundamental issue of whether we want to be in or out of europe
8951566 the labour party is terrified of an open debate whilst david camerons conservatives are focusing on the sideshow of a referendum on the technical details of the lisbon treaty
8951567 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8951568 the government of canada is committed to developing canadas bioeconomy while delivering results for our farmers and protecting our environment
8951569 this important research and development network will help increase the oilseed value for canadian farmers and advance our biofuels industry
8951570 oilseed crops have the potential to provide bio based alternatives to a variety of petroleum products
8951571 the industrial oil seed network will transition non food canadian oilseeds crops from a low value commodity to a high value industrial feed stock that can substitute for petroleum in a variety of applications we very much appreciate the support of the federal government in helping us reach these goals

8951583 looked down her nose at tourists there to have a good time but was her own motivation much different
8951584 it dawned on me that the last thing this community needed was our unskilled labor most of the villagers were unemployed and during the dry season which would last for another two months they had nothing to do on their farms they didnt need giordano and me to build a community school that they could build themselves i weighed 100 pounds my contribution was little more than symbolic
8951585 i hope it happens because it means that i at least caught a pass and contributed in some form or fashion
8951586 it means ive been surrounded by phenomenal teammates who have allowed me to get open and do my job its a neat little thing but if we win the game then ill be ecstatic its an absolutely critical game and at this stage of my career ive finally realized that wins are more important than individual statistics
8951587 it kind of hurt him that he missed most of camp and the first couple of games of the season with a leg injury
8951588 its no secret that hes not the fastest receiver on our team and we have guys that get open deep
8951589 his thing is to get open underneath but there are times were going to throw downfield there are plays designed for him the coaches know he can get open underneath
8951590 jarious has handled the week well and the last two days hes felt a lot better but i think we would be foolish to expose him unless there was no other choice
8951591 buck played quite a bit in the last two weeks
8951592 i believe hes ready to go what has occurred has been good for buck he has a lot of confidence and i think his shoulder is as good as its been
8951593 ive played against both of them and theyre both winners so it doesnt matter who were facing well have our hands full
8951594 theres no pressure on me ive been in this situation before said pierce adding that hes more concerned about getting the team back over 500
8951595 youre never satisfied with that kind of record were a better team than our record shows we have a lot of talent on both sides of the football were just not playing as one right now thats disappointing

8951622 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8951623 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8951624 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8951625 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8951626 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8951627 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8951643 i just looked up there and saw those superstition mountains and it just popped in my head and i said you know guys how many people have died out in these superstition mountains looking for the lost dutchmans gold mine
8951644 i was on such a high and i thought maybe he would say well billy when you get back to morgantown maybe wed like to talk to you thats what i thought blaine was like gee whiz dad what do you think i said maybe theyll give us a chance for an interview and thats all i could ask for we went back to his room and talked it was a powerful night i never dreamed that would happen
8951645 i live in america too i live in a great land where their opinions are not only welcomed but are expected
8951646 you can say just about anything you want to say and its ok to do that however i live in the same great country and that gives me the right to get up put a smile on my face be in charge of my attitude and try to mold this football team into a positive top flight football program
8951647 he was a country boy from bens run west virginia over by the ohio river my dad probably never said a cross word in his life me on the other hand i was a lot like my mom she was a fireball but my dad was a great human being a world war ii vet they talk about the greatest generation bam stamp that right on him
8951648 my dad they say was the best mandolin player in the country
8951649 he was on the fast track our next door neighbors were grandpa jones and his wife ramona and my dad was great friends with patsy cline hawkshaw hawkins and cowboy copas the three people that were on that plane that crashed in 1963 dad wasnt playing with them in the big time but he could have been
8951650 im sure that broke his heart to do that but he thought it was the right thing to do
8951651 they said weve got to have you come to the grand ole opry and play with us he said im not coming they said well why he said im not leaving new martinsville im raising these boys
8951652 i really really took to the coaches they were good men and good role models and i thought man these are really special guys
8951653 ive always liked coaches from little league baseball and basketball all the way up i really loved the game and liked those men from that moment on i knew what i wanted to be
8951654 i came to west virginia and they measured me at 5 10 and 177 pounds
8951655 i thought i was ready to take on the world
8951656 i formed great friendships which i have to this day once i transferred down to fairmont state everything blossomed from there i got bigger and bigger and had a lot of fun
8951657 three years before i had been playing against some of the guys i was now coaching and they remembered me that was kind of interesting i was young and full of energy and thats when everything took off from there
8951658 we got fired at north carolina and i still have a crack in my heart over that
8951659 dick crum is a great man and is a great role model for me the best greatest and most polished organizer ive ever been around when they let him go at north carolina i will forever have a crack in my heart because it wasnt right
8951660 the loyalty that they preached all the time sometimes wasnt a two way street it wasnt 50 50
8951661 most of the time it was 20 80 and thats when i learned about the business
8951662 at vmi where i was blessed to coach i was just too demanding and wanted it to happen too soon
8951663 the program had been down for so long and it was a tough situation we took a shot at it and i will forever be grateful for the opportunity
8951664 i was too hands on as a micromanager i never was that cocky like i invented the game but i was full of myself and pretty sure fire
8951665 the things i didnt do well ive eliminated from my repertoire and wont repeat again i learned to hire good people and delegate after that im a whole lot more about delegating now than i was back then
8951666 rich gave me work for seven years and i in turn gave him loyalty for seven years i was happy for him taking the michigan job if thats indeed what he wanted to do i was cool with that
8951667 if a parent calls like this morning and we are getting ready for a staff meeting i have to take that call
8951668 i told the guys to start the meeting and ill be there when im finished
8951669 the coaches coach and i worry about the attitudes thats what im in charge of
8951670 im in charge of the attitudes and the overall atmosphere thats all the mojo thats what i really worry about
8951671 this isnt some boys club we get after them sometimes and hurt their feelings you can do this better or that better but my whole deal is morale the attitude and chemistry if the chemistry is right then you can do anything nothing can stop you

8951681 it looks like we are going to bring louis here we are getting him for no cost just now which gives us a great chance to get him here
8951682 he has had injuries and hes not been on the pitch as much as he should be
8951683 if we do get him on the pitch theres no doubt hes a very good player he adds qualities we will need i am confident we will get him out there
8951684 weve got him on loan for a year so we will all have a chance to see him me and the supporters alike
8951685 hes an ecuador international and weve seen him on the tapes we have been looking for a midfielder and this has become available to us so here we are
8951686 lars nearly came here a year or two ago and now we have brought him in
8951687 with tony hibbert injured this frees up phil neville to play in midfield
8951688 hes a danish international and played for them last weekend
8951689 hopefully he we will play an important part in the squad this season

8951704 one of the biggest challenges in regenerative medicine is to have a graded continuous interface because anatomically thats how the majority of tissues appear and there are studies that strongly suggest that the graded interface provides better integration and load transfer
8951705 every organ in our body is made up of complex heterogeneous structures so the ability to engineer tissues that more closely mimic these natural architectures is a critical challenge for the next wave of tissue engineering
8951706 keeping things clean i certainly didnt agree with the decision to delay our news until sometime after e3
8951707 bungie is always concerned first and foremost with our fans whenever we are prevented from exceeding their positive expectations it is not a laughing matter
8951708 actions speak louder than words tonights speech cannot obscure barack obamas lack of substantive policies for everyday americans from his opposition to drilling support for tax increases on the working and middle class and to his blindingly naive views on the danger of a nuclear iran senator obamas lack of experience and judgment continues to be evident

8951722 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8951723 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8951724 barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home
8951725 as a senator mccain has shown his independence on several issues
8951726 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8951727 sounds familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8951728 dont forget to take your cup with you to school
8951729 estos son tiempos dif ciles y entendemos el impacto financiero que este anuncio tendr en nuestros clientes
8951730 estas cifras son debidas en su mayor parte al descenso del consumo en espa a y mercados europeos en todas las categor as de producto que implican un consumo duradero
8951731 with rising costs everywhere i think it is easy for them to complain and possibly get a rent reduction and or hold off paying more rent
8951732 many tenants have filed complaints with dhcr because of problems getting lease renewals
8951733 with the transfer from republicans to democrats that itself could foster that impression and generate additional complaints
8951734 i believe on anecdotal evidence we are seeing more individual apartment increases
8951735 it is a certainty that the rent will be upheld
8951736 while any resident can file an unsubstantiated complaint dhcr has not once found that we overcharged a single resident as a result of a renovation we meticulously document our work we maintain receipts we are transparent and we act according to precise dhcr guidelines
8951737 its really important for this region to be understood by the rest of the world
8951738 when i was teaching the girls would complain that they werent encouraged and were afraid of failure but id point out it was the same for the boys but they just would never admit it
8951739 i would wait and pounce later and then theyd realise youre not just a frilly nothing
8951740 i remember one time in particular where i said something that was just meant to be a joke and it was too much and the ramifications lasted for years
8951741 i dont know how im going to keep them all together all the people involved in all our work programs right across the world but the buzz in the room was incredible
8951742 to the prime minister who saved australia in her hour of deadly peril
8951743 he was one of the greatest wartime statesmen and the preservation of australia from invasion will be his immemorial monument
8951744 he thought that the japanese would also attempt to secure air bases in australia
8951745 made more difficult britains task of providing as far as possible for australias security while observing a true sense of proportion in world strategy
8951746 can we wonder that deep alarm swept australia or that the thoughts of their cabinet were centred upon their own affairs
8951747 it seems clear that japan intends to capture port moresby and probably darwin also
8951748 there is an exaggerated perception these days that australias defences were weak
8951749 the invasion myth had remained alive for 60 years abetted by the seeming need of australians to dramatise their situation in 1942
8951750 i was told not to respond publicly a slap over the wrist for the incautious and inflammatory word pathetic in the original essay
8951751 i think thats why i did it no one ever said that i couldnt and no one ever made a big deal about writing
8951752 which also had a double edged gift behind them so to speak
8951753 in the beginning it had all of the romance that one associates with disappearing
8951754 the most traumatic moment of all is torealise that you have no language for what ishappening to you there is no way to containit all it just doesnt make any sense language fails
8951755 this is very much at the core of what i write
8951756 the language we need to do so is somewhere between the most banal and the most poetic
8951757 part of the whole journey through all of my incarcerations and return from them has been about rebuilding the language that one can use to approach trauma
8951758 is not my voice i have not spoken in three years not since i left boot camp it has been three years of a senseless war and though the reasons for it are clear and though we will continue to fight until we are ordered to stop and probably for a while after that none of us can remember the hate that led us here
8951759 if we are the great innocents in thiswar then where did we learn all the evil wepractise
8951760 i still think that i am working around the ideas of crime fiction but with different genres with the ideas of suspense menace danger
8951761 when i was 16 i loved james bond and robert ludlum and frederick forsyth
8951762 i guess it takes a while to realise that the genres are equal its not about the perception or prestige of a genre but rather the way in which an individual writers consciousness can handle the different genres i am still very drawn to the underbelly of things the things that no one will talk about and to give those things a voice
8951763 i think that my work is really against forgetting against silence against the difficult things that people dont want to talk about i find not that its my job or duty but that im drawn to the reasons why we want to erase certain narratives from our consciousness and so the work is essentially an exploration of that erasure and the reasons for it and an attempt to recuperate it
8951764 i remember being on a plane out of sao tome an island off the coast of west africa headed for portugal on a plane that had only one functioning wheel my brother charles was so thirsty for clean water that when he was given a glass to drink from he bit a piece of glass and swallowed it
8951765 and i was moving things around the closet anything to avoid writing my dissertation when i came across themanuscript
8951766 i re read those pages and thought this has been the book all along sometimes you have to write a book to find the book i realised that this was the story that needed to be told
8951767 part of me is desperately romantically in love with nigeria but the other part of me knows that doesnt match up in any realistic way with the truth of it

8951883 most people dont they cant run away from their fears and thats a privilege that i should be aware of

8951887 mona will stand as a testimony to the power of sexuality to drive creativity
8951888 overarching the collection is a view that sex and death predominate in art both as subject matter and also provide a significant motive for its creation
8951889 im interested in things we dont engage in and why we dont engage
8951890 world museums like the louvre or the british museum have an enormously important archival and academic role
8951891 but i also feel that they dont represent other visions and other ways of looking at art
8951892 and thats what we can do provide a foil to what the other public museums are doing a reminder to people that there are other ways of looking at things about art and that art isnt just controlled by art historians its accessible
8951893 we have to continually remind ourselves that if in any way or at any time the whole project ceases to be about david about this one individual then to some extent were actually undermining the project
8951894 if we try to turn it into a standard museum it ceases to be it must be something david is completely involved with in charge of makes decisions over thats the whole point of it
8951895 the private museum shows a character it might be quirky but it shows a personal direction and its another way of looking at artists and looking at art collections
8951896 in the public domain theres a recording or taking into account of a particular cultural story that takes place the private collection is an outward expression of personal leanings and thats always interesting
8951897 i think the more collections that are available to the public must be a good thing
8951898 i keep being told i must really care about the community
8951899 i couldnt care if i did it in sydney or hobart this is not specifically a hobart project
8951900 im doing it for me and the statement i want to make and if the outcome benefits the community that will please me immensely
8951901 i always found books to encapsulate the idea of civilisation
8951902 its hard to define what we call ourselves when we call ourselves civilised what does that mean but a book is the most pure presentation of that ideal i think
8951903 it should be observed parenthetically that i along with many people who share my interest in numbers possess some of the characteristics ofpervasive personality disorder or autism
8951904 before i garnered wealth i was often described as a nerd or a weirdo i seem to be begging for a retort here
8951905 is just what one over indulged individual happens to be able to do
8951906 im sure if you gave everyone a shitload of money most of them would piss it up against the wall he says
8951907 but every now and again someone would do something quite interesting and i suspect most of them would do something more interesting than what im doing
8951908 building a museum is eccentric and why wouldnt you think that
8951909 so here is someone spending 200 million building and populating a gallery that is 1m above sea level
8951910 theres no way im making a statement that i hope will be of any interest to anyone in 50 years so im making that point by building it in a place that probably wont be there in 50 years

8951922 i hate that the number is that high but drinking and driving is a dangerous combination a car becomes a weapon

8951930 spent a substantial amount with students and staff at the schools
8951931 behavior raised some red flags that caused people to start talking with each other and pretty soon somebody called our department
8951932 this was a very serious crime and we acted quickly to ensure the safety of the students and staff at the schools
8951933 through the cooperation with the staff at manchester we were able to promptly identify the person and make an arrest by 5 p m
8951934 he at least was here from the third grade on but i think he had all 13 years in the manchester schools
8951935 there were some minor inconsistencies that only a trained person would notice
8951936 but to the lay person who doesnt deal with this it is a deputy sheriffs uniform
8951937 this is definitely something that needs to be addressed so that a better level of security for the students and staff can be provided
8951938 weve always had a friendly atmosphere in the manchester school buildings but unfortunately im afraid things are going to have to change because of this
8951939 we will have to take a long look at our safety procedures and make revisions well have to make things tougher in terms of access to the buildings we almost have to create a fortress at the school to ensure maximum security

8951941 this new finding may help to explain why the clock is so far reaching in its effects on the organism
8951942 we found that some 25 percent of the genes in our model organism appear to be under clock control i wasnt suspecting anything remotely like that
8951943 it appears the clock influences a number of biological processes including cell cycling protein metabolism and varied signaling processes
8951944 but perhaps the most important role weve seen so far is the clocks role in ribosome biogenesis
8951945 the resulting molecular mechanism or genetic network for the clock identified by this mode guided discovery process will have a broad appeal to geneticists physiologists and those with an interest in signaling pathways
8951946 the methods used to characterize what makes a biological clock tick will have numerous applications in finding genetic networks describing other complex traits in many biological systems

8951998 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel

8952006 yeah ill relax the whole weekend so i can brace myself for next week
8952007 i have not talked him in to anwr yet but yeah arent you appreciative though that his mind has evolved into being open enough to say yes to that offshore
8952008 i will use the veto as needed and as the founders intended i will veto every bill with earmarks until congress stops sending bills with earmarks
8952009 i wanna eliminate this wasteful and outrageous earmark and pork barrel spending
8952010 i will veto i will veto every single bill that comes across my desk as president of the united states that has an earmark or pork barrel project on it
8952011 i have not talked him in to anwr yet but yeah arent you appreciative though that his mind has evolved into being open enough to say yes to that offshore we certainly need this we need it for american security for energy independence all those things we talked about last time i think we need mccain in that white house despite still the close mindedness on anwr i think hes going to get there though
8952012 folks up here want anwr to be unlocked by the federal government so that we can drill
8952013 folks up here want anwr to be unlocked by the federal government so that we can drill so that we can start contributing more to energy independence for the rest of the nation weve got a tremendous amount of resource up here and were ready willing and able to contribute when we talk about drilling in anwr were talking about a 2 000 acre plot of land which is smaller footprint than say lax the airport there in l a its a sliver of land and its very very rich in resources and again were ready and willing and able to tape these safely and help secure the u s
8952014 appreciate the presidents call to lift the moratorium appreciate the presidents call to drill in anwr
8952015 with all due respect to congress its pretty pathetic that action that theyve taken appreciate the presidents call to lift the moratorium appreciate the presidents call to drill in anwr to do all those things for american production opportunities
8952016 for years mccain has opposed drilling for oil in alaskas arctic national refuge area anwr
8952017 because the opening of the arctic refuge to drilling raises a host of policy concerns including serious environmental ramifications we do not believe this issue should be injected in the budget process opening up the arctic refuge proved to be extremely controversial in the 107th congress and was debated at length during the senates consideration of an omnibus energy bill ultimately on april 18 2002 by a vote of 54 46 the senate defeated a procedural motion to invoke cloture on an amendment that would have opened the arctic refuge to drilling with its strict rules limiting debate the budget is not conducive to adequate consideration of an issue of this magnitude we believe that the arctic refuge should be preserved and that budgetary effects of oil leases in the refuge are incidental when considering the profound negative impact of drilling in the arctic refuge
8952018 america will need oil for the foreseeable future what gives this generation the right to deplete this vital resource when we have the opportunity to preserve it for the benefit of future generations at the end of our day we still have prudent alternatives to anwr to meet our energy demands and we should aggressively pursue them a more acute energy need than our own in the future may require development where assurances of improved technology may better protect the environment with other viable energy options available to us today to approve anwr drilling would be a dereliction of our duty to posterity teddy roosevelt the champion of conservation once said conservation means development as much as it does protection i recognize the right and duty of this generation to develop and use the natural resources of our land but i do not recognize the right to waste them or rob by wasteful use the generations that come after us i have thought long and hard about this debate and the vote that i will cast i still hope we can achieve a more balanced national energy strategy but i am not convinced that a key component of that policy should be to drill in anwr i will vote against the motions to invoke cloture on these amendments
8952019 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves

8952038 i checked the index of the book gold was cited 23 times government debt 19 david walker only once
8952039 the book offered several options for dealing with the debt the movie had only one more government
8952040 the notion that government is the source of this problem and unlikely to be the solution was never raised the book made this point clear the movie carefully ignored it the movie focussed exclusively on the problems of paying this government debt the book explored other more realistic options such as repudiation and inflation the book explored the enormous malinvestments misallocation of resources folly and harm caused by the same policies that allow such a monstrous pyramid of debt and credit to be created in the first place the movie studiously ignored any mention of the harm these policies have caused to civil society

8952522 at 44 sarah louise heath palin is both the youngest and the first female governor in alaskas relatively brief history as a state shes also the most popular governor in america with an
8952523 truth is sarah was a better basketball player than i was i think i even played against her in junior high too and i think youre allowed to be just a so so player in junior high so we were probably more on par then esp since she was a year younger the year after i graduated she went with wasilla high to the state basketball tournament went up against the favored big anchorage teams and little old wasilla won state 1982

8952576 after several attempts at shooting the opera house from a moving ferry i decided to create a shot that would utilise the ferrys movement rather than trying to fight it by moving the camera along the ferrys path of travel you get this phantom like impression naturally and without post processing enhancement
8952577 having lived with the building for almost all of my life makes choosing a particular view impossible for me the building is the whole organism inside and out
8952578 this is the main reason for choosing the winning image it shows nothing it shows everything it is like an impressionist painting it lets your mind produce the images and fill in the gaps
8952579 the motif was depicted in so many beautiful and original ways that one could find a winner in many different categories however the winning shot shows the opera house in a subliminal way it shows the spirit of the building a parallel to the impressionistic sketches my father submitted for the opera house competition in 1957
8952580 it shows movement excitement vibrancy and an innovative approach he obviously gave it a lot of thought and did a great job
8952581 i just kept shooting and shooting and eventually i got a couple that stood out
8952582 actually it was quite frustrating because i was trying to get a nice depth shot and couldnt get it right so i thought ok ill try some blurry ones it was lucky that the distance of the ferry was just right it all workedperfectly
8952583 its very good for night shots as you can see from the image it really captures a lot of different shades of light
8952584 its a hobby i just love it im really happy to shoot whenever i get the chance
8952585 my approach was that the opera house has been shot so many times and so many professionals will do it perfectly that im going to have to do something to make it happen tweaking it or making it blurred there was a lot of luck involved

8952603 for many years the rule of thumb was once a cesarean always a cesarean as a result most women who had a baby by this method underwent a repeat cesarean when they had more children subsequently multiple studies showed that this rule was not necessarily the safest and most satisfying option for many women with a prior cesarean research and recommendations have shown that vbac should be offered to women in a setting where appropriate support measures and personnel are available saddleback memorial is one of the few hospitals in orange county to routinely offer this delivery option by providing such support and has achieved greater than an 80 percent success rate in patients undergoing attempted vbac not only does vbac eliminate the risks of surgery but it results in a faster recovery for new mothers and can provide a healthier beginning for babies

8952614 o primeiro ponto que a maioria das pessoas acha que o bolsa fam lia apenas um favor do governo e n o um direito trata se de um comportamento comum aos grupos subalternos admiradores da elite nesse caso o programa apenas cria condi es favor veis para refor ar algo que j existe
8952615 um direito das fam lias mais pobres para garantirem seus filhos na escola
8952616 as fam lias recebem o dinheiro e ponto final elas n o disp em de uma via para exprimir o que est acontecendo de errado por exemplo
8952617 um dos meios para fiscalizar as contas a internet mas esta ainda inalcan vel para a maioria o ideal seria apresentar os n meros em panfletos ou cartazes
8952618 claro que acontecem desvios como pessoas que precisam e n o t m acesso ao dinheiro ou vice versa mas seria imposs vel isso n o acontecer contudo considero que s o situa es marginais
8952619 as pessoas que dizem que o bolsa fam lia gera um desest mulo ao trabalho s o desinformadas n o existe efeito pregui a em nenhum pa s do mundo onde programas semelhantes foram aplicados como voc pode abrir m o de um emprego de r 415 para receber relativamente t o pouco do governo
8952620 o que existe uma mentalidade escravista no pa s h quem ache que pobre tem que ser pobre que normal um juiz ganhar r 20 mil de aposentadoria enquanto uma crian a morre de fome
8952621 o programa tem o m rito de ser muito focalizado nos mais pobres na primeira etapa essa popula o foi atingida mais do que em qualquer outra iniciativa p blica brasileira agora preciso transformar a vida dos pobres atuar junto a essa popula o tamb m com vari veis como educa o e sa de o governo deu o peixe a eles agora falta ensin los a pescar e a caminhar com as pr prias pernas
8952622 reconhe o que o bolsa fam lia atinge n mero maior de pessoas do que qualquer outra iniciativa
8952623 sei que o bolsa fam lia tem o objetivo principal de tirar as pessoas da fome mas preciso manter programas complementares de extens o de jornada na escola como acontecia com sucesso no peti e impor regras de controle mais r gidas tamb m necess rio pensar al m do bolsa fam lia
8952624 nos anos 80 portugal e espanha organizaram territ rios pegaram as reas mais deprimidas e investigaram a potencialidade de cada uma com isso melhoraram a economia local e a qualidade de emprego
8952625 uma das grandes causas da pobreza justamente a baixa escolaridade de integrantes da popula o de baixa renda temos percebido que a evas o o abandono escolar a distor o idade s rie e o trabalho precoce dos adolescentes s o agravados em torno dos 15 anos justamente a idade limite que havia para a concess o do bolsa fam lia

8952644 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8952645 over the last few years we have both been inundated with phone calls and emails from people keen to build their own green roofs or to convert their sheds and existing roofs to green roofs
8952646 as enthusiasts it is difficult not to reply to emails and answer phone calls but we both struggle to keep up so we decided to write the guide to try and give people a starting point big green roofs on large developments are one thing but there is also a huge appetite out there at the micro level this guide hopes to meet that appetite not only in the uk but also in north america australia and throughout europe
8952647 we also want to challenge the ikea approach to green roofs you dont have to go out and buy a system you can source all the individual components yourself hopefully locally and create your own unique green roof that is the second point of the guide when i started out 10 years ago i just wanted to build green roofs there was no information out there to help me so i had to learn through experience only every small building i have built has had a green roof installed and over 10 years you realize that it can be quite simple at the end of the day dusty and i just want to see more green roofs and we hope this guide helps add to what is already happening out there on the larger scale
8952648 nosotros la tenemos la previsi n de inflaci n m s o menos planteada entre un 33 y 35 por ciento pero sin producci n no va a haber abatimiento de la inflaci n y eso debe entenderlo el gobierno

8952650 y no lo que ellos el gobierno pretendan hacerlo mediante medidas coercitivas
8952651 with significant market and technology developments under way now is the right time to ask some tough questions about the future approach to regulation
8952652 set to outnumber fixed calls in the uk within the next 12 to 18 months
8952653 it was the usual thing really 1962 we were all into jimmy smith then 1963 brought dope and rock syd was one of the first to get into the beatles and the stones
8952654 he started playing guitar around then used to take it to parties or play down at this club called the mill he and dave gilmour went to the south of france one summer and busked around
8952655 bright extrovert kid smoked dope pulled chicks the usual thing he had no problems on the surface he was no introvert as far as i could see then
8952656 syd has always had this big phobia about his age
8952657 i mean when we would try to get him back into the studio to record he would get very defensive and say im only 24 im still young ive got time that thing with religion could have been partly responsible for it
8952658 syd was a great artist i loved his work but he just stopped first it was the religion then the painting he was starting to shut himself off slowly then
8952659 it was one of the first rock events id seen i didnt know anything about rock really
8952660 actually the floyd then were barely semi pro standard now i think about it but i was so impressed by the electric guitar sound the band was just at the point of breaking up then yknow it was weird they just thought oh well might as well pack it all in but we came along and so they changed their minds
8952661 syd was really amazing though i mean his inventiveness was quite astounding all those songs from that whole pink floyd phase were written in no more than six months he just started and took it from there
8952662 well his influences were very much the stones the beatles byrds and love the stones were the prominent ones he wore out his copy of between the buttons very quickly loves album too in fact i was once trying to tell him about this arthur lee song i couldnt remember the title of so i just hummed the main riff syd picked up his guitar and followed what i was humming chord wise the chord pattern he worked out he went on to use as the main riff for interstellar overdrive
8952663 well he had this technique that i found very pleasing i mean he was no guitar hero never remotely in the class of page or clapton say
8952664 i was sleeping in the woods one night after a gig wed played somewhere when i saw this girl appear before me that girl is emily
8952665 the first time syd dressed up like a pop star the second time he came on in his straightforward fairly scruffy clothes looking rather unshaven the third time he came to the studio in his pop star clothes and then changed into complete rags for the actual tv spot
8952666 syd was always complaining that john lennon owned a house while he only had a flat
8952667 i couldnt believe it at the time i had this firm picture of syd as this really gentle guy which is what he was basically
8952668 everyone is supposed to have fun when theyre young i dont know why but i never did
8952669 i think we tended to underrate the extent of his problem i mean i thought that i could act as a mediator yknow having been a sociology teacher at the l s e and all that guff
8952670 i think though one thing i regret now was that i made demands on syd hed written see emily play and suddenly everything had to be seen in commercial terms i think we have pressurized him into a state of paranoia about having to come up with another hit single
8952671 also we may have been the darlings of london but out in the suburbs it was fairly terrible before emily wed have things thrown at us onstage after emily it was screaming girls wanting to hear our hit song
8952672 ysee even at that point syd actually knew what was happening to him
8952673 i mean jug band blues is the ultimate self diagnosis on a state of schizophrenia
8952674 its awfully considerate of you to think of me here and im most obliged to you for making it clear that im not here and im wondering who could be writing this song
8952675 scream your last scream old woman with basket wave your arms madly madly flat tops of houses houses mouses shell be scrubbing apples on all fours middle dee tiddle with dumpy mrs dee well be watching telly for all hours
8952676 was around at my house just before he had to go to record and because a song was needed he just wrote a description of what he was wearing at the time and threw in a chorus that went vegetable man where are you
8952677 hendrix had his own limousine syd didnt talk to anyone i mean by now he was going onstage and playing one chord throughout the set he was into this thing of total anarchistic experiment and never really considered the other members of the band
8952678 at the time dave was doing very effective takeoffs of hendrix style guitar playing so the band said play like syd barrett
8952679 thats syd onstage syd used to play with slide and a bunch of echo boxes
8952680 yeah syd does resent the floyd i dont know he may still call them my band for all i know
8952681 syd was well into his orbiting phase by then he was travelling very fast in his own private sphere and i thought i could be a mediator of some sort ysee i think youre going to have to make the point that syds madness was not caused by any linear progression of events but more a circular haze of situations that meshed together on top of themselves and syd me i couldnt handle those stares though
8952682 i think syd was in good shape when he made madcap he was still writing good songs probably in the same state as he was during jugband blues
8952683 the thing was that all those guys had to cope with syd out of his head on mandrax half the time he got so mandied up on those sessions his hand would slip through the strings and hed fall off the stool
8952684 we really had basically three alternatives at that point working with syd
8952685 it was mostly a case of me saying well what have you got then syd and hed search around and eventually work something out
8952686 rats rats lay down flat we dont need you we act like cats if you think youre unloved well we know about that
8952687 the song just ended after syd had finished singing and i wanted a gradual fade so i added that section myself i played drums on that by the way
8952688 it was fairly ludicrous on the surface i mean you just had to go along with it all yknow syd would say something completely incongruous one minute like its getting heavy innit and youd just have to say yeah syd its getting heavy and the conversation would dwell on
8952689 actually listening to the tape afterwards you could work out that there was some kind of logic there except that syd would suddenly be answering a question youd asked him ten minutes ago while you were off on a different topic completely
8952690 i cant really comment too accurately but im rather tempted to view it as a symbolic gesture yknow goodbye to being a pop star or something
8952691 im really totally together i even think i should be
8952692 it was horribly frustrating because there were sporadic glimpses of the old syd coming through and then it would all get horribly distorted again nothing remains from the sessions
8952693 either that or he writes songs and wont show them to anyone
8952694 he just said it was o k yknow hes really not interested in any of it its ironic i suppose hes much bigger now as the silent cult figure doing nothing than he was when he was functioning
8952695 syd has always said that when he goes back into the studio again he will refuse to have a producer he still talks about making a third album i dont know i think dave is the only one who could pull it off there seems to be a relationship there
8952696 i last saw him around christmas in harrods we just said hi yknow i think actually of all the people youve spoken to probably only storm and i really know the whole story and can see it all in the right focus
8952697 i mean syd was a strange guy even back in cambridge he was a very respected figure back there in his own way
8952698 in my opinion its a family situation thats at the root of it all
8952699 yeah it was fairly obvious that i was brought in to take over from him at least on stage it was impossible to gauge his feelings about it
8952700 it wasnt just the drugs wed both done acid before the whole floyd thing its just a mental foible which grew out of all proportion
8952701 i dunno maybe if he was left to his own devices he might just get it together but it is a tragedy a great tragedy because he was an innovator one of the three or four greats along with dylan

8952717 i couldnt wait a week i wanted to talk to her some more
8952718 we talked about marriage we said several times that we felt like we are married
8952719 i have something for you actually i have something for us
8952720 i called them up and asked if they have ever done a wedding they went into overdrive for us
8952721 the people who worked there were so excited to have us come to their ride
8952722 we fit well together i dont have to put on another skin with her i can be who i am shes a sweetheart
8952723 i never met anyone whom i can be this free with he is such a genuine person i love that
8952724 he is full of thought he considers everything he does and he considers the people around him

8952730 gang of 14 senators from both parties whose purpose was to oppose pro life strict constructionist judges
8952731 immigration is a very hot topic every time i go to wal mart i have constituents approach
8952732 the lines are too short at hospital emergency rooms my children dont hear enough foreign languages in the classroom or during recess our school taxes arent high enough to pay for building new classrooms for our guests our jails are not completely full
8952733 now i have something to tell them thank you rep looper i can tell them to call you yes we have a serious shortage of illiterate peasants in america 10 20 million or more is not enough
8952734 we can close this deficiency by passing co hb 1325 the alien importation act of 2008 as with foreign oil lets increase our dependency on foreign labor
8952735 do you recall the defend colorado now immigration petition in 2006
8952736 all those mean colorado citizens wanted to take welfare state benefits away from our foreign cousins visiting us here from our extended world family
8952737 now a second branch of state government our responsive legislature is also heeding the public will
8952738 you say americans dont want this seasonal work at any wage
8952739 no wonder since the cato institute estimated about eight years ago that the cash value of colorados total welfare benefits was the equivalent of 10 05 per hour eight years later its probably closer to 14 per hour pretty good income for doing nothing
8952740 why work when government will pay you not to work
8952741 here we can show our international compassion and at the same time prop up the welfare state entitlements that created the wage rate distortion such a deal
8952742 obviously we cant use prison labor to pick crops as other states do
8952743 the convicts might object or get calluses on their hands or they might eat too much of the crops they are picking and contribute to our obesity crisis we wouldnt want that on our conscience
8952744 we cant let free market labor pricing work that is too radical a concept
8952745 once we implement this brilliant program for agriculture can manufacturing construction and other labor sectors be far behind
8952746 maybe we could also import our politicians we couldnt do worse
8952747 look how successful this program has been in germany and other parts of europe which now are overflowing with turkish greek and other immigrants angrily creating their own subcultures
8952748 we have plenty of examples of the results of our immigration tolerance both legal and illegal
8952749 nice foreign national who came to colorado illegally to serve you
8952750 hb 1325 is an ingenious solution to the illegal alien problem
8952751 it makes them legal because government gives them a piece of paper
8952752 of course over the next five years these 15 000 aliens will all go home when requested for sure we promise
8952753 how do we know because hb 1325 plans it that way and all laws work as intended right also we have their promises on paper no one will skip out and disappear in the vast underground of our growing and anonymous subculture
8952754 just because we already have more than 10 20 million examples to the contrary doesnt mean our failed immigration policy wont work this time besides theres always the next amnesty
8952755 democrats should support this bill even though it is a precedent to further undermine organized labor after all when the next amnesty comes these people are expected to register and vote democrat
8952756 republicans should support this bill to maintain their image of exploiting the little guy on behalf of big business another win win win for our noble and responsive political system
8952757 from the halls of congress we learn that the social service costs for just the illegal aliens is upwards of 436 billion annually
8952758 these figures are relevant to this bill because we will be importing our guests from the segment of third world foreign societies that provides the same people who now invade illegally we just bring them here first we thwart their illegality by legalizing it ta da
8952759 the america i knew growing up did not have these problems
8952760 we naively believed america had borders for a reason and that we were not the dumping ground for other countries workers trading their failed political economic and social systems for our own
8952761 yes colleagues we can pass this bill as a responsive tribute to the more than 12 to 20 million enterprising aliens now roaming around america
8952762 when the regular season starts its the ultimate ballgame we know that is it nice to win the games yeah but it doesnt mean anything
8952763 weve had good records in preseason weve had bad records in preseason what counts is how you play in the regular season thats what matters that doesnt mean the individual performances and some of the group performances and how you execute plays isnt important that leads to your execution at a later point in time id say thats what you gain from preseason
8952764 we just have to put that behind us and move on
8952765 we have no concerns the preseason is behind us its time for us to move on move forward and be ready for kc we had our problems but we have to get ready for tomorrow and get better
8952766 im looking at him right now and i see perfection

8952768 el jutge no te clar qui es mes burro dels dos
8952769 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8952770 medimos la fortaleza de nuestra econom a no por el n mero de billonarios que tenemos o por las ganancias del fortune 500 sino por si alguien con una buena idea puede tomar el riesgo y comenzar un negocio o si una mesera que vive de sus propinas puede tomar un d a libre para cuidar a un chico enfermo sin perder su trabajo una econom a que honre la dignidad del trabajo

8952791 consumers have got to adjust and there are two key steps to this making sure we pay the lowest possible price for our energy and learning to use less of it
8952792 consumers should look to pay by direct debit and move to an online plan where possible to get the best available prices those who have switched recently can afford to sit tight now to see what the final price rise brings
8952793 but those who have never shopped around before are already paying way above the odds for their energy they should switch today so that they can start to make immediate savings
8952794 after meeting with homeowners and community leaders it became clear that many applicants affected by the deadlines were elderly and low income louisianians who would be unable to comply with the program deadlines

8952798 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

8952822 you control prices and can do whatever you want and hopefully wont be having art sales where youll be discounting the work that you sold to collectors a week earlier for a specific price to a much lower price

8952862 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8952863 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8952864 the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam he loves our country every bit as much as we all do

8952892 a lot of them were the backbone of the community

8952905 i believe four years of barack obama will be terrible for america in the short term but the suffering we will experience as a result of his governance could prove to be very positive in the long term why for the same reason the jimmy carter years were terrible in the short term and positive in the long term obamas policies of taxing and spending and clamping down on freedom in health care and other areas will prove massively unpopular when americans see them fail as these discredited ideas always do obama and the democrats will try to blame past administrations for the problems just as jimmy carter tried to do they will try to blame the people just as jimmy carter tried to do but with democrats running congress and the white house it will be easy for americans to see who is to blame i can almost promise you barack obama will not be elected to a second term he will in all likelihood just like jimmy carter pave the way for a real republican president in 2012 if indeed there is one in the wings on the other hand lets pretend john mccain wins the presidency in 2008 in all likelihood there will still be a democrat dominated congress while u s policies under mccain and a democrat congress will be nearly equally disastrous it will be the republican president who bears the brunt of the blame in 2012 guess what well get then well get barack obama anyway or perhaps hillary clinton
8952906 the days of small garage type developers independence is becoming increasingly difficult quite frankly its gone beyond that it has become increasingly difficult for publishers too

8952921 im proud of the collaboration between law enforcement agencies to put this program in place its worked before and were betting it will work again
8952922 weve already had two inmates come forward with information that solved crimes in response to the cold case cards initiative and i anticipate some of our offenders on community supervision will do so as well i applaud this joint effort among law enforcement agencies and pledge to help in any way we can to assist in solving these unsolved crimes
8952923 these cards have been immensely successful in generating tips and two cases have been solved bringing closure to the victims families and friends
8952924 the attorney generals office welcomes the opportunity to collaborate with our corrections and law enforcement partners particularly on such a creative and important initiative
8952925 people are often fearful of providing information on criminal activity especially in a prison environment
8952926 crime stoppers is privileged to use our existing anonymous call taking network in this valuable initiative our greatest hope is to continue to gather the missing information needed to bring closure to so many grieving families in florida
8952927 the issuing of the third edition of cold case playing cards is a testimony to the success of this program distributing these to the thousands of inmates within the jails and corrections facilities in our state exposes the cases to an audience of people most likely to have come in contact with these individuals
8952928 this will provide an excellent source of information to help law enforcement solve crimes the florida sheriffs association is proud to be a part of supporting this effort
8952929 the florida police chiefs association wholeheartedly supports this creative and innovative program that provides visual aids and factual information as a means to jog the memories of individuals that may have information vital to these cases
8952930 it is the hope of our members that this program coupled with state of the art technology that was not available at the time of many of these murders will lead to many more solved cases throughout florida
8952931 it is the people who alone can amend the constitution to grant congress the power to enact such legislation as they deem necessary all the courts are authorized to do when the constitutionality of a legislative act is questioned is to determine whether congress under the constitution as it is possesses the power to enact the legislation in controversy their power does not extend to the matter of expediency if congress has not the power the duty of the court is to declare the act void the court is unable to find any provision in the constitution authorizing congress either expressly or by necessary implication to protect or regulate the shooting of migratory wild game in a state and is therefore forced to the conclusion that the act is unconstitutional
8952932 t he exclusive title and power to control the taking and ultimate disposition of the wild game of this country resides in the state to be parted with and exercised by the state for the common good of all the people of the state as in its wisdom may seem best

8952935 all federal departments and agencies shall seek to conserve endangered species and threatened species and shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of this act
8952936 would not be likely to appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival of the species in the wild
8952937 moreover the agencies would be under no obligation under section 7 a 2 to avoid actions likely to jeopardize the species

8952947 the commission has opened an own initiative investigation under eu antitrust rules into the intended cooperation agreement between ba iberia and aa
8952948 the european commission have rightly begun an investigation under their own initiative because they understand that consumers will be worse off if this alliance proceeds

8952952 when the vehicle did not stop after several signals the german forces opened fire at the car
8952953 when the forces later checked the vehicle they found two children and a woman dead and four other children wounded in the vehicle
8952954 first a vehicle approached the checkpoint but escaped when the forces tried to stop it
8952955 the forces opened fire at the second vehicle which was driving behind the first one and did not heed repeated signals by the forces
8952956 isaf soldiers fired warning shots in a safe direction away from the vehicles but were eventually forced to fire at the first vehicle when it refused to stop fearing an insurgent attack
8952957 isaf soldiers are trained to take the appropriate steps to minimize civilian casualties

8952959 sifma baselessly contends the broad statutory definition of a security based swap agreement should be so narrowly construed as to vitiate the authority congress gave the securities and exchange commission to protect investors by prosecuting fraud in connection with such agreements

8953066 anju spent a lot of time training abroad but could not deliver i have been saddened by her performance
8953067 the performance was bad and it is so disappointing to see our athletes not even recording their personal bests we need to make sure that the athletes who go to represent us at such events are prepared to the best of their abilities

8953181 part of what has been lost these past eight years cant just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits
8953182 what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose our sense of higher purpose and thats what we have to restore
8953183 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off and look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work

8953662 we dont check to see the yard is immaculate with blooming plants but we do check to see if the animals are being neglected or mistreated and that would include the cleanliness of the situation we found there was no problem

8953667 the leader of the criminal network original gangsters has had his residence permit revoked by the swedish migration board
8953668 the decision was made on august 21st and i dont know if he has received the message yet but we based our decision on the fact that he no longer lives in sweden that is the most common reason for revoking a permanent residence permit

8953671 i havent been playing well all year but in the last two tournaments i finished strongly and this week again im playing steady
8953672 this is my third straight bogey free round including the final round at brunei open last week and its been a good run for me
8953673 after more than 12 years it was only last year when i decided to adopt an aggressive approach and its paying off now
8953674 the wind was unpredictable today it proved costly especially with my shots off the tee im satisfied but im not too happy with how i was driving the ball today
8953675 i hope to produce two good rounds over the weekend the wind picked up in the afternoon which made it tough so it will all depend on the conditions on course

8953678 around the same time that i was reading your post highlighting the impossible promises of obama i flipped past nightline which for the third night in a row was covering nothing but the dnc do they give it this much coverage every time around
8953679 it was agreed that we would begin the process of developing a comparative project involving between fifteen and twenty european countries to examine the interrelatedness of the mathematics related beliefs of teachers and students teacher practices and student cognition
8953680 to assume that the development of enthusiasm is sufficient to guarantee achievement would be na ve as there are countries in which students have little enthusiasm for mathematics but achieve relatively highly and of course vice versa
8953681 one of the problems of english education is that students experience a fragmented and procedural conception of mathematics due to underlying notions of vocationalism and so rarely come to see the subject as a coherent body of concepts and relationships which can be worth studying for the intrinsic satisfaction it can yield
8953682 the situation in countries like hungary is almost the complete opposite all students experience an integrated and intellectually worthwhile mathematics taught by teachers with little explicit interest in the applications of the subject but an enthusiasm for logical thinking and the problem solving opportunities that mathematics can provide
8953683 where teachers do not necessarily expect to teach students in ability groups but expect to work with the full ability range achievement is generally higher across the board
8953684 our goal is to identify biomarkers that will help predict which patients will respond to therapy against insulin like growth factor several inhibitors of the igf pathway are in patient studies right now theres a large movement to understand which patients will respond to these drugs this is a step toward that goal
8953685 we have technology now to allow us to globally assess what igf is doing in breast cancer at the whole gene expression level
8953686 this is one of the first studies to do that we know that igf is bad in cancer but now we can globally understand it in a more comprehensive manner it could lead to finding biomarkers for patients response
8953687 we found that igf i is a major regulator of cell growth and cell survival
8953688 if you have something regulating dna repair you want that turned off
8953689 once patients are resistant to hormone treatment as with tamoxifen their treatment options are limited a treatment that inhibited receptors for igf might give them another option

8953693 its important for this club to be back in the uefa cup its nice for the fans to experience european
8953694 this is a big tie for us because we are aiming to get into the group stages
8953695 it is not an easy draw they are a good side the portuguese league is a tough one with teams like fc porto sporting lisbon and benfica but vitoria finished third last season so they cant be bad
8953696 it is a big thing for this club to be in europe and we are looking forward to it but weve got several important premier league games before that and well focus on those first
8953697 its a pilot project that we will then be able to install in other tourist locations that are at risk

8953721 i think one thing that helped me was frankly my ignorance
8953722 i had not done a lot of tv producing at that point i had written for a couple of shows angel nash bridges but i wasnt involved in a lot of production decisions i didnt have any kind of preconceived notions about how these things were supposed to be done
8953723 we didnt want the show to be 85 percent of a network show even though we had 85 percent of the budget
8953724 a lot of other shows have a tendency to try to glamorize the characters
8953725 working on this show they like it if you have circles under your eyes
8953726 it wasnt solely because of the creative success of the shield and fxs nip tuck but a lot of it was the economic success of the shield it inspired people to get into this original series business because we were making the show for a price that made sense
8953727 but thats the nature of tv and film its not the same as copying a test in school
8953728 i cant say i was lying in the weeds waiting to change television i just took the circumstances i was in and did the best i could with them and i think other people in my same position would have found similar ways to do things i do like the fact that we were sort of the first to do it
8953729 he and i had both been on police ride alongs him as research for being an actor on homicide me when i was a writer on nash bridges
8953730 i just said to clark i just want the viewer to feel like theyre on a police ride along and thats what he brought to it
8953731 we were able to make the pilot in such a go for it style that we eventually won the day i think on execution i think our director out directed their director i think we out cast their show they had jason priestly playing a drug addict and that seemed like a casting coup at the time because nobody wanted to put themselves in an fx show
8953732 some roles are exhausting physically some are exhausting mentally some are really devastating psychologically vic is all of that
8953733 you ever take a face cloth and soak it and wring it out thats me at the end of the day im a wrung out washcloth an overcooked noodle
8953734 an inordinate amount of focus is required to do our work on this job and its not just the words its not just the density and the complexities of the story its the traffic its the noises on the street
8953735 really it harkens back to that jack nicholson speech in a few good men
8953736 he is the embodiment of that argument i am the man on the wall you people who sit in your suburban households can look at what i do from a distance and go
8953737 one thing i learned from joss whedon that i blatantly stole was the idea of approaching the stories first from character
8953738 the cop stories were always the last thing wed figure out on a shield episode
8953739 you just start from the premise of what do you want to happen to vic and shane this week what do you want to happen to fellow cops dutch and claudette or danny and julien or vics ex wife corrine what hoops do you want them to jump through and then you figure out what are the best stories that allow you to do that

8953747 yeah but what about palin is she ready to take over from day 1 if necessary
8953748 well mccain always did have a penchant for the newer younger lady
8953749 in a weird clever way palins inexperience serves to illuminate obamas and so democrats especially joe biden would probably be wise to tread carefully here
8953750 colberg also disclosed wednesday that chuck kopp who palin had appointed to replace monegan as public safety commissioner received a 10 000 state severance package after he resigned following just two weeks on the job it was in light of the fact that he left a comfortable 19 year career on the kenai peninsula and took a job that lasted less than two weeks

8953770 if you are looking for young heroes and role models forget the highly paid athletes who leave their consciences at passport control
8953771 while britains athletes may have won more medals than usual they must remember that they are tainted with the blood of tibetans falun gong practitioners and roman catholic priests who are being tortured and held in labour camps just a few miles from the glittering birds nest stadium
8953772 mr coleman has gone out of his way to personally attack insult and disparage the remarkable achievements of the british team
8953773 we should be giving our young athletes all the resources and support possible not rubbishing and going out of our way to put them down
8953774 these athletes are not wealthy premiership footballers but committed and talented sportsmen who often fit their training around a full time job
8953775 there are of course concerns over chinas human rights record but the way to combat this is not by denigrating our athletes
8953776 it is offensive to suggest so when these fine young men and women are not only doing britain proud but are helping to open china to the world and the world to china

8953805 approximately 12 million people a year in the u s seek medical care for impacted or excessive cerumen
8953806 this leads to nearly 8 million cerumen removal procedures by health care professionals developing practical clinical guidelines for physicians to understand the harm vs benefit profile of the intervention was essential
8953807 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove cerumen from the ears
8953808 this can result in further impaction and other complications to the ear canal
8953809 the complications from cerumen impaction can be painful and ongoing including infections and hearing loss
8953810 it is hoped that these guidelines will give clinicians the tools they need to spot an issue early and avoid serious outcomes
8953811 every four years an astonishing array of conservative commentators and republican campaign strategists suddenly discover an intimate concern for catholic consciences and an overriding preoccupation with the roman churchs sacramental and liturgical norms
8953812 war and recession would push values issues back into perspective in this election cycle abortion is too large a wedge issue to abandon casually
8953813 who described herself as an ardent practicing catholic gave a response that was not only incoherent but managed to get wrong virtually every fact that might have buttressed her pro choice position which by the way is shared by more than half of all u s catholics
8953814 all this conservative crosier waving is about a simple set of numbers
8953815 the republicans think their margin of victory might be found in that 17 many of them white ethnic swing state voters presumed to be socially conservative
8953816 bishops are desperate to demonstrate that their flock isnt ignoring them on abortion the way it has on contraception for half a century
8953817 as part of a disinformation campaign to stir interest in the selection and to make it appear
8953818 open to all possibilities and therefore more of an independent candidate
8953819 its a philosophical position for the party that were fighting to get the party to embrace
8953820 what im saying is look at where the republican party is on whole life
8953821 that message competes directly with what i believe obama and biden will try to pitch the republican party can be one of compassion and theres a philosophical consistency for us that doesnt exist in their position
8953822 jattas actions in forging prescriptions were a serious departure from his nmc code of conduct as well as being against the law the nmc code states a nurse must be open and honest act with integrity and uphold the reputation of the profession
8953823 it is vitally important that we better understand the mechanisms of disease transmission during blood transfusions so we can develop the most effective control measures and minimize human to human infections
8953824 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection this suggests that blood transfusion represents an efficient route of transmission for these diseases
8953825 since the results are consistent with what we know about human transmission the work helps justify the control measures put in place to safeguard human blood supplies it also shows that blood from bse and scrapie infected sheep could be used effectively in non human experiments to answer important questions such as which blood components are most heavily infected and to develop much needed diagnostic tests
8953826 spurred a growing interest in home health strategies that can help curb costs by minimizing office visits and hospitalizations and may lead to better patient outcomes
8953827 gaining a foothold in the increasingly costly health care market
8953828 treat a wide array of patients from those suffering from congestive heart failure and diabetes to mental health patients and complex maternity cases
8953829 its getting a lot of attention now in mainstream health care to help cut down on costs
8953830 its been very successful when its done well in reducing the hospitalization of patients because you can reach something early
8953831 questions remain among some health care providers about who will be paid for which services
8953832 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8953833 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8953834 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8953835 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8953836 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8953837 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people
8953838 prior studies have indicated reduced bone density in hiv infected patients but little was known whether fracture risk increased in this population
8953839 these data are the first to suggest that there is a clinically significant increase in bone fractures among hiv infected patients using data from a large healthcare system
8953840 hiv patients with risk for low bone density should be assessed and potentially treated to prevent fractures
8953841 further research is needed into the mechanisms of bone loss in this population
8953842 fracture prevalence among hiv infected versus non hiv infected patients in a large u s healthcare system

8953879 the hindu mob threatened us saying that india belongs to hindus christians do not belong here
8953880 they warned us that if we rebuild the churches they would kill us they would break our body into pieces just like they broke our church into pieces
8953881 this is my message to the christians stop your conversions or you will learn a lesson from the hindu society
8953882 the goal of the hindu radicals is to destroy indias reputation as a secular and pluralistic democracy and replace it with an explicitly hindu identity

8954212 bold innovative live performance from philadelphia and around the world
8954213 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam
8954214 now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery
8954215 as someone who knows what its like to drive a 40 000 kilogram truck of wood down the road i can tell you that you need to be sharp to ensure that you the load and everyone around you is safe
8954216 drivers need to realize what theyre up against when they hit the roads during the summer holiday periods
8954217 there are more truckers vehicles cyclists recreational vehicles and motorbikes on the road and its important for drivers to be aware of this and go one step further to ensure theyre being safe
8954218 en estos momentos a n no sabemos cual ser el programa horario del fin de semana estamos un poco preocupados llegamos all sin haber probado y sin tener idea de nada va a ser una carrera nocturna y en la estaci n de lluvias as que no es precisamente lo mejor desde el punto de vista de la seguridad no parece que vaya a ser nada c modo
8954219 conducir una moto es algo muy distinto a un coche adem s ellos pilotaron en un circuito mientras que nosotros lo haremos en un trazado urbano
8954220 si alguien tiene dudas acerca de mi motivaci n que dude
8954221 este a o se han disputado dos grandes premios en espa a y para m es terrible si ir a las carreras resulta duro pero lo tengo que hacer porque es mi responsabilidad como tercer piloto se te hace todav a peor cuando es tu gran premio
8954222 tambi n ver que hamilton lo est haciendo bien o que est luchando por el mundial son cosas que motivan porque es el reflejo de que yo tambi n estoy haciendo bien mi trabajo s pero quiero dejar muy claro que mi nico objetivo es volver a correr mientras haya esperanzas lo seguir intentando
8954223 l gicamente no vengo a las carreras s lo para comentarlas por televisi n y ver c mo evoluciona mi equipo hago muchas cosas m s de lo que a veces se puede explicar s que es muy dif cil pero

8954225 no ser algo inmediato cuando fernando tome una decisi n y decida en qu equipo quiere competir entonces todas las piezas encajar n en su sitio
8954226 depender a del piloto en particular y de una serie de circunstancias es posible aunque en principio preferir a un contrato largo
8954227 si alguien tiene dudas acerca de mi motivaci n que dude
8954228 it is going to take everybody by surprise and thats what they wanted
8954229 being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough

8954242 conditions in the camp are very hard the occupants sole aim is to secure their passage to britain
8954243 you have to be very careful when entering these camps the people there mostly men have an illegal status they have no job and no home the jungle is a dangerous place and its not safe to go there

8954254 john mccain is going to make the choice from his heart hes going to choose someone who can be a partner in governing hes going to choose someone who brings character and principle to the table and who shares his priorities and im confident that hes going to make a great pick
8954255 too many people in a very very small area who are intoxicated and there are just problems that you have as the police department you have to respond to those issues
8954256 the reality is san jose pd is recognized around the country as being one of the most progressive diverse police departments it has a great working relationship with its community
8954257 we are extremely pleased to take on u s distributorship of tortuga rums
8954258 rum is a growth category and we foresee substantial opportunity to grow tortuga building on the success the tortuga brand has achieved in the caribbean islands the consumer awareness resulting from the tortuga rum cake business in the u s will assist in our development of the tortuga rum brand which in its own right is well known to the more than two million annual visitors to the cayman islands
8954259 this new relationship is an excellent springboard for the tortuga rum brand
8954260 gemini spirits amp wine has a long tradition of building successful brands in the american market we believe that tortuga is an excellent fit into their brand portfolio and look forward to being their next success story
8954261 were also pleased that well acquire a fast growing premium rum brand rum is one of the most attractive spirits categories and the addition of cruzan fills a portfolio gap in premium rum with the categorys fastest growing brand in the u s
8954262 this is a win win agreement that provides significant benefits to fortune brands
8954263 in exchange for accelerating the end of our u s distribution agreement with absolut well receive a cash payment of 230 million were also pleased that well acquire a fast growing premium rum brand rum is one of the most attractive spirits categories and the addition of cruzan fills a portfolio gap in premium rum with the categorys fastest growing brand in the u s
8954264 importantly by transitioning to a dedicated sales force focused solely on our brands well simplify our route to market in the u s and enjoy greater control over our distribution
8954265 our seven year partnership with absolut served its purpose but our spirits business is a much bigger company today with the scale and leading positions in key spirits categories to fully leverage the strengths of a dedicated sales force
8954266 we believe moving forward now with this distribution solution will provide valuable clarity and sharper focus to our sales force and will better support beam globals vision of building brands people want to talk about
8954267 this transaction serves shareholders significantly better than allowing the distribution partnership to expire in 2012
8954268 the termination payment from pernod more than compensates for our higher costs of distribution over the remaining term of the joint venture agreement from a strategic perspective well also benefit from a dedicated u s sales force and we see significant upside potential over the long term from the cruzan rum brand
8954269 we welcome fortune brands and beam global to the u s virgin islands
8954270 we look forward to working with them in the years ahead to grow the cruzan rum brand and to continue to explore new and cooperative ways for the government to assist in the development of the rum industry in the territory
8954271 it was really in the interests of pernod to have that control
8954272 doesnt seem to feel there is a great urgency to get into the vodka business in a big way
8954273 but who knows maybe they are talking to stoli right now

8954280 a highly advanced system on one of the cameras detected heat produced by the cells
8954281 i think to be fair to scottish natural heritage they convened a scientific panel that looked at flight paths they were keen to establish an exclusion zone and the aim was to provide a workable solution
8954282 unfortunately it has resulted in a decrease in unit numbers but it has allowed the development to go through and we will still be able to create 15 000 homes for the city
8954283 i suspect that because of the scale of the project forth ports will try to be as accommodating to objectors as is possible
8954284 but we have a huge shortage of homes particularly affordable homes in edinburgh and we cannot afford to reduce them
8954285 as the site includes two special protection areas protected by european law it was important to get this right
8954286 the project will now move forward to more detailed consideration of the various phases of the development we are hopeful that we can continue to work closely with forth ports and the council
8954287 significantly undervalues the company and its future prospects when compared to the shareholder value realizable under our recently adopted strategic plan
8954288 the board of directors unanimously concluded that your proposal is inadequate opportunistic and not in the best interests of international rectifier and its shareholders
8954289 the proposal significantly undervalues the company and its future prospects when compared to the value creation strategy being implemented by our management team
8954290 the sharp decline in its stock price and what i believe is the real likelihood of a hostile takeover may now be forcing management to deal with its problems
8954291 second the firm must bring in capital to offset the write downs no matter how dilutive
8954292 third it must re establish its relationship with key employees who feel that their incomes have been hurt because they were willing to take lehman stock rather than cash for their bonuses
8954293 this saga is not likely to continue much longer since i believe the result will be a positive one the stock is being recommended for purchase
8954294 lehman continues to be one of the most attractive firms in the business

8954296 john mccain is putting washington on notice that there is a shakeup coming
8954297 this is classic mccain i think its a great decision
8954298 its exactly what the obama folks were hoping he wouldnt do
8954299 this is classic mccain i think its a great decision
8954300 its exactly what the obama folks were hoping he wouldnt do
8954301 sometimes the pause occurs at levels very close to the low point and at other times the pause was followed by significant additional declines
8954302 this is obamas biggest lead since late july when he opened up a six point advantage following his summer speech in berlin
8954303 barack obama faced very high expectations tonight and honestly i think he met them and i honestly think he exceeded them
8954304 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8954305 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8954306 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this

8954308 everybody can relate to him the speech hit home with everybody
8954309 mccain has to do something real special to come out of this its a hard act to follow
8954310 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 of the time
8954311 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time

8954354 this is great news for stroke survivors because results clearly demonstrate that long term stroke damage is not immutable and that with exercise its never too late for the brain and body to recover
8954355 this suggests that the brain is responsible for the improvement we saw in patients walking ability it seems to be recruiting other regions to take on the job of areas damaged by stroke
8954356 many stroke survivors believe theres nothing to be gained from further rehabilitation but our results suggest that health and functional benefits from walking on a treadmill can occur even decades out from stroke
8954357 we believe exercise gives individuals a way to fight back against stroke disabilities
8954358 other studies have suggested that there are differences between men and women in response to different antidepressants but the evidence has been conflicting
8954359 this study is large enough and we were able to control for enough complicating factors that we feel confident there is a true difference these results have clear implications for the clinical treatment of depression
8954360 we dont know how many people have this pms2 variant
8954361 we would like to take these findings to human tumor samples if we could find out which individuals carry this variant it might change our decisions about treating them with cisplatin
8954362 one of the biggest challenges in regenerative medicine is to have a graded continuous interface because anatomically thats how the majority of tissues appear and there are studies that strongly suggest that the graded interface provides better integration and load transfer
8954363 every organ in our body is made up of complex heterogeneous structures so the ability to engineer tissues that more closely mimic these natural architectures is a critical challenge for the next wave of tissue engineering
8954364 the joy we get as actors is out of transforming ourselves into something thats not necessarily anything true to ourselves and its a power not being yourself and being in the role its just like another prop
8954365 americas hero worship has propelled the latest batman film up the charts as the second highest grossing movie of all time
8954366 we must not draw too many parallels between the old testament and the dark knight
8954367 drawing close parallels between the dark knight and old testament also misses the nuances of progressive revelation
8954368 its an effort to make him a symbol an attempt to make galileo one of the emblems of the churchs its the church which needs rehabilitation on this case not galileo he was right
8954369 we have seen a major improvement in iphone availability in the us throughout august it appears as though supply has met demand entering september as expected

8954380 at a time when many republicans are still clinging to pork barrel politics governor palin has quickly become a leader on this issue
8954381 she is a principled reformer who understands how badly wasteful spending has marred the republican brand
8954382 laws that forbid the carrying of arms disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man
8954383 this is a worrying trend and shows some people have no conscience when sitting in front of their monitor behind closed doors
8954384 the consequences can be severe its bad enough your neighbours can use your internet connection freely but this becomes far more threatening if someone uses your connection for criminal or improper activity

8954399 mcv go over there away from the yari subs coming
8954400 i hope he rots in jail its going to affect the sales of the record and its not fair the internet is what it is and you have to deal with it accordingly but i think if someone goes and steals something its theft
8954401 presently though we dont support this guys actions at that level our interest is in the original source we cant comment publicly at this time as the investigation is ongoing
8954402 as a result the court waived his appearance for that hearing he still must appear at future hearings
8954403 in retrospect we could definitely have bettered it ill say that straight up given the time we had it is what it is
8954404 tracks wow in my arms and 2 hearts are crackers they go off like a frog in a sock

8954408 oh i have to get the resonator and i have to get to alpha squad
8954409 i walk up to this guy on all fours and i look at him and i want to just stomp on his head why cant i do that
8954410 no its not going to define the game its not fundamental to our success and therefore its important to let that go and maybe put it in for the next one
8954411 maybe we should do a title update to rebalance this stuff or should we just save it for the sequel
8954412 is that a preference thing do we have a vocal minority whos making a lot of stink about something just because it goes against how they want to play or are you truly unbalancing your game and potentially hurting the experience for everyone
8954413 oh i saw this thing and now give me a title update over the weekend
8954414 what does the universe need to provide the author to be able to make their story
8954415 what does the comic book author need what do you need for that information
8954416 what does the potential movie script need for that information
8954417 they took some risks story wise and im really surprised in that
8954418 why have interactive movies failed why have the movie theaters with the three buttons where they pick the plot choices failed
8954419 give me the cinematics and a little bit of gameplay
8954420 screw it im going to go do 55 taxi missions

8954424 wow hes really strong and he knows what hes doing and hes a badass
8954425 this is kickass this is the most fun ive ever had
8954426 maybe i need to add more things to it and more things to it
8954427 maybe were going too complex because were so used to it
8954428 ok good we dont need to do any more with that
8954429 ok before we go into e3 we want to see like can somebody pick this up can somebody learn how to do this because its really complicated

8954439 la mejor manera de garantizar un equilibrio en el reparto de la financiaci n con un sistema justo razonable equitativo y solidario es negociando de manera multilateral con todas las ccaa y no s lo negociando y dialogando con los nacionalistas reaccionarios porque stos nicamente buscan con sus exigencias y chantajes dinamitar y dilapidar el principio de solidaridad interterritorial y enriquecer su propio bolsillo
8954440 espera que finalmente los nacionalistas no se salgan con la suya aunque con zapatero cualquier cosa puede ocurrir

8954450 i have been thinking of doing just a summary of the entire day versus every hour or every 2 hours
8954451 the probability that we may fail in the struggle ought not to deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just
8954452 as for that v p talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer
8954453 surrender dont come natural to me id rather fight you for something i dont really want than take what you give and i need

8954455 you have been king of my glory wont you be my prince of peace
8954456 theres no doubt that alaskans right now are dealing in an atmosphere of distrust of government and industry
8954457 im ecstatic that mccain has chosen a westerner a rock solid conservative not to mention a university of idaho graduate and its brought a new level of excitement for idaho republicans
8954458 its especially important to idaho because of energy and natural resources that are important to us its an inspired choice
8954459 it is a governors prerogative a right to fill that cabinet with members whom she or he believes will do best for the people whom we are serving
8954460 so i look forward to any kind of investigation or questions being asked because ive got nothing to hide
8954461 hopefully though this wont be a distraction and get peoples minds off what has to be done in the grand scheme of things
8954462 until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here
8954463 children are the most precious and promising ingredient in this mixed up world you live in down there on earth trig is no different except he has one extra chromosome
8954464 because of barack obama the politics in this state will never be the same
8954465 is he changing politics all together and how people view politics i hope so we have to wait and see
8954466 i think if we continue to see people become more empowered and more politically active then yeah
8954467 it meant everything in the world it meant that we counted it meant that he was interested in us and it meant we were interested in him
8954468 i just feel like that really made a difference for people
8954469 it made us proud to be democrats again it brought us looking to the future and expecting that something was going to happen
8954470 what is he doing to the democratic party here in idaho you know its hard to put that into words he has energized he has captured the imagination of the state and brought new people in like ive never seen

8954477 ttac called it gm turns down 56m tax credits for suv plant
8954478 as general motors corp showed off its 2009 lineup thursday
8954479 i found myself wondering whats the next malibu so i posed that question to a table full of gm employees during lunch at the automakers annual event to roll out coming models for the media the group looked at one another stammered and could not offer anything definitive
8954480 while no one at gms lunch table could name the next malibu individually each of them talked about some of the changes being made to many of the vehicles this year the sum of the changes is bigger than any one improvement
8954481 its refreshing to see gm take a good lineup and focus on how to make it better now
8954482 instead of just talking about all of the vehicles in its product development pipeline it may cut the lunch conversation short but it will certainly satisfy consumers
8954483 suggests that the overall economic trajectory remains weaker than initially thought
8954484 inflation will likely weigh further on household expenditure even if remittances have held up remarkably late of late
8954485 over the second half fiscal expenditure should become far more supportive of economic growth but is unlikely to entirely offset the drag from slowing exports and private consumption
8954486 we have to consider regional trade and investment activities that make the region a lot less dependent on the us economy
8954487 we still will be affected by the us slowdown although the impact will still be less than it could have been several years ago

8954492 the tatas pulling out of west bengal would be unfortunate for india nano is seen as a world car and has drawn international acclaim immediate political dialogue to find a solution towards keeping the project in west bengal is imperative
8954493 if the house of tatas known for its values and care for the society can face such resistance the much needed fresh wave of industrialization in the country could suffer

8954498 conservatives will be thrilled with this pick gov palin is a down the line mainstream conservative who will energize the base and reach across party lines attracting women voters independents and blue collar democrats
8954499 governor palin is a terrific contrast to the all washington ticket of obama biden she is a wonderful contrast to biden and a truly outside the beltway pick
8954500 put the champagne on ice and get ready for a party
8954501 people see her as the symbol of purity in an atmosphere of corruption
8954502 this is going to show people just how vindictive and obsessed the palins were with this guy
8954503 many of those who had been in positions of power and authority have been very envious over the past year and a half with gov palins great popularity
8954504 someone has to take a stand and change some things

8954507 so far people have been forgiving of her but i dont know how long that can last
8954508 maybe they shouldnt have let me fly but i wasnt showing much so they didnt know
8954509 at a time when many republicans are still clinging to pork barrel politics governor palin has quickly become a leader on this issue
8954510 she is a principled reformer who understands how badly wasteful spending has marred the republican brand
8954511 theres a blogger out of colorado who has been pushing her for quite some time for vp who says shes known as sarah baracuda
8954512 i am absolutely delighted by this selection once again john mccain has shown that he is an independent thinker who paints in bold strokes sarah palin is a conservative reformer with executive experience who will bring a breath of fresh air to washington she will be an ideal running mate for john mccain and will make a major contribution to our countrys future

8954552 france is definitely the good place to be when working around open source

8954554 in the u s open source projects tend to be narrow and only for leading edge organizations whereas in europe theyre mainstream
8954555 european organizations have a business opportunity to combine multiple open source point projects into solutions for business intelligence
8954556 the key for the u s is to introduce more support for open source in universities and colleges

8954606 hoewel ik net als cramer ook niet meer weet of hoe en waar ik die handtekening in 1986 precies heb gezet ga ik er blindelings vanuit dat ik dat beredeneerd en volkomen overtuigd heb gedaan sterker nog ik kan me heel goed voorstellen dat ik ook nu een blad zou steunen dat geheime overheidsstukken onthult waarin de regering plannen maakt die in strijd zijn met de wil van de tweede kamer ook als die stukken door geweldloze inbraak zouden zijn verkregen
8954607 joe i hope you will post this here is the way i see it none of us really now the truth of what is going on in washington i mean none we can pretend we do repeat things we hear read etc that we really dont know to be true and we will never know the problem is that we are still a country made up of many followers why do we have these groups still republicans and democrats arent we all supposed to be independent thinkers this is america and we have been given the right along time ago of freedom freedom to be independent thinkers i was a registered independent but was forced to choose a party to vote in the primaries why i voted for bush because i felt in my heart that he was the best candidate at the time i as many others are very disappointed in the way the country has gone in the last eight years but come on we cant blame one person for it many people are losing their homes today because they got scammed by mortgage companies and were not educated enough about buying those loans and because they over extended themselves many of the american people live beyond their means people are living just as our government is beyond their means our leaders need to get some control over this countries spending just as each american does not having debt will make all of us sleep alot better and allows us to spend much more time together as a family we are a country that now believes that it is where we live what we wear and who we know that makes us successful how very sad i told my husband the other day that there is no doubt about it that if we lost everything we had i could be just as happy with him in a shack as i would in a mansion it is time for the american people to be proud of themselves and to stop judging others the harsh words that people right even on your blog really hurts me it is so sad that we have to attack people to get our point across the ugliness of people truly makes me want to cry that people can be that cruel lets all take a deep breath start being kind to one another and start doing the right thing for ourselves and our families and get involved in making the changes in our government not just washington but in our own towns stop being pushed into overspending it is not easy these days to tell your children that they can not have that 140 pair of tennis shoes because our children believe they are not good enough in their friends eyes if they dont have it and then we feel bad for our kids and then we give in well isnt that what our government is doing yes people are going to be angry when government programs stop and money is cut but it is what is best for our country to get out of debt we have to pay the piper because we have not as americans been involved in our own government just like the city of salisbury salisbury city residence have not taken up their cross and demanded that this problem with how the city is run be eliminated we feed into paying the cable company outrages amounts for television come on people 80 90 100 for cable tv we tell ourselves that buying generic foods at the store doesnt taste the same or makes us look poor our kids tell us that they will not wear clothes from walmart people get a hold of your own homes and then step out into your communities and get a hold of them too i believe that obama is allowing us a sense of ownership to our homes communities and washington government and giving us the tools to get involved we must get involved to make the change thanks joe melissa malone

8954626 w e do not believe the hall street majority intended to declare a policy with preemptive effect in all cases involving interstate commerce
8954627 analog devices top line guidance came in a bit below wall street expectations however i think the problems are between the hudson and east rivers and not in norwood massachusetts the hometown of analog
8954628 what wall street appears to be missing is that since adi has sold off some of its lower profit business units its seasonal sales patterns have changed adi is now again driven by industrial market sectors much more than it was even just last year
8954629 therefore its conservative guidance of flat to up 3 sequentially shouldnt have been a big surprise nor a cause for concern as a matter of fact with its minimal exposure to pc and consumer markets i think flat to up 3 is pretty good
8954630 what wall street would be better to focus on are the operational improvements adi has made in its july quarter adi improved its pro forma operating margin to 26 5 from 26 2 last quarter and again reduced its inventory which sits now at the lowest level weve seen since 2004
8954631 if we look back at last year and include the results from divested businesses its operating margin was only 22
8954632 excluding those businesses in the july 2008 quarter adi reported sales of 659 million a very modest 3 decline however when we look at pro forma gross profit dollars adi generated 403 7 million in the july quarter this year versus 391 1 million last year if this is bad i want more bad
8954633 in my prior review of the stock i wrote that it was time to hold off on accumulating shares of adi due to the price appreciation we had seen from buy recommendations made earlier in 2008 i now believe its time to accumulate shares again at the current price of 28 91 and follow through to as high as 31
8954634 i think he was in there for about 47 minutes
8954635 a couple other people though said it may have been closer to 55 minutes

8954657 the candidates are in a statistical dead heat the selection of joe biden as a running mate did not give barack obama the bounce he was expecting nor does anyone expect biden to bring any state other than his small home state of delaware to barack obamas winning column a year ago the american people were ready to impeach bush over the war in iraq and now incredulously senator john mccain is pursuing the war and his role in promoting it as an asset instead of a liability several months ago fuel prices reached record highs and are still hovering astronomically the current mortgage crisis happened on the presidents watch and thousands of people are losing their homes and yet despite siding overwhelmingly with president bush on what have been characterized by democrats as failed policies senator mccain is still in a dead heat with senator barack obama
8954658 overshadowing senator obamas crowning moment was an unresolved tension with the clintons having maligned his ability and character during the primary they provided ample fodder for the mccain campaign which consistently features her attacks against obama in their own television advertisements curiously absent from senator clintons speech on tuesday night was any mention of barack obamas fitness or ability to lead this country going forward to make matters worse on tuesday president bill clinton posed a hypothetical question which seemed to suggest that electing senator obama would lead to a complete loss while electing mccain would at least provide a modest gain however they dont call president clinton the best politician of his generation for nothing and he showed why on wednesday night delivering both the strongest endorsement of senator obama and the most stinging rebuke of bush and mccain heard thus far at the democratic convention
8954659 if nothing else the events of this week provided the catharsis among her voters that senator clinton wanted it was evident from the tears cheers and jeers that poured freely from delegations that the democratic party has come together finally the divisions seem to have been healed at least for now by capitalizing on the clintons ambitions and giving them time to shine obama conquered his enemies by turning them into allies and in the process demonstrated that while he might be on the ropes he is certainly no dope

8954691 im not even sure i would have gone through with it
8954692 the evidence i received he busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
8954693 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
8954694 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
8954695 i didnt even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news
8954696 what bothers me is if you throw a rock hes about four blocks away
8954697 which is a substantial step toward and more than preparation for the commission of the crime

8954975 ich denke es stehen in der beginnenden saison sehr viele aktivit ten an
8954976 die beziehungen die wir schon w hrend der vergangenen saison zu den politischen entscheidungstr gern der europ ischen union verst rkt haben m ssen wir weiter intensivieren
8954977 dar ber hinaus gibt es weitere wichtige themen das training und die ausbildung junger spieler deren schutz und die festlegung eines mindest transferalters au erdem steht immer noch das konzept f r mehr einheimische spieler im raum
8954978 ein weiteres bedeutendes feld ist das der finanziellen regulierung und der klublizenzierung zusammen mit den klubs und den ligen suchen wir nach m glichkeiten einer anderen und verbesserten finanziellen regulierung auf europ ischer ebene vorbildcharakter k nnte die einigung haben die wir mit den nationalverb nden getroffen haben das ist ein komplexes thema und hat nicht mehr viel mit dem einfachen fu ball auf der stra e zu tun es ist aber sehr wichtig ein gr eres gleichgewicht zwischen unseren wettbewerben und im europ ischen fu ball insgesamt herzustellen
8954979 das wusste ich aber schon bevor ich den job angenommen hatte er ist eine starke f hrungspers nlichkeit und hat viele ideen wir m ssen ihn weiter unterst tzen und diese ideen konkretisieren und in die tat umsetzen ich denke die f hrung der uefa ist in sehr guten h nden

8954993 he hecho un partido correcto y estoy feliz de estar en tercera ronda en el primer set he jugado bien pegando buenos golpes de derecha en el segundo l ha entrado un poco m s en juego y en le tercero ha empezado a jugar mejor pero lo importante es que con el 3 0 en contra he sabido reaccionar a tiempo para ganarlo

8955003 nunca se puede decir que un grupo es f cil pero sobre el papel tenemos muchas opciones

8955006 its about the future and barack obama loves the future because thats where all his accomplishments are
8955007 it is vital to understand that russia has designs on eastern europe and is using its energy supply to buy off western europe the future looks bad if this is the case yet there is a question here that needs answering first natural gas while cheap to burn and an efficient form of energy is not the only source of electricity western europe has germany and britain both possess abundant coal france has based its energy profile on nuclear both could provide russia free energy across western europe yet both are reviled by environmentalists wind power and renewables beloved by environmentalists are simply not up to the job it therefore seems that when faced with a choice between empowering russia and annoying environmentalists western europeans are less afraid of the former lets also remember that the kyoto protocol is designed to see large amounts of western european money transferred to russia as european nations purchase credits for emissions reductions banked by russia following the collapse of communism european nations cant reduce emissions on their own for the aforementioned reasons so they need to buy credit from elsewhere this was the central reason behind russias ratification of the kyoto protocol to put it bluntly the kyoto protocol is subsidizing putins military retrenchment if the supposed oil wealth funding of madrassas is a problem then i suggest this one is at least as big this is needless to say a terrible situation to be in when environmentalists get their way putin gets his if putins energy weapon is to be neutralized western european governments need to face down the environmental lobbies in their countries and allow digging for coal and new nuclear build political calculus however suggests otherwise and putin knows this

8955045 well this is the noun of a prepositional phrase it isnt possessive or partitive and it doesnt appear to be one of those few descriptive uses so it cant be genitive im guessing its probably dative though it could be accusative under certain circumstances

8955047 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8955048 seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people
8955049 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change
8955050 but we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future
8955051 these are all good measures we have got to do all these things
8955052 but where are the big new ideas we need the mayor to find ways to reduce our dependence on oil for example
8955053 if the mayor ignores the contribution transport makes to climate change he is ignoring a major part of the problem
8955054 und die lage wird schlimmer da das wetter schlecht bleibt

8955061 wir erleben derzeit eine nachfrage nach hd bertragungskapazit ten sowohl bei free tv als auch bei pay tv kan len vier bis sechs neue sender planen den kurzfristigen einstieg in hd
8955062 bis dahin werden die ffentlich rechtlichen sender ausgew hlte sportereignisse wie die leichtathletik weltmeisterschaft und die olympischen winterspiele in hd qualit t senden
8955063 this has certainly been more complicated than running a raffle this has all been done in discussion with the electoral commission at the end of the day we did raise 120 000
8955064 satisfied that all our donations fully comply with the law
8955065 obviously we carry out diligent checks on all donations and take care that we are fully compliant with the law we are grateful to all our donors for their kind support
8955066 after thorough testing of both old and new equipment we can conclude that everything works perfectly and the shutdown has been successful in every way the reason for the good result is careful planning and a qualified and enthusiastic organisation
8955067 we have for a long time worked on improving the efficiency of the scheduled shutdowns this shutdown shows that by proper planning an organisation can perform complicated jobs faster without compromising safety
8955068 we know what it can do were doing what we have to however we also know how bad things could get and were ready for them
8955069 when it all came down to choosing baylor university and texas a amp m were my top two choices but like i said i just felt comfortable
8955070 i was overwhelmed with the decision but i am very pleased with the place i chose
8955071 theyre giving me the opportunity so im going to take it
8955072 it was definitely part of the decision growing up with those guys and playing baseball with them
8955073 everyone you play is good and youve got to bring your a game every time you play
8955074 theyre going to give me the opportunity to pitch whether its over the weekend middle of the week or out of the bullpen ill do whatever i can do to help a amp m win
8955075 this is an awesome framework for the industry to aspire to and ultimately so that we can provide our customers with the gaming experience that they have wanted for years and really deserve
8955076 as an industry we need to begin setting some basic common sense standards that reward pc gamers for purchasing our games
8955077 the console market effectively already has something like this in that its games have to go through the platform maker such as nintendo microsoft or sony but on the pc publishers can release games that are scarcely completed poorly supported and full of intrusive copy protection and then be stuck on it
8955078 this is an awesome framework for the industry to aspire to and ultimately so that we can provide our customers with the gaming experience that they have wanted for years and really deserve
8955079 the pc market loses out on a lot of sales because a significant percentage of our market has pcs that may or may not be adequate to run our games without the ability to return games to the publisher for a refund many potential buyers simply pass on games they might otherwise have bought due to the risk of not being certain a game will work on their pc the average consumer doesnt know what pixel shader 2 0 support means for instance
8955080 this has certainly been more complicated than running a raffle this has all been done in discussion with the electoral commission at the end of the day we did raise 120 000
8955081 satisfied that all our donations fully comply with the law
8955082 obviously we carry out diligent checks on all donations and take care that we are fully compliant with the law we are grateful to all our donors for their kind support
8955083 if the rains are good these cuttings should germinate in less than two weeks
8955084 but our indigenous types of cassava normally germinate after three weeks and even then they are either infected with disease or they simply do not thrive as well as these ones
8955085 we had a meeting yesterday with the members who attended the course and they taught us that we should be planting shorter pieces like this
8955086 they also said we should plant one piece per hole which is different from what we have been doing in the past which is to plant two pieces
8955087 so we plant two pieces in one hole if one is eaten by the termites the other will survive
8955088 i think teams who have these deficits should be kicked out of europe
8955089 the only way to go is that there is a control over all of europe and i think it will go that way whether you like it or not
8955090 its better to be home than away before premier league games i must say but it depends as well on what kind of position you are in the group stage of the champions league
8955091 it depends on what sort of security you have in the champions league group stage at that time
8955092 basically for the quality of the premier league its good that so many teams are in europe and they stay in for as long as possible it evens a little bit the physical strain on all the teams in the premier league
8955093 it gives you an edge in the premier league if you qualify early because you are not under stress to give absolutely everything in one important group game the fourth fifth or sixth that could give you an edge
8955094 but it is very difficult to predict as well that you will qualify early
8955095 last year for the first time they reached the quarter finals
8955096 turkish sides always have a good support i think you know about that
8955097 porto had more experience than any other team in the top level of the champions league
8955098 they have already won it and have been there a few times in the final part of the champions league
8955099 for me dynamo kiev is a bit of an unknown quantity for the moment
8955100 they look like they always have the best players around there

8955107 you cant feel the pleasure of the treasure without pressure
8955108 the fact that librarians perhaps by nature constantly seek to create order out of chaos can also lead to feeling of being overwhelmed by a geyser of information that is simply too difficult to keep up with sometimes this can lead to frustration and ultimately anger
8955109 take time even for only a few minutes in your office to just sit and breathe counting your breaths to ten and starting over

8955111 outgrowing homegrown is your in house billing system hampering your growth
8955112 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted

8955120 theyre giving them unique offers they wouldnt have had otherwise
8955121 so the consumer is smiling as theyre getting out because theyre redeeming an average of two offers per trip
8955122 the consumer is now buying more because theyre getting relevant offers that encourage them to buy what they might not have bought otherwise
8955123 ive seen this technology come up in the past i dont know whether it was the technology or usability but it drove customers out of the stores
8955124 things like this need to be extremely easy to use
8955125 we dummied it down to make it easier to save time
8955126 it was too complex before too powerful therefore it was not adopted
8955127 we do have in some stores kind of in the area of natural foods some tv screens that talk about eating properly and things like that
8955128 there are some mommy tips but thats just hit or miss and not in many stores
8955129 you can get an overall snapshot and it will tell you if youre high or low on specific nutritional attributes
8955130 for instance it will tell you if it looks like youre consuming too much sodium
8955131 you can drill down to figure out what youve purchased
8955132 if youre looking for cereal thats low in sugar and high in fiber it will help you find that with foodflex initially when you sign up you provide certain information about your family how many people matters in calculating what youre buying
8955133 the first challenge was crossing the chasm getting over the big hurdle of having one retailer spend millions of dollars in putting it into hundreds of stores
8955134 seeing that the benefits are real theyre now expanding the program and stop amp shop will roll it out to more stores
8955135 well wasnt this a pretty special night to end a pretty special week i cant tell you how proud i am of my husband who delivered a speech of a lifetime and now the work begins
8955136 i think today that promise was fulfilled in a way that i never imagined in my lifetime
8955137 what i saw with barack obama was something that was transcendent and i felt transformational for me as a human being and for this country and i only pray in the deepest part of my being that america will rise to this moment
8955138 its going to be hard youve been hanging out with democrats all week

8955180 we continue to demonstrate our focus on operational efficiencies and costs at our operations with the long term objective of reducing our cash costs below the industry average

8955230 i looked online a lot there are a lot of websites there are a lot of heartbreaking stories about women i talked to friends of mine who tried very hard to have children and found out what it is that they actually do theres the kind of cuckoo rituals that they have i use the word cuckoo loosely but how far the obsession goes to taking your temperature to what to do after sex to make sure that everything stays in the right place
8955231 ive already played a british wife on hbo i did in mind of a married man i think there are a host of prejudices that americans have about a brit its just easier that theyre all american and that were not dealing with a cultural thing were not dealing with oh shes a cold brit were just dealing with theyre americans it peels back one layer of prejudice about this woman whos already a tough cookie as it is
8955232 no i dont think so it had less to do with the network and more to do with trying to keep her as warm and accessible as i could
8955233 i think it succeeds in being both very very realistic and at the same time it would be incredibly banal and boring to watch if all you were doing was watching people say pass the corn flakes weve run out of milk you need to cook its your turn to i think cynthias done this incredible job of welding the banalities of everyday life with the drama of everyday life and how the drama is actually borne out of these little banal moments seemingly banal moments

8955318 women who suffer severe losses in their young age should be considered as a breast cancer risk group and be treated accordingly

8955396 we happen to be the only team in the league flying in all our players next week which is of course not going to happen at the moment
8955397 its a knock on effect of the zoom deal which included flying our players in and out every season
8955398 we also lost another sponsor because they thought that their contribution would not be enough now that we have lost zoom they have completely backed out

8955401 816 000 americans fell into poverty in 2007 including nearly 500 000 children bringing the total increase in american poverty under president bush to 5 7 million
8955402 the bottom line is that this is the best news the republicans could expect in this environment

8955425 he basically holds the responsibility of the entire mission of the cic being able to collaborate all of their information and data on the portal
8955426 its a heck of a lot of responsibility for a specialist to have he is extremely sharp and as a matter of fact he is the system expert for the portal as numerous brigades come to him
8955427 we actually send him up to taji and hes been to some of the other forward operating bases to build up their portals to get them going and working correctly
8955428 he also trains up a lot of the civilian contractors that deal with sharepoint and brings them up to speed when they come into theater
8955429 basically what i do is make sure that the sharepoint is up and functioning
8955430 that way our units our subordinate units and their leaders can pass information with a good flow its a very critical job because of the emphasis of sharing information
8955431 without communications the division is dead in the water and we cant perform our mission in combat
8955432 we have to specifically lock down our network and consistently do scans to look for devices that are not authorized so we can keep this network secure and safe and to prevent people from bringing in viruses trojans and worms
8955433 its a consistent battle because you have people that dont fully comprehend or understand the value of this network and how valuable it is to the overall mission
8955434 its an ever growing field and everythings always getting better
8955435 as its getting better and more sophisticated we have to go out there and learn it so that we can provide tech support to people who are using the new software if we help people they dont mind helping us back and its a really good community
8955436 the soldiers and the ncos are the key element to this entire mission and without them it wouldnt function

8955546 blessing is a form of success that is much more than adequate it is on the side of the great rather than merely good and similarly the curse for failure to keep the commandments leads to a blight far worse than the purgatory of the non blessed but adequate middle two extremes are before you the blessing and the curse to achieve according to what you choose

8955722 lincoln is home to britains greatest collection of medieval jewish houses which are a testimony to its importance as a centre of jewish life in england jews lived here for the better part of two centuries most of the time in comparative peace and harmony which the periodic uproars and tragedies have tended to disguise

8955745 we have been following the same procedures for years whenever we decide to send objects to exhibitions held in foreign countries currently an object from a turkish museum is being displayed at the exhibition hadrian held at londons british museum and an expert we have sent there protects it the organizers of the byzantium 330 1453 were eager at the beginning but then they changed their attitude our experts are also responsible for reporting the daily condition of an object or objects when they are displayed at a museum in a foreign country staff from the royal academy of arts said they could not accept that and therefore they gave up asking for objects from turkish museums

8955750 when i was a baby i bit my mommy when my teeth grew in but only when i was drinking
8955751 the main purpose of this experiment is to reduce water
8955752 so far this season weve used half the water and energy with this system compared to a traditional rice field if you have to pump water to flood a field thats more energy that youre consuming for rice production
8955753 on our flooded field we used about 2 million gallons of water on a 6 acre field in just two and a half weeks
8955754 on the pivot system we havent even put out 1 million gallons yet and weve been watering for probably three weeks longer
8955755 with the demand of rice in the world and people in asia not having enough rice we can grow more rice in more fields with this system
8955756 with center pivot irrigation we could grow rice on fields with hills it really opens up possibilities to other farmers who couldnt grow rice before because their soil or landscape wouldnt allow it
8955757 its very sandy and has a bad history of weed problems
8955758 but we want to see what we can do under the worst circumstances because if we can prove it to farmers under those conditions theyll feel more comfortable trying it on their own land

8955762 the good news is that the sector is still outperforming others over the next two years
8955763 its just a matter of getting through the storm by focusing on the right markets the right suppliers and the right categories weve got to run a tighter smarter business
8955764 the biggest mistake luxury brands make is in not sticking with their core value system and core customer
8955765 i dont think you could say that by staying true a brand is guaranteed success however if they dont stay true success will be much more difficult to come by

8955784 but what i think is most interesting about this story is the way russia is asserting itself i dont know what was going through the georgian presidents head you dont attack russia with just 17 tanks he must have thought he had support from the u s and europe but what could the u s or europe do we know that the russians can cut off natural gas to europe anytime they want they have the energy we dont if they cut off the gas it will be a long cold winter for us and the united states putin knows that the u s is bogged down in iraq and he knows too that the u s doesnt have any money in geopolitics the country with the energy and the money wins and right now thats russia

8955853 point by point refutation of the claim that the man is all empty talk
8955854 everyone knew that barack obama can give a good speech and he did just that tonight the obama we heard from was an attractive figure too bad he doesnt exist
8955855 there was no escaping the emotional power of watching obama a black man with a name that does not flow easily from the american tongue step forward to stand center stage of history tears were not an uncommon sight during the speech
8955856 a forceful challenge to john mccain and the republicans and a restatement of the message to change washington and the nation that propelled him to the nomination
8955857 the speech itself lacked lift but had heft it wasnt precisely long on hope but i think it showed audacity
8955858 obama proved tonight again that hes one of the few most gifted public communicators of the last generation
8955859 but this time he proved it by not excelling in soaring rhetoric or delivering a speech that will be remembered for the ages rather he recognised that tonights speech didnt have to be an effort to join the rhetorical hall of fame

8955903 we were overwhelmed by the generosity of our donor the only right response was to be overly generous back
8955904 i hope it inspires other people to be generous to their churches and to charities everywhere especially in light of the economy

8955913 our national colours and melodious anthem echoed not just at the olympic stadium but also in million of homes across the globe you have brought fame and glory to our country
8955914 the rest of the world had written kenya off particularly after the happenings early this year now that our team has come so jubilant so successful from beijing a time like this is celebration time because it also unifies our country
8955915 they made kenyans forget tribe and party they made kenyans proud to be kenyans one nation united under one flag singing one anthem living one dream
8955916 kenya participated in just five out of the 28 disciplines in the olympics i would therefore like to challenge our sports managers to expand the number of events that kenya participates in
8955917 i long to hear that you have declared an independency and by the way in the new code of laws which i suppose it will be necessary for you to make i desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors
8955918 do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands
8955919 remember all men would be tyrants if they could if particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies we are determined to foment a rebellion and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation
8955920 that your sex are naturally tyrannical is a truth so thoroughly established as to admit of no dispute but such of you as wish to be happy willingly give up the harsh tide of master for the more tender and endearing one of friend
8955921 why then not put it out of the power of the vicious and the lawless to use us with cruelty and indignity with impunity
8955922 men of sense in all ages abhor those customs which treat us only as the servants of your sex regard us then as being placed by providence under your protection and in imitation of the supreme being make use of that power only for our happiness

8955938 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves

8955945 what scott realises is that this is going to be a very difficult fight to win on points
8955946 i think hes going to have to go out there and try and beat the guy up take the fight to him and thats the attitude scotts taking into this
8955947 he has to change his style a little and scott can fight if you back him into a corner he can fight
8955948 you could hardly get a bigger top of the bill than the ruiz and valuev fight so its a big step for scott maybe as big as the danny williams fight
8955949 if he was to pull this off theres so many opportunities out there now

8955956 made his mark literally from day one reaching across the aisle to pass legislation to secure the worlds deadliest weapons
8955957 to pass a law that helps keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists
8955958 but i was proudest i was proudest when i watched him spontaneously focus the attention of the nation on the shameful neglect of americas wounded warriors at walter reed army hospital

8956021 this is no ordinary time this is no ordinary election
8956022 i want to get back to playing football with city and doing the best i can
8956023 im glad to be given the opportunity to help the club move forward
8956024 i cant say i ever felt i was truly not wanted when i was at the club chelsea it is a fantastic club fantastic fans
8956025 i can say i gave 110 per cent for them like i always would but i am glad now to leave what was a great experience and try and get to work at home
8956026 from my point of view i am absolutely delighted he is key to what we are trying to do we need to attract top quality players and that is certainly what shaun is
8956027 we have got great plans it is a huge project we are trying to get off the floor here and the need for quality players was obvious this is the start of a great journey we hope
8956028 i believe it is possible to go back and be successful and i have no doubt shaun will be successful here he is coming back a better player he is older wiser and more experienced
8956029 they have talked to me about the 4 4 game not the carling cup one mistake in the last two minutes meant they lost the premier league
8956030 they also told me they respected some of the tottenham players and at this moment it is important for tottenham not to lose another game
8956031 they want their first three points in the league so we have some problems we know this we need to respect them even more
8956032 if you win a derby it is fantastic when i arrived here some people said to me you need to win three derbies tottenham fulham and west ham
8956033 they said we didnt need to win against the other teams but for me i need to win all the other games against wigan manchester city everyone
8956034 in the last game one or two players played because they wanted to help chelsea but this time it is impossible for one player to play because he feels his foot more than before
8956035 maybe i will be without more than one player if they cannot train tomorrow i will need one or two players to switch position because my midfielders have injuries
8956036 tottenham thought they would have a better start to the season than they have done because they have lost both games
8956037 but i know juande and the players at tottenham they made one or two mistakes in the games before ours but we need to remember this is a big chance for tottenham because it is a derby
8956038 i know more about them than you might think because 11 portuguese players are there when i was in charge of the portugal national team every week i had news about cluj
8956039 id always thought writing a memoir was a really stupid idea it was clich d a way of commodifying the addiction
8956040 ralph finally tired of the game and pulled up with the window open i got the jump on him pulled him through the window and before he knew what happened he was face down in the flower bed in front of the country club donald and i got in the town car and drove away back at the hotel there was a knock at the door there was ralph chest heaving dirt still on his tux wielding a butter knife of all things by the time hotel security got there ralph was working me over and i was upside down against an adjoining hotel room door i did not fare well my hand was fractured my head was lolling to port and i had a limp
8956041 it is immediately clear from doolies recollection that there were times when i hunted her down you hit me and somehow you pushed me down do you mind if i do this she asked as she put her hands on my shoulders it might be kind of pathetic but you had me on each shoulder and you were hitting me back and forth and were saying im going to kill you every word of it was true i had done these things
8956042 you had me on each shoulder and you were hitting me back and forth and were saying im going to kill you every word of it was true i had done these things
8956043 i did not so much move in with anna as suddenly become someone who did not leave i treated her as an atm using her drugs and money almost at will while she seemed more than willing to make the trade in spite of the fact that i was the one who stepped up and raised our children who shook off the life there are times when the moral high ground rests with her i hit her for one thing for another whatever she did she did out of a kind of love my presence in her life was far more mercenary
8956044 i was born in a really nice suburb i went to a good school and had a really nice family i had every opportunity and a million second chances i lived when a lot of my good friends died i have a really good job now and a family that i like how bad should you feel for that guy
8956045 set out to become a nice suburban alcoholic and succeeded
8956046 barring a necessary and opposing force the obsession that lives in an addict is always in the basement doing push ups waiting for an opening and all the treasure human and otherwise will not change that math thats why reading all the junkie memoirs that ridicule various programs of recovery makes me laugh
8956047 free will moderation a flash of self realization followed by a lifetime of self control
8956048 you are always told to recover for yourself but the only way i got my head out of my own ass was to remember that there were other asses to consider
8956049 i now inhabit a life i dont deserve but we all walk this earth feeling we are frauds the trick is to be grateful and hope the caper doesnt end any time soon
8956050 were gonna hold on to em by the nose and were gonna kick em in the ass
8956051 im gonna get down on my knees and beg that girl to marry me
8956052 it is with profound gratitude and great humility that i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8956053 he has to give reassurance that he knows how important women are in our society
8956054 really articulate the kind of change he wants to make and not just say we cant have more of the same
8956055 a lot of people say they want more specifics but i dont think tonight is the time for that
8956056 this will not be the i have a dream speech
8956057 but i do have a dream that this man becomes the next president of the united states
8956058 but a year ago last fall i went to obamas campaign headquarters and i felt like i was 8 years old again
8956059 that conversation will not happen between him and a white person
8956060 white people like me are the ones who will have to do some of the work

8956063 but most of the people who are actually in town for the rnc have stuff they have to do for the rnc in a lot of ways theyre the people were least likely to get just because of their schedules
8956064 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive obama told nearly 80 000 people at denvers invesco field as he accepted the democratic partys presidential nomination
8956065 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8956066 obamas rhetorical extravagances are inversely proportional to his details as when he promises nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy in order to end the age of oil
8956067 in making promises he has to be careful to avoid endorsing programs that could be interpreted as irresponsible acts of tax and spend liberalism
8956068 he should avoid anything that appears to require new taxes or that appears to send a lot of money to inner cities
8956069 the men and women who gathered there could have heard many things
8956070 they could have heard words of anger and discord they could have been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred but what people heard instead people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked
8956071 as an attempt to prevent the wide disparities in wealth income and power that are undermining the promise of american democracy
8956072 by articulating a positive picture of a unified america this theme also has the virtue of directly addressing voters fears about his favoring african americans over whites
8956073 yes mccain needs to break sharply with the incumbent administration on key issues but he would also benefit greatly if bush could raise his abysmal 30 percent positive rating to a somewhat more palpable figure in the high 30s or even 40 percent
8956074 that will make their speeches relatively short and get them the hell off the minnesota stage faster
8956075 the temptation will be for the republicans to keep lambasting obama because it has seemed to work until now
8956076 but without a compelling positive vision of change on domestic issues which they have largely so far failed to provide the republicans cant win
8956077 there wont be many more opportunities where you can just lie down and sleep at will

8956096 who appeared to come from across the street where the basilica of the assumption is located though they dont know if he came out of the church itself he was white and well dressed in his thirties and stared at the display before leaving the range of the camera where he picked up a rock from construction and threw it at the window this doesnt seem to be a random act of vandalism he seemed deeply perturbed by the poster i would like to think that the catholic church with its rich colorful 2 000 years of history going straight back to jesus need not be threatened by a history book

8956130 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff members
8956131 we have had two offers for separate players this week one for 5m and another at 4m
8956132 we have discussed the two offers at boardroom level and unanimously turned them down
8956133 the key factor is that our manager dave jones wants to keep this squad together and believes we will challenge for promotion
8956134 the board decision was to back the manager 100 per cent our stance on offers for key players remains unchanged none of them will be sold at any price
8956135 we have had bids for our players but we dont have to sell we are in a position whereby we can turn down the bids

8956142 because of our overwhelming regard for coach tressels contributions to ohio state and our football program we made a commitment toward keeping him no 1 in the big ten and among the top ranks of coaches nationally and this revision achieves that goal

8956150 we definitely wont leave the government house until we can topple samaks administration

8956160 last year it was at midnight and we are ready to stay up all night this time if it is needed
8956161 for a while they all talk the talk and nothing happens then in the last four or five days every half an hour there is a headline saying someone has signed somewhere
8956162 big yogis his own man hes made his peace but i dont need counselling and i havent been offered a meeting in any case
8956163 the most interesting comment john made was when he said he knew his face had been shown on a screen after mine during the referees meeting
8956164 today i felt nervous at the beginning and then it went away
8956165 i am not thinking about anything right now just enjoying the moment
8956166 this is very disappointing to me but something i have to accept
8956167 i never saw her play before so i didnt know what to expect
8956168 i know for a fact that i havent been given the nod
8956169 im disgusted that people players media would think that nick faldo would be that unprofessional
8956170 its pathetic that people can even think thats the case
8956171 nicks a professional hes been a professional the last 30 years of his career and hes not going to start changing now
8956172 i told him basically that my decision is to stay here and play and i got the best answer i could have possibly got off a captain which was youve got to do whats right for you
8956173 throw shit against the wall and see how much sticks
8956174 we have a unique combination of unlimited scenic views unlimited blacktop and very little vehicle traffic
8956175 to argue with a man who has renounced his reason is like giving medicine to the dead
8956176 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration
8956177 best known for her advocacy of drilling drilling for oil in anwr in the state of alaska
8956178 to argue with a man who has renounced his reason is like giving medicine to the dead
8956179 the greatest happiness is to scatter your enemy to drive him before you to see his cities reduced to ashes to see those who love him shrouded in tears and to gather into your bosom his wives and daughters
8956180 so what are you gonna do about it home slice
8956181 to argue with a man who has renounced his reason is like giving medicine to the dead

8956184 the game will never be forgotten because it was such a close finish
8956185 we got put in in bowling friendly conditions and made a moderate total of 191 hastings then had a good spell with the bat in reply and looked like winners until that fantastic last over
8956186 i kept my leg problem from everyone it was badly bruised i wanted to play so i could bowl my nine overs at the home of cricket to win the way we did finding those three wickets in the final over was just a very special moment
8956187 the boys were so close and going into the final over we said to each other that we hadnt disgraced ourselves and we should just go for it richard tudors 0 3 is history now
8956188 he scioscia asked me before sending him onto the field do i want to play third base or second base
8956189 i said let me play second base because i dont wear a cup
8956190 he ran in grabbed his glove and took off back out there
8956191 he looked big at second base i mean youre used to seeing small guys at second base i know you have some guys like dodgers second baseman jeff kent but juan looked a little taller and wider to see him at second base it was funny to see

8956193 the release of carbon dioxide is massive in this country
8956194 a president who ends the global scourge of aids in our time
8956195 the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
8956196 but surely we can agree that our gay brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
8956197 yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect

8956200 ask not what your country can do for you but ask what you can do for your country
8956201 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8956202 our national colours and melodious anthem echoed not just at the olympic stadium but also in million of homes across the globe you have brought fame and glory to our country
8956203 the rest of the world had written kenya off particularly after the happenings early this year now that our team has come so jubilant so successful from beijing a time like this is celebration time because it also unifies our country
8956204 they made kenyans forget tribe and party they made kenyans proud to be kenyans one nation united under one flag singing one anthem living one dream
8956205 kenya participated in just five out of the 28 disciplines in the olympics i would therefore like to challenge our sports managers to expand the number of events that kenya participates in
8956206 if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8956207 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
8956208 we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
8956209 and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8956210 we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8956211 as a follow up to my below post picking a female vp makes it very difficult for obama to execute the second part of his strategy painting mccain as the same as bush
8956212 maybe they wont notice that i am taking john mccains straight talk express campaign themes
8956213 i dont think so america knows mccain just sold out the country for a politic tactical stunt the woman has no experience on diversity of economics no national experience with any issue if the 72 year old kicks the bucket so would we as a country this woman is soooooo under qualified
8956214 now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses
8956215 ive worked this out with god and thats all i need to work it out with
8956216 minnesotas a nice place i was born and raised here ive always opened my doors to everybody and im hoping the city will continue to open its doors to people even if they dont have a credit card to stay at the w
8956217 no one ive ever talked to has been able to put into words the sensation of skydiving
8956218 freefall is such a stupendous sense of freedom you are flying through the air able to move your body in 3d you can fly forward back up move sideways speed up how fast you are falling and slow down how fast you are falling yes you are continually falling but during that time you are definitely flying your body you can do flips and twists you can stand on your feet or stand on your head there are absolutely no limits as to which direction you can move your body
8956219 that you must no longer live as the gentiles do in the futility of their thinking
8956220 have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity with a continual lust for more
8956221 did not come to know christ that way surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in jesus
8956222 expend our energies admiring exploring expositing and extolling jesus christ
8956223 kind and compassionate to one another forgiving each other just as in christ god forgave you
8956224 if you think you are standing firm be careful that you dont fall
8956225 and pursue righteousness faith love and peace along with those who call on the lord out of a pure heart
8956226 means you continually face up to your own sinfulness and then flee to jesus through faith in his shed blood and righteousness
8956227 hey self listen up this is what matters most youre forgiven your have hope your hope is based on the sacrifice of jesus so lets not view this day any other way let this day be governed by this one defining truth
8956228 worldly wisdom recommends the path of compromise and talks of moderation
8956229 according to this carnal policy purity is admitted to be very desirable but we are warned against being too precise
8956230 through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well thats why i stand here tonight because for 232 years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8956231 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8956232 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8956233 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8956234 you have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming because ive seen it because ive lived it
8956235 i always dreamed id be standing next to my friend former denver broncos player floyd little
8956236 one of the greatest gifts of our democracy is the opportunity it offers us every four years to change our course
8956237 its not a guarantee its an opportunity we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama president of the united states of america
8956238 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8956239 why is this election so close well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion
8956240 i think the forces of the status quo are afraid of the change barack obama represents
8956241 his obamas experience has taught him something that career politicians often over look that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governments
8956242 john mccain is the first candidate in history who thinks he can win by telling voters theyre not thinking for themselves
8956243 lets be honest america john mccain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes but were the ones that will pay for his flip flops
8956244 america faces a simple choice do we want more of the same or is it time to change america
8956245 se decreta fijar la fecha del referendo nacional constituyente dirimitorio y aprobatorio para el 7 de diciembre de 2008
8956246 es un d a hist rico porque el decreto garantiza la aprobaci n de la nueva constituci n
8956247 estamos entrando a la recta final y aqu nueva constituci n se encuentran las demandas de todos los sectores sociales el sacrificio de todos los bolivianos
8956248 ahora el soberano podr elegir democr ticamente sobre qu modelo de estado prefiere
8956249 el nuevo modelo de estado es incluyente participativo nuestra nueva constituci n nos ofrece eso
8956250 su autoconfianza sale muy reforzada que es lo importante para que sigan en el sistema educativo el programa se desarrolla en los propios centros fuera del horario escolar y normalmente con los profesores del colegio haciendo clases de refuerzo

8956254 voluntad de reforzar las relaciones entre la uni n europea y georgia
8956255 were corrupting more and more people to care about this stuff
8956256 the question for the american people is whether they can make this odyssey that democratic delegates to the convention made seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
8956257 la colaboraci n de todos y la protecci n institucional
8956258 s lo un ejemplo del estado de abandono del patrimonio mar timo en toda galicia
8956259 in four short years bush turned that around and we now have debt for years to come
8956260 right now we need to campaign on turning virginia from a red state to a blue state
8956261 im talking to people every day who were republicans forever but are just not able to do it this year
8956262 for years and years they bought the plan to cut taxes but the middle class now is beginning to catch up with that idea and understand that a trick has been pulled on them
8956263 i want to vote for somebody who is going to deliver what he says he is going to do
8956264 forget about the wealthy think about the people and help the middle class rather than the wealthy
8956265 we have got a good start but we have our work cut out for us all across the country
8956266 we need to bring the lost to the light and reap the harvest
8956267 this election if probably one of the most important of my grandchildrens lives
8956268 i think historically we have left behind the disadvantaged and the people the policy was developed for
8956269 i think obama has done things more than any candidate to reach out to my generation
8956270 compare that to john mccain who said he barely knew how to use the internet and had to have help from his wife
8956271 the campaign of barack obama and joe biden is a very exciting one
8956272 we want a change that is going to help us all
8956273 their strength is not only how they campaign but how they govern
8956274 sees the fundamental cause of the worlds problems in the very expansion of homo sapiens
8956275 already concerned about her break up with john mayer overshadowing her movie so the last thing she wants is another ex in the picture
8956276 its inconvenient having to duck and dive but more than anything she finds it embarrassing
8956277 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8956278 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8956279 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8956280 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
8956281 if they asked me id say spend your time in ohio or some of these other states where its going to be very close
8956282 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8956283 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8956284 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8956285 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8956286 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8956287 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8956288 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8956289 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
8956290 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
8956291 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8956292 the five senators alan cranston d ca dennis deconcini d az john glenn d oh john mccain r az and donald w
8956293 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 8 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
8956294 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
8956295 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
8956296 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8956297 weve had thousands die in the first few years and mccain wants to keep it up for 100 more years
8956298 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
8956299 so long as they are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8956300 as legendas podem ajudar as pessoas que n o entenderiam o udio do v deo especialmente quem fala outros idiomas ou que s o surdos ou t m problemas auditivos
8956301 the next six months are going to tell the story
8956302 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8956303 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8956304 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8956305 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
8956306 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
8956307 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year

8956341 the developer says that the ps3 xbox 360 and pc versions have been developed from the same core build so theyll all share the same features
8956342 while we didnt see the ps3 version its claimed that the aliasing on sonys machine outperforms that of the 360 while on the pc its all dependent on the specifications of your machine
8956343 i keep looking at my life and wonder why im not dead yet
8956344 can i shoot jack thompson now i been practicing on counter strike source
8956345 a dream that will come true is not a real dream
8956346 my father just literally died in my arms i notified all my kids and my lawyer notified dinas attorney lets see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral this will show her true colours thus not even a call but thats par for the course with dina she didnt even send a card or visit when he was sick
8956347 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8956348 when he walks out onstage tonight in front of 75 000 to 80 000 people hes a very tangible symbol of whats at stake in a presidential election
8956349 anyone who looks at al gore and whats happened over the last eight years knows whats at stake
8956350 im leaning obama but im still mad its a childish mad but there it is
8956351 i wasnt going to let my disappointment stand in the way of being at what is an historic event
8956352 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8956353 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome
8956354 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8956355 we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8956356 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
8956357 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8956358 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8956359 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
8956360 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8956361 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8956362 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
8956363 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
8956364 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8956365 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8956366 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8956367 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity and some assumed we would continue with both no matter the outcome but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8956368 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous with john mccains support president bush and vice president cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to facts their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short circuit the rule of law
8956369 we plan to take them with us we do not know what we will expect at sea we have had indications that israel might stop us but we know full well that the palestinians that are coming with us have the right papers have the right visas and they should be allowed to travel there is no reason why israel is holding them hostage holding them prisoners in gaza and denying them medical attention denying them education denying them family reunification
8956370 the suspicion would arise that someone in the us created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates they needed a small victorious war
8956371 we are in the process of re evaluating our relationship with russia and we are doing that in concert with our international partners such as france but also many others including germany and all of the nato countries its premature to say i dont know what ultimately will result from the process that people are going to discuss what the consequences may be
8956372 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8956373 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8956374 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
8956375 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8956376 i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
8956377 ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america
8956378 ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
8956379 and ill invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8956380 both candidates are talking about energy high prices and global warming so its important to look past the rhetoric and see what is at the heart of their plans
8956381 as this scorecard illustrates the contrast in this election could not be starker
8956382 barack obama wants to give tax relief and 1 000 energy rebates to working families while john mccain wants billions more in tax breaks for oil companies making more than 1 000 a second in profits
8956383 thats why i came here tonight to tell you why i feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama president of the united states of america
8956384 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8956385 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of humankind
8956386 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
8956387 many scientists predict shockingly that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months during the first term of the next president
8956388 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions
8956389 in spite of john mccains past record of open mindedness and leadership on the climate crisis he has now apparently allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution
8956390 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
8956391 that america is the best country on earth and a place where everybody if they work hard can achieve great things
8956392 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8956393 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8956394 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8956395 if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope
8956396 i went on a trip to europe with my father and mother
8956397 and everywhere we went we were met by vast crowds of people hundreds of thousands of people who came out into the street because they wanted to be near to an american politician and it wasnt because his brother had been martyred three years before
8956398 our nation was the most loved nation on the face of the earth because we were regarded as an exemplary nation
8956399 it took 230 years of discipline restraint and visionary leadership by republican and democratic presidents to build up those vast reservoirs of love and adoration for the united states for the past seven years through monumental arrogance and incompetence we have drained those reservoirs dry anyone who thinks its good for our country when hezbollah is more popular in the middle east than the us has their head in an oil well
8956400 his life has been the 21st century incarnation of the american dream
8956401 im not angry at the canadiens organization anymore rejean houle has called a few times and told me im welcome any time but im not comfortable with it
8956402 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8956403 for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy
8956404 i wish i could fellate the dead corpse of ronald reagan
8956405 and if i had not been a self righteous jackass with a tragic sense of entitlement for the presidency that led me to blissfully ignore the threat of candidacy i couldve been legitimately elected and
8956406 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels
8956407 those who would sacrifice their liberty for a little more security deserve neither
8956408 free market which is never free and seldom even a market in any recognizeable sense of the word
8956409 for all sad words of tongue and pen the saddest are these it might have been
8956410 free market which is never free and seldom even a market in any recognizeable sense of the word
8956411 more recently she has come under the scrutiny of an investigation by the republican controlled legislature into the possibility that she ordered the dismissal of alaskas public safety commissioner because he would not fire her former brother in law as a state trooper
8956412 her husband is todd palin an oil production operator on alaskas north slope
8956413 this country needs someone with his intelligence honesty and values
8956414 i feel strongly that this country needs to change direction
8956415 sportsmen have been stereotyped as concerned with one issue guns but if you listen to sportsmen as i have over the years we hear a different story
8956416 democrats are all about conservation they are all about preservation i think thats a huge opportunity
8956417 with sen obama you have a lifetime record of supporting gun control voting for gun control speaking out against gun rights and voting against gun rights either as an elected official or a private citizen
8956418 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8956419 hes a player in an ideal world you would not want to lose but i just want to make it absolutely clear that at the end of the day it was my decision to sell him
8956420 we got an offer that i feel was his value we are all aware james has had a difficult time he almost signed for them once before two years ago while on loan and was dragged back
8956421 but he has always behaved impeccably hes a fantastic professional and theres no doubt about it theyve got an outstanding player and we have got to move on
8956422 and michael owen reportedly beeing offered a one year deal for 85k a year
8956423 i dont know how about not either give the ball away or dribble all the way back to midfield whenever he recieves a pass not handle the ball everytime he drops back in defense
8956424 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8956425 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8956426 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8956427 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
8956428 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
8956429 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
8956430 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
8956431 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
8956432 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
8956433 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
8956434 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
8956435 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
8956436 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
8956437 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8956438 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8956439 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8956440 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8956441 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8956442 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8956443 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8956444 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8956445 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8956446 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8956447 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8956448 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8956449 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8956450 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8956451 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8956452 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8956453 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8956454 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8956455 im the one im the one who wears mens underwear
8956456 i have a few songs ive started on my piano at home a little more introspective i cant wait to get home and focus on my songwriting i have so much in me
8956457 i have a song i wrote when i was 15 and lived in napanee that im going to possibly put on this next album you
8956458 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8956459 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8956460 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8956461 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8956462 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8956463 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8956464 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8956465 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8956466 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8956467 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8956468 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8956469 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8956470 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8956471 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8956472 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8956473 space based solar power as an opportunity for strategic security
8956474 the lunar infrastructure as proposed by the late gerard k oneill is well thought out
8956475 lastly i wanted to say that these figures are based on current residential demand
8956476 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8956477 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8956478 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8956479 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8956480 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8956481 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8956482 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8956483 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8956484 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8956485 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8956486 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8956487 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8956488 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8956489 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8956490 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
8956491 i was worried this year because i know the economy has affected everything
8956492 but weve actually picked up new money winchester is committed to this festival many of our non profit and civic groups set up exhibits that weekend but those groups are also the work force
8956493 i use one of the church groups to pick up trash i use the football boosters to load and unload the sound equipment the rescue squad helps with parking we actually have a waiting list of people to come on board and help
8956494 winchester is not a tourist destination its kind of a pass by people are either going to boonesborough or the mountain parkway or further down interstate 64 as far as having a captive audience this is it for us
8956495 we plan year to year but realize things happen that we cant control with the economy and the local music scene
8956496 our philosophy is always the same we try to improve the lineup improve the event by making positive changes and keep the ticket price down
8956497 but people are having a tough time i think they would like to know that the folks promoting events realize it might not be as easy for an audience with gas prices this year to spend a lot of money so if people decide to stay home or at least closer to home can we provide a quality event where they feel basically like theyve been on vacation thats what were charged with
8956498 i was really saddened by the closing of the dame
8956499 but by the same token today is now the day somebody is thinking about opening a new venue the only thing sure about the future is its sure to change
8956500 we had goose creek symphony down here about four years ago
8956501 we learned a lot from that it wasnt a financial success but the community got involved plus the people that were there absolutely loved the setting since then they have wanted to do something else there and now is certainly the time
8956502 these songwriters dont deal with the cookie cutter music that comes down the pike
8956503 just about any open space that can hold 100 or more people
8956504 now that the dames gone thats even more evident to people
8956505 but when i started doing this it was more of an inward thing really i was in a band at the time and no one was booking us so i started doing it then i started seeing how strong the music community in lexington was i thoroughly believed in it
8956506 were working on some stuff at the red mile thats going to be pretty cool
8956507 weve got to keep a lot of it under wraps for now but its going to be pretty awesome
8956508 and now hes consistently back there so its a funny game
8956509 in which he describes initially meeting and working with hinckley after the pitcher found my web site and contacted me last september 2007 with two goals in mind 1 to increase his throwing velocity and 2 to get bigger and stronger
8956510 for 4 months mike followed the program i designed for him he put on 23 lbs increasing his weight from178 to 201 lbs training with weighted baseballs his fastball increased from 87 to 91 mph hinckley also worked diligently on his pitching mechanics under the watchful eye of his father david hinckley the head baseball coach at moore high school near ok city
8956511 plaintiffs suggestion that veoh must be required to reduce or limit its business operations is contrary to one of the stated goals of the dmca
8956512 the dmca was intended to facilitate the growth of electronic commerce not squelch it
8956513 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services
8956514 even if the veoh decision were to be considered by other courts that case does nothing to change the fact that youtube is a business built on infringement that has failed to take reasonable measures to respect the rights of creators and content owners google and youtube have engaged in massive copyright infringement conduct that is not protected by any law including the dmca
8956515 veoh is not precluded from safe harbor by virtue of its automated processing of user submitted content
8956516 viacom unlike io has been sending tons of section 512 takedown notices to youtube the question there is going to be what does youtube have to do after it gets those notices other than just pulling down the one file thats complained about
8956517 perhaps most importantly there is no indication that veoh has failed to police its system to the fullest extent permitted by its architecture
8956518 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile
8956519 questa lunica cosa per cui nessuno dei due pu essere perdonato il anyone else youve
8956520 full of meaning and full of opportunity and if you as i believe and i know a lot of you do we did not lose the last election nor did al gore lose his last election we won it
8956521 ill screw around on my sick wife and make her lie in front of the cameras about it
8956522 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8956523 barry goldwater ran for president and he lost mo udall ran for president and he lost bruce babbit ran for president and he lost for this next election thats one arizona political tradition id like to see continue
8956524 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush more than 90 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8956525 i will always call him governor bush because thats the last political office he was legitimately elected to
8956526 and it is now under investion they were fixed computors
8956527 there are too many republican robber barons in this nation and they exist and survive vy the use of the worst deceptive practices and tactics paying out to those whod sell their souls to put their republican puppet in the white house to enrich themselves and destroy america and its middle class and its working population these robber barons need to be crushed to a pulp to save america and its leadership in the world
8956528 fewer believe that those provided the margin of victory or that kerry was robbed of victory the way democrats think gore was robbed
8956529 it was definitely the longest speech ive seen him do and he did pull on a lot of heart strings
8956530 i would have liked to seen it more fact based but hes definitely leadership material
8956531 im a bit of an environmentalist so i really enjoy his movies and lectures he is a tad full of himself though
8956532 i really enjoyed governor schweitzer of montanas speech because he seems very down to earth
8956533 i really enjoyed hillarys speech as well talking about how her campaign and baracks campaign are about helping others it was really classy
8956534 he got over his personal conflicts with obama and stepped up and did what was right for the party and the country in typical bill clinton fashion
8956535 this election has never been about me its about you
8956536 its a moment in our history that well never forget
8956537 most times people are offering thousands of dollars to get out of politicians speeches
8956538 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
8956539 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders
8956540 i knew abe abe was a friend of mine and baracks no lincoln
8956541 senator i knew abe lincoln abe lincoln was friend of mine senator youre no abe lincoln
8956542 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
8956543 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
8956544 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
8956545 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
8956546 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
8956547 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8956548 involved engaged and getting briefings and working to make sure that the federal assistance is there
8956549 now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
8956550 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
8956551 if the rapist was a migrant we fear he may well have already gone possibly to england or to another french port its also possible hes gone to belgium or the netherlands
8956552 conditions in the camp are very hard the occupants sole aim is to secure their passage to britain
8956553 you have to be very careful when entering these camps the people there mostly men have an illegal status they have no job and no home the jungle is a dangerous place and its not safe to go there
8956554 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8956555 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8956556 i am truly disappointed and disturbed to learn that a member of this administration contacted the department of public safety regarding trooper wooten
8956557 at no time did i authorize any member of my staff to do so
8956558 that promotes the conservation and efficient recovery of domestic oil and natural gas resources while protecting health safety and the environment
8956559 education and workforce development public health and safety and transportation and infrastructure development
8956560 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them
8956561 i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
8956562 they are doing well but they still need a lot of care
8956563 what they need most is a dwelling to live in i hope the government will give them an apartment
8956564 taken the first steps in the state of florida toward legally changing his last name to ocho cinco
8956565 daddy i want to be called xontar the andromeda galaxys prince of pounding
8956566 gov crist now has an opportunity to make a lasting impact on the florida supreme court much like president bush has been able to do on the u s supreme court
8956567 hell be able to pick people who reflect his judgment and his conservative principles
8956568 theres no better way to accentuate your beliefs than with appointments to the court
8956569 this has not been a partisan court if i thought we were getting ideologues on the court id be concerned
8956570 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
8956571 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
8956572 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
8956573 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
8956574 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned
8956575 who arent doing smart things that they should or are doing daft things they shouldnt
8956576 point 4 the palestinians get properly organized and stop being so silly and the israelis cease acting like jerks
8956577 the erratic nature of this release is exemplified by the sharp increase in orders and the contrasting weakness seen in employment
8956578 chicago pmi was much firmer than expected bringing in more sellers into a rather thin market the breakdown looks good with new orders up almost seven points
8956579 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8956580 the carbon based interests oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for everything its worth
8956581 some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
8956582 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
8956583 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
8956584 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
8956585 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
8956586 he seems to be in very good condition and when he is fit and healthy he is always a candidate for the national team
8956587 no no jimmy stewart for governor ronald reagan for best friend
8956588 strongly consider termination for byington classroom teacher doyle schultz and supervisor david boggan
8956589 the chief minister has been censured by the politburo for his anti bandh stand and he has not opposed it and accepted the decision
8956590 i do not support any bandh but at the same time i am member of a political party so long i have kept mum but now i will speak out
8956591 most conventions historically produce a bounce just the focused media attention on one side and none on the other produces a bounce
8956592 when it doesnt occur thats really the thing to make note of
8956593 a mans health can be judged by which he takes two at a time pills or stairs
8956594 dankzij die baanrace was ik optimaal voorbereid op dit bochtige parkoers
8956595 together you have made groups one of the top features on linkedin
8956596 were confident that these new features will spur communication promote collaboration and make your group more valuable to you and your members we hope you can come by linkedin on friday morning to check out the new functionality and get a group discussion going by posting a welcome message
8956597 het is jammer dat ik de volledige groep pas een week bij elkaar heb maar ze maakten een sterke indruk op me
8956598 the community has been more diverse and expansive than i imagined before i moved here
8956599 theres a range of literature being performed sarah ruhl martin mcdonagh tracy letts i originally thought those are the playwrights i will bring to dallas but you were already doing them
8956600 directing a musical is 10 percent creativity and 90 percent organizing the troops
8956601 theres a small narrative thread its all told in an abstract way
8956602 it has an immense youthful energy its loud real rock n roll the idea after 50 years of putting a rock band on the stage of the kalita humphreys and blowing the roof off the place was irresistible to me
8956603 clearly my goal is to engage a cross section of the community to see a play not to send people running away but what will draw a necessarily diverse people must be dynamic fresh new and relevant safe boring irrelevant theater thats the equivalent of warm applesauce at every meal if we do that theres no reason to exist as an institution
8956604 we are at a transformational point in our history and we know that its happening we have to produce plays people have to come to and see because they are once in a lifetime opportunities signature pieces you can only see here
8956605 love it or hate it but you will walk saying ive never seen that before
8956606 the who never meant for tommy to be performed by actors on a stage so clearly it demands interpretation
8956607 great actors playing great roles actors need to reflect our community not all white nor all black not all gay nor all straight but each of those
8956608 its equally important to me that we approach the classic texts i imagine well do a shakespeare or a rodgers amp hammerstein i could spend the rest of my career doing those two
8956609 dallas likes an event in our fashion in our civic dialogue in our arts
8956610 its difficult not to get excited when the announcement is made by peter pan
8956611 its not as many as weve had in the past but im very satisfied with the number we have planning to attend
8956612 im very satisfied with the people who will be there because those are all people who do significantly support diversity in our community
8956613 we dont ask why or what the reason is we think that the presence or absence speaks for itself as far as the parade attendance goes
8956614 the simple fact unfortunately is that in this political climate a great percentage of our community wont know one from the other anyway
8956615 i try very hard to not make this a political event it is a day of celebration for the community we welcome those that come and we hope everyone has a good time
8956616 alaska needs to be self sufficient she says instead of relying heavily on federal dollars as the state does today
8956617 a great and rare story of how adherence to principle especially to transparency and accountability in government can produce political success

8956653 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8956654 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8956655 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8956656 i get it i realize that im not the likeliest candidate for this office
8956657 one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8956658 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8956659 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8956660 for those of us who stood on the steps of the lincoln memorial or who in the years that followed may have lost hope this moment is a testament to the power and vision of martin luther king jr
8956661 it is a testament to the ability of a committed and determined people to make a difference in our society it is a testament to the promise of america
8956662 the number of problems both at home and abroad are more significant and i think the desire for a change new leadership and a new vision is needed now more than ever
8956663 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8956664 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8956665 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8956666 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
8956667 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger
8956668 after they wrecked our economy its time for a change
8956669 after they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us its time for a change
8956670 powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8956671 barack obamas vision and his voice represent the best of america
8956672 it is that common american identity which barack obama exemplifies heart and soul that enables us as americans to speak with moral authority to all of the people of the world
8956673 do not condemn the judgment of another because it differs from your own you may both be wrong
8956674 the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated

8956676 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8956677 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8956678 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8956679 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8956680 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8956681 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8956682 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8956683 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
8956684 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job

8956737 only three years after hurricanes katrina and rita devastated gulf of mexico oil and gas production an emerging hurricane storm is tracking another potentially lethal swath through americas energy heartland
8956738 and with both oil and gasoline inventories much lower than when katrina and rita hit the price consequences could be even worse this time
8956739 a multi year and now likely irreversible decline in oil production from the region
8956740 we will have some damage from this i dont think it will be long lasting

8956751 sen obama this is truly a good day for america how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8956752 the reagan era is over and a new era is about to begin
8956753 in the meantime while on the look out ill be hoping for a more compassionate government from the next president
8956754 i dont know what i despise more ageism of all kinds
8956755 because you must be 18 to enlist 18 is a suitable minimum voting age
8956756 also i assume a president can exercise compassion without defying the constitution
8956757 gee why do we let them vote shouldnt we screen the registration system so only the intelligent and deserving dont worry john im sure youd make the cut are able to cast ballots
8956758 first of all your little plan of only letting smart educated people vote is going to backfire since polls show that more educated people overwhelmingly back obama
8956759 shame on you for assuming that younger people dont take the time to learn the issues and are just swayed by a charismatic man and shame on you for thinking you are better than us just because you are older and here i was always taught we were all created equal
8956760 only a moron would utter such words shame on you for being so dumb and ruining democracy for everyone else
8956761 we came late so we wouldnt have a line and we havent had a line yet
8956762 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
8956763 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world

8956779 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight years is enough
8956780 let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
8956781 im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8956782 i dont believe senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8956783 why else would he define middle class as someone making under us5 million a year
8956784 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8956785 hes now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them

8957075 normally residents of northern bihar are prepared for kosis fury boats are available in villages when rains come people keep few assets in houses but this time after some 125 years kosi entered new areas nobody was expecting kosi to maroon them
8957076 we never expected floods in these areas right now lakhs of people have shifted to terraces of their buildings or to safer places within villages
8957077 people are still not ready to vacate the houses because they dont want to leave their belongings behind they have gone on higher floors or terraces
8957078 there seems to be slackness on both sides it seems that even the mandatory repair work was not done
8957079 the team of engineers from bihar found that villagers of the surrounding areas were sitting on an embankment to save their own lives and refused to move out or allow the indian team to conduct repair work the embankment is the only bridge over kosi so they refused to move out
8957080 actually the engineers never expected that such a big damage will follow soon
8957081 if the government of bihar had conducted regular repair work in the dry season this calamity could have been averted
8957082 nepali government should have been more helpful in helping repairs before august 16
8957083 a query against a clustered table wont always scan the clustered index even when it does the scan isnt necessarily ordered one reason is that the query may be executed in parallel over multiple processors which then merge their results another is that the optimizer may choose to perform an unordered scan using the index allocation map rather than scanning the leaf pages in order
8957084 sql server does not use that logic when returning the resultset sql server always returns the resultset which it can return fastest in most of the cases the resultset which can be returned fastest is the resultset which is returned using clustered index
8957085 there are few incidence i have observed that when parallelism is used to return the query results many times due to different speed and work load on different cpu the resultset is not according to clustered index sql server parametrization and sql server cache can return the results which are not built by clustered index

8957168 it is beyond question that by acting in the way that he did mr khan killed mr brown unlawfully and whatever their differences the fact is that mr brown lost his life that is a consequence for which mr khan must be punished with a significant custodial sentence
8957169 what became obvious as the evidence unfolded however is that from time to time despite denials to the contrary both mr brown and his son ashley barker were involved in acts of racial aggression towards members of mr khans family

8957186 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8957187 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
8957188 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
8957189 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
8957190 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
8957191 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
8957192 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8957193 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8957194 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
8957195 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche

8957197 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

8957202 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8957203 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8957204 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8957205 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
8957206 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8957207 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia

8957217 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial
8957218 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8957219 esta situaci n se alan sucede porque carabineros act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche

8957221 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche que result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta situaci n desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia

8957236 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece

8957238 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8957239 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo

8957247 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad

8957249 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
8957250 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8957251 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8957252 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8957253 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
8957254 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8957255 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones

8957275 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8957276 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8957277 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8957278 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8957279 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8957280 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

8957297 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

8957366 this isnt just about cutting down on the number of squirrels killed on the roads we also know that when a natural habitat becomes fragmented such as by the introduction of unnatural barriers like roads there is a lesser chance of the species surviving in the long term because the opportunities for breeding are fewer the bridges hopefully encourage the squirrels to explore a wider area and therefore lessen the chance of inbreeding by finding out whether they actually use these bridges we can assess how useful it is to install them
8957367 an snh grant for rope bridges was successfully applied for by the local community of strachur and two have been erected across the main road there but we needed to find out how cost effective they were before spending any more money putting them up at other sites when we looked into it we were surprised to discover that no one has ever really tested the efficiency of these bridges the research that stephen from the university of leeds has now carried out should help us make our case when we apply for funding for future projects
8957368 in areas where there is a high population of squirrels then the new bridges we put up were being used within a couple of days not surprisingly we also found that baiting the bridges with food also encouraged the squirrels to use them this kind of information has never been collected before and it could now be used by other wildlife conservation groups or even by developers when considering plans for new road building projects that cut through squirrel habitat
8957369 our masters programme in biodiversity and conservation provides us with an opportunity to conduct the kind of research that could have a real impact on british wildlife this project is just one example
8957370 since the nineteen seventies vigorous technical debates have been in progress regarding the function of plasma which however have not led to any conclusive results in particular we do not fully understand the exact energy coupling mechanism

8957372 electron resonance can even be controlled specifically to initiate the mechanism

8957379 the choice of contributors was deliberate because were hoping to keep the service as low cost as possible so it will remain sustainable

8957381 our ice breaking research vessel polarstern is currently on a scientific mission in the arctic ocean departing from iceland the route has taken the ship through the northwest passage into the canadian basin where geophysical and geological studies will be carried out along profiles into the makarov basin to study the tectonic history and submarine geology of the central arctic ocean in addition oceanographic as well as biological studies will be carried out polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
8957382 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
8957383 at awi we place particular emphasis on studying arctic sea ice and along with in situ studies of sea ice thickness change satellite data have been used extensively not only for the regular observation of changes in the arctic and antarctic but also for optimising the operation of polarstern in regions covered by sea ice
8957384 once developed this molecule will cause much less wheezing and shortness of breath and should be able to be given safely to the hundreds of thousands of patients with both heart and lung diseases furthermore because it will have so few side effects it has the potential to become the beta blocker of choice for all heart patients
8957385 we know that beta blockers save lives in patients with heart disease so making them safe for those unlucky enough to have a respiratory disorder as well is a clinical imperative i applaud jill baker for questioning why beta blockers should remain contraindicated for so many of her patients and being stirred to correct this with an incisive programme of work in the best traditions of medical research this endeavour was born out of a problem encountered at the sharp end of clinical practice

8957400 alongside the magic of auction style sales buyers increasingly want the convenience of shopping for great value often new items at a fixed price and that is fuelling a big growth in the number of large and small sellers using ebay in this way
8957401 the improvements will remove barriers for sellers so they can make the most of this opportunity and offer even more goods for sale on ebay that means even greater choice for buyers and in turn greater success for sellers

8957406 the r type franchise has a terrific fan base and although tactics is a departure from the familiar gameplay associated with the brand it is still an r type game

8957408 in my opinion there are three titles in the early 90s that really defined video gaming mario street fighter and r type working on r type tactics is like working with a childhood hero
8957409 the sense of nostalgia you get when you see the artwork and knowing you grew up with this series is immense and great fun to work on considering the size of the fan base we expect to see steady sales throughout the christmas period and into the new year

8957419 its just like with television or films or even literature
8957420 older gamers have less interest in learning how to play new games they are more likely to stick to the brands they already know well an example of that is gran turismo which is a big hit among older gamers

8957454 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8957455 analog devices top line guidance came in a bit below wall street expectations however i think the problems are between the hudson and east rivers and not in norwood massachusetts the hometown of analog
8957456 what wall street appears to be missing is that since adi has sold off some of its lower profit business units its seasonal sales patterns have changed adi is now again driven by industrial market sectors much more than it was even just last year
8957457 therefore its conservative guidance of flat to up 3 sequentially shouldnt have been a big surprise nor a cause for concern as a matter of fact with its minimal exposure to pc and consumer markets i think flat to up 3 is pretty good
8957458 what wall street would be better to focus on are the operational improvements adi has made in its july quarter adi improved its pro forma operating margin to 26 5 from 26 2 last quarter and again reduced its inventory which sits now at the lowest level weve seen since 2004
8957459 if we look back at last year and include the results from divested businesses its operating margin was only 22
8957460 excluding those businesses in the july 2008 quarter adi reported sales of 659 million a very modest 3 decline however when we look at pro forma gross profit dollars adi generated 403 7 million in the july quarter this year versus 391 1 million last year if this is bad i want more bad
8957461 in my prior review of the stock i wrote that it was time to hold off on accumulating shares of adi due to the price appreciation we had seen from buy recommendations made earlier in 2008 i now believe its time to accumulate shares again at the current price of 28 91 and follow through to as high as 31
8957462 a phone is only as good as the network its on
8957463 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
8957464 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
8957465 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
8957466 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin

8957475 because i could jump on it and the new one isnt comfortable to lay down on
8957476 im on the same playing field as every other defenseman here
8957477 im trying to make the team and prove that i can benefit the team just as much as i hope i did last year you look around and you look at the roster and there are 16 d here every guy could be on the team you pick any eight guys and i would be confident in saying that would be one of the best d corps in the tournament next year
8957478 at the same time like you said i have a leg up on them and in a way i guess i do
8957479 its just having experience which i think is a big thing in this tournament
8957480 obviously youll take the best players but i think this group has some good size and some of the better players are pretty big kids
8957481 in order to be effective in a tournament on a nhl sheet you have to have guys that are good along the wall whether it is on the breakout or in the offensive zone and getting to the net and the areas you need to get to
8957482 its just a totally different game and you have to be able to change your game on any given night the size of a rink does make a difference especially for a guy like me a small defenseman
8957483 if were playing on an olympic sheet you cant run after guys in the corner because especially with the europeans they are too quick too shifty and they will make moves on you on the smaller rink you can close down their space and eliminate them a little easier
8957484 its something you will never forget being that close to medals and really even the gold medal
8957485 i have been a part of usa hockey for a couple of years now and even my u 18 year we lost to russia in the gold medal game and thats one that i will never forget either its completely different but at the same time its fun but looking back on the experience i wouldnt trade it for anything obviously the result wasnt what we wanted but at the same time it was a good learning experience all you can do is bottle it up and use it for the future

8957531 her2 or two key hormones estrogen and progestin which also are fundamental to many hormone based treatments for breast cancer
8957532 thats why we cant use hormonal treatments on these tumors
8957533 weve known for a long time that breast feeding reduces your risk of breast cancer and that it was probably related to hormones
8957534 one possible explanation is that while women are breast feeding they arent menstruating and so their hormones arent cycling

8957540 senator john mccain today announced that he has selected alaska governor sarah palin to be his running mate and to serve as his vice president

8957551 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and by the way john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8957552 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that sen mccain took office
8957553 lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced

8957558 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow
8957559 but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet 21st century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy

8957589 the two minute recording is stored on a microchip no bigger than a dot atop the letter i push a button on the toothbrush and a minicomputer starts playing the song sound waves are transported through the transducer to the front teeth traveling from there to the jawbone and then to the inner ear hasbro is in talks with several recording artists about getting rights to their recordings many artists would probably consider a gig in a toothbrush beneath their talents but others might welcome the daily exposure in their young fans lives

8957597 we have been talking about techniques for encoding unique identifiers in the context of gmos for some time
8957598 any development which would help in the process of detecting and identifying gmos would be welcomed
8957599 simpler techniques for access to that information will help us ensure effective traceability and labelling through the food supply chain this will ensure consumer choice and increase confidence

8957660 decrease in production or departure of one or both of the two canneries in american samoa could devastate the local economy resulting in massive layoffs and insurmountable financial difficulties
8957661 the truth is the global tuna industry is so competitive that it is no longer possible for the federal government to demand mainland minimum wage rates for american samoa without causing the collapse of our economy and making us welfare wards of the federal government
8957662 for over 50 years the federal department of labor has provided that wages in u s territories including american samoa be set by a federally appointed wage board following public hearings
8957663 the wage board takes into accounts several factors including standards of living and recognizes that wages cannot increase to a level that substantially curtails employment
8957664 the minimum wage in america samoa unlike the marianas or guam is set by the department of labor and industry committee so that it is determined in a different way than the others including our states

8957685 cet dito refl te beaucoup de stupidit et de haine de soi la proposition est dabord particuli rement stupide en termes de sant publique lame est un outil indispensable et son acc s a d j t r duit ces deux derni res ann es elle sadresse aux personnes en situation irr guli re sur le territoire depuis au moins 3 mois et qui gagnent moins de 600 euros ces personnes nont pas acc s la pr vention et peuvent souffrir de pathologies assez lourdes la suppression de lame pourrait provoquer la r surgence de certaines maladies quon croyait radiqu es comme la tuberculose ensuite le chiffre cit pour le co t de lame 800 millions deuros est faux ce qui est assez tonnant de la part dun journaliste de ce niveau les rapports de linspection g n rale des finances et de linspection g n rale des affaires sociales de 2007 le prouvent enfin cest une r gression totale sur le plan moral devant laquelle on ne peut tre queffar l dito exprime une position qui est traditionnellement celle de lextr me droite le pr sident de la r publique a fait un coup gauche en annon ant un financement du rsa par une taxe sur le capital les propagandistes du fn r agissent je ne pensais pas en trouver au figaro qui plus est lier la suppression de lame celle du financement de laudiovisuel ext rieur comme le fait yves de kerdrel cest dire clairement replions nous sur nous m mes il y a bien dautres moyens de financer en partie le rsa pourquoi ne pas cr er une taxe sur les jeux de hasard
8957686 quun journaliste du figaro dise que pour venir en aide aux d munis il faut sattaquer aux plus d munis cela m tonne moyennement cependant je ne pense pas que les fran ais acceptent ce sch ma de pens e quand yves de kerdrel parle de coup port une fois de plus ceux qui cr ent des richesses il faut souligner que les sans papiers qui travaillent eux aussi cr ent des richesses je vois a plut t comme une bavure quautre chose en effet nicolas sarkozy vient de faire quelque chose de fort pour une fois il prend largent l o il faut pour le donner aux d munis la droite nappr cie pas yves de kerdrel attaque les pr caires l o ils sont les plus pr caires cest aberrant
8957687 manifestement yves de kerdrel est mal inform lame co te 500 et non 800 millions selon le rapport de linspection g n rale des affaires sociales igas de 2007 sa suppression serait totalement irresponsable en termes de sant publique dabord on augmenterait la d pense en emp chant lacc s aux soins surtout supprimer la couverture maladie des plus pauvres parmi les plus pauvres cest retirer un m canisme de protection sociale de lordre de la survie il est tout aussi irresponsable de dire que les travailleurs en situation irr guli re ne cr ent pas de richesses cest le contraire ils cotisent et ne peuvent tre assur s depuis 2002 cest tous les ans quil y a des tentatives pour supprimer lame notamment au parlement lors du vote des lois de finance ce nest quune attaque de plus mais celle ci est frontale

8957697 how else could he mccain propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million americans how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college or a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement plus lobbyists always an easy target
8957698 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it

8957842 i have had a few women tell me that they might have mixed feelings about palin because it wouldnt be fair that
8957843 im still not clear where she stands on the issue of womens reproductive freedom
8957844 lady penelope you dont know completely what youre talking about so id suggest talking about it less
8957845 and should they make the mistake of going after her that way you can be damned sure her party will take it to the streets unlike the assholes in ours who just stood there with their thumbs up their butts
8957846 a lot of the experience talk is overblown when it comes to foreign affairs john osullivan is the expert on this but i dont think lady thatcher had much foreign affairs experience to speak of when she became pm in contrast sen biden has a ton of foreign policy experience enough to have been wrong on just about every major issue over the last 30 years seems to me the people with loads of foreign policy experience are drenched in the kennedy school wilson school internationalist view of the world as between that and someone whos smart has sensible instincts and has a healthy washingtonian suspicion of international entanglements ill take the latter thank you
8957847 alaska gov sarah palin has exactly the high energy political toughness and conservative reform message that would boost sen john mccains presidential run if big mac were to put her on the ticket in an interview last evening on cnbc palin was very clear on her drill drill drill message for alaska and the rest of the u s along with her strong supply side tax cutting and free market economic views
8957848 i dont know if its going to pull hillary clintons voters in but i think its just good to have the diversity on the ticket

8957862 noi lucram cu probe iar p na acum in urma instrumentarii lor nu putem spune cu siguranta ca el a tras in momentul incidentului erau patru cinci persoane nu este exclus sa fi tras el sau altcineva cert este ca in scurt timp vom avea autorul

8957878 its all part of this wussification syndrome that were seeing in contemporary australia where schools have been forced to bow to the great god of occupational health and safety
8957879 we have schools in victoria which have banned birthday cakes with candles on them because the children might burst into flames and where soccer has been banned during recess because the kids might be hit in the face by the ball
8957880 children are not accessories to dress up and keep behind glass if we continue to cloak them in cotton wool and outsource their development to lawyers we will have a bunch of kids who are almost frightened of the world this is very serious
8957881 when you do something thats a little bit on the edge the lessons are learnt before you get to an age when the toys youre playing with can potentially kill
8957882 if they havent learnt appropriate risk taking before theyre in charge of a motor vehicle the consequences are often fatal
8957883 hovering over their children keeping the germs away and making sure that theyre safe
8957884 if you extend this ludicrousness to its logical end no child will ever learn to ride a bicycle because they might fall off
8957885 whats next are we going to ban the pencil because of the risk of rsi
8957886 an essential part of growing up is exposure to the fact that life isnt always fair
8957887 when things do go wrong children can pick themselves up start again and learn from the negative experience
8957888 because were sheltering them from that im seeing 12 and 13 year old kids who are just normally sad because their dogs died or their parents have divorced and theyre running off to gps looking for anti depressants because they think theyre depressed
8957889 but schools have increasingly sanitised the playing environment for kids taking out a lot of the monkey bars in order to protect from litigation
8957890 as a result if kids do any physical activity its usually not involving their upper body most kids today couldnt hang and support their weight
8957891 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
8957892 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
8957893 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
8957894 we got to shift this dynamic we got to change this paradigm its a big challenge and one which we better bite into
8957895 o saunders had information from rockland that this was stolen in the town of whitman
8957896 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
8957897 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
8957898 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
8957899 i feel a lot better now though because at least i know i will have a home to come back to
8957900 its like youve been slapped so hard in the past that you can almost still feel it i just know how much work it was rebuilding everything
8957901 were not done seeing headcount reductions on wall street in this cycle
8957902 for the franchise and shares to turn the corner we think management needs to announce a significant bulk asset sale or framework for investors to evaluate the structure pricing of likely asset disposals and incremental capital should it be needed
8957903 whether we win or lose were going to be in the same position on the ladder so its more about us getting our processes right and certainly the style but more importantly we thought we turned the corner a little last week as far as form for some individuals and as a team wed like to keep that going
8957904 weve got a lot of respect for the adelaide football club they really are a good honest side who just work hard for each other and even if they werent playing for a home final you know youre going to get a great contest from them
8957905 there was a bit of anxiety amongst the group going in to round one but having a victory early i think was a catalyst for us to get a good roll on to the next seven or eight weeks
8957906 espera se que o stf n o rasgue nossa constitui o
8957907 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8957908 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8957909 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8957910 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8957911 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8957912 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8957913 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8957914 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8957915 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8957916 but lets hope that americans are going to address the problems that are bedeviling the country
8957917 this is the hardest job ive ever had my emotions flit from elation to despair in the same period and i drag myself home every day teaching is a herculean task

8957919 we havent slammed the gavel on that the saskatchewan roughriders head coach said when asked if michael bishop will start
8957920 i have to keep in mind the overall team and what the expectations are miller said
8957921 we are a performance and production based team and we have to get into a winning situation here
8957922 he has even brought a couple of suggestions about things he wanted us to tweak for him miller said
8957923 he has put in extra hours beyond what we ask all of our quarterbacks to do
8957924 i just have to keep getting my reps and hope that i get the opportunity bishop said
8957925 he produced really well last year but this year he hasnt performed at the same level miller said
8957926 we have the possibility of bringing in more receivers and we have already brought in gerran walker miller said
8957927 ill take a photo of the two of you guys
8957928 so you walk down here it will get you back to a main road
8957929 yeah but you dont want to be here after dark
8957930 oh it gets crazy here after dark there are rats and wild animals with rabies you dont want to be in here after dark the rats are two feet long
8957931 oh theres people here too but theyre not even human
8957932 oh they got worse than rabies you dont want to be out here after dark it aint safe most people dont know when it gets dark in here its pitch black there are no lights you cant even see the path in front of you
8957933 i dont mean to scare you or nothing but were about due for a killing in here statistically speaking i mean statistically we are overdue for a killing a body dumping a shooting or something
8957934 ingrijorarea fata de schimbarile facute in osetia de sud si abhazia
8957935 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8957936 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8957937 i think teams who have deficits should be kicked out of europe
8957938 the only way to go is that there is a control over all of europe and i think it will go that way whether you like it or not
8957939 uefa will bring in a control of the management of every individual club and every individual club will be controlled
8957940 it is very important for the fans of the competition first and it is very important that every club lives with the resources they have available clubs should not speculate and then after one year they cannot pay the salaries for the next seasons
8957941 every transfer nowadays in europe is paid over two or three years and it is compulsory that uefa controls that the commitment of the club is right because if that does not happen it can all collapse very quickly
8957942 i buy the players i feel strengthen the squad after that i consider the price
8957943 i do the job i think it has to be done considering the resources of the club and considering our ambition and the players we have
8957944 i know the media and supporters sometimes too are happy with big numbers but for me what is most important is big quality sometimes both are linked but not always
8957945 last year it was at midnight and we are ready to stay up all night this time if it is needed
8957946 for a while they all talk the talk and nothing happens then in the last four or five days every half an hour there is a headline saying someone has signed somewhere
8957947 when you have experience of transfer dealings you know that as long as something is not signed you know it can change very quickly so you can look very silly so you dont want to come out and announce it
8957948 we are out to look if we find the right players we will do it one or two

8957955 its important for this club to be back in the uefa cup its nice for the fans to experience european football again
8957956 this is a big tie for us because we are aiming to get into the group stages
8957957 it is not an easy draw they are a good side the portuguese league is a tough one with teams like fc porto sporting lisbon and benfica but vitoria finished third last season so they cant be bad
8957958 it is a big thing for this club to be in europe and we are looking forward to it but weve got several important premier league games before that and well focus on those first

8957984 mccain will be the oldest first term president in history with a history of health concerns
8957985 its only recently that people have begun to see the link between physical activity and mental health
8957986 its important for increasing peoples self esteem general mood coping with stress and even sleeping better
8957987 and we now have very strong evidence that physical activity can prevent depression
8957988 it could be a simple case of use it or lose it
8957989 it is estimated that over 700 000 people in the uk currently suffer from dementia and more research is needed to determine how this condition can be prevented
8957990 there has already justifiably been a lot of emphasis on good nutrition but we must also find ways of helping people to be more physically active to ensure that they maintain health and quality of life in later years
8957991 we have half a century of evidence showing active people have lower levels of disease
8957992 we also have a very good handle on how much exercise people should take
8957993 many studies suggest benefits for mental health from exercise and for the first time we have been able to quantify the amount of activity which seems to make a difference
8957994 but it is a chicken and egg issue as those who suffer from stress or anxiety may be less likely to take part in physical activity in the first place
8957995 this study may offer hope to those suffering mental pain that small manageable lifestyle changes can improve mental wellbeing
8957996 the brain is as much a physical organ as the heart or lungs so perhaps it should not come as a surprise that even little amounts of regular exercise can begin to reduce psychological distress
8957997 when people hear the word aerobic they tend to think of lycra and tracksuits but there are all sorts of activities from dancing to swimming that can make a huge difference
8957998 there has long been the assumption that retirement is about putting your feet up but gradually were getting the message across that keeping active is good for you in so many ways

8958018 our fiscal 2008 financial goals were to generate double digit bookings growth stabilize revenue and manage cash and expenses we largely achieved these goals particularly through the growth in our core products bookings although the timing of customer acceptances did impact revenue for the year
8958019 these new products have allowed us to capture some of the worlds most coveted

8958025 it certainly improved the ability of human beings to create and adapt to function in and with groups communities and cultures and to respond to pain associated with social interactions
8958026 however the cerebral cortex may also have had an unintended effect of allowing humans to relive re experience and suffer from social pain
8958027 there is something very intangible about emotional damage with physical pain you can see the bruise but in emotional abuse there is often fear and anxiety which remains
8958028 if someone tells you in the playground that they are going to get you after school then you tend to be anxious and afraid about it far more than if someone just punches you there and then
8958029 only goes to show that the military is so weak under the leadership of the commander in chief now
8958030 you cannot blame these people who arm themselves because they are afraid they cannot be protected by the military now if they cannot be protected by the armed forces we cannot blame them
8958031 a blessing im happy with whatever help for my children

8958035 once the nurses graduate they will no longer live here what are we doing how does this translate to making our city better
8958036 promoting the victory garden revival and other simple earth friendly endeavors as bipartisan patriotic acts in an age of uncertainty
8958037 when people talk about a broken heart that for me was where it was seated just below your sternum
8958038 it feels like your heart is leaking and you cant run away from it because you are the source of that pain
8958039 if you listen to people who are damaged emotionally they will often translate their pain into physical similes my head is bursting my guts are aching and so on the parallel is very strong
8958040 were at a very new time when we can use technologies to look at the brain and the heart
8958041 the social attachment system is piggy backed onto the physical pain system to make sure we stay connected to close others
8958042 being wrenched from another or rejected by a group is painful so we avoid it
8958043 they experience a lot of bitterness and anger that their future is senseless they dont adapt with time as others do
8958044 there is an increased risk of dying in the six months after bereavement and its particularly marked amongst men
8958045 barack obama is an immensely talented man whose talents have been largely devoted to crafting and chronicling his own life not things not ideas not institutions but himself nothing wrong or even terribly odd about that except that he is laying claim to the job of crafting the coming history of the united states a leap of such audacity is odd

8958054 this isnt just about cutting down on the number of squirrels killed on the roads we also know that when a natural habitat becomes fragmented such as by the introduction of unnatural barriers like roads there is a lesser chance of the species surviving in the long term because the opportunities for breeding are fewer the bridges hopefully encourage the squirrels to explore a wider area and therefore lessen the chance of inbreeding by finding out whether they actually use these bridges we can assess how useful it is to install them
8958055 an snh grant for rope bridges was successfully applied for by the local community of strachur and two have been erected across the main road there but we needed to find out how cost effective they were before spending any more money putting them up at other sites when we looked into it we were surprised to discover that no one has ever really tested the efficiency of these bridges the research that stephen from the university of leeds has now carried out should help us make our case when we apply for funding for future projects
8958056 in areas where there is a high population of squirrels then the new bridges we put up were being used within a couple of days not surprisingly we also found that baiting the bridges with food also encouraged the squirrels to use them this kind of information has never been collected before and it could now be used by other wildlife conservation groups or even by developers when considering plans for new road building projects that cut through squirrel habitat
8958057 our masters programme in biodiversity and conservation provides us with an opportunity to conduct the kind of research that could have a real impact on british wildlife this project is just one example
8958058 the desert nesting bald eagle population is highly threatened and entirely distinct from other bald eagle populations no recognized bald eagle expert disagrees

8958061 yellowstone is located atop of one of the few large volcanic hotspots on earth
8958062 but though the hot material is a volcanic plume its cooler than others of its kind such as one in hawaii
8958063 although yellowstone sits above a plume of hot material coming up from deep with the earth its a remarkably lukewarm plume
8958064 it would be a mistake to write off yellowstone as a dead volcano a hot plume even a slightly cooler one is still hot
8958065 we believe this is due not only to safety improvements in the vehicles but also the added public awareness combined with increased enforcement as a result thousands of lives have been saved over the past 60 years
8958066 my grandfather would be proud to know that a program created under his watch so many years ago is still going strong and preventing tragedy today
8958067 its clear there would be more traffic fatalities today without the added enforcement by not only the chp but all law enforcement in california we also want to give special thanks to the media for helping us save lives by getting the word out during these periods
8958068 our hope is that this research will improve the screening process for migraine in soldiers and increase education about migraine for soldiers and their health care providers u s military personnel should receive the best health care available and improving the diagnosis and treatment of migraine will likely improve soldiers personal and professional functioning
8958069 because seat belts can reduce the risk of injury and death in crashes by more than 50 there is a critical need for interventions to increase seat belt use by teens as both drivers and passengers
8958070 this research reinforces why state farm is actively involved in advocating for laws that help prevent injuries and deaths resulting from motor vehicle crashes its clear from these findings that primary seat belt laws for all occupants would help us accomplish that goal

8958072 we felt it was important to honor all the pets that suffered as well as all the volunteers who came and went without any recognition

8958074 this memorial recognizes this evolution and that we need to always include pets in the disaster planning process

8958076 once the evacuation of the shelter goes into effect the shelter will not reverse its evacuation process
8958077 this is not what dogs were put on this planet for
8958078 i dont think there is anything to be concerned about because if elected president i have no intention to actually accept the presidency
8958079 it comes as no surprise to us that such an inexperienced politician would inexperiencedly change his inexperienced mind on this inexperiencable nomination while we understand that he has an inexperienced right to accept the inexperienced nomination we have to wonder if the real american patriots the ones who dont cut and run and cry and whine would rather have an inexperienced flip flopper like obama or an experienced one like president mccain its no wonder that such an inexperienced politician has the support of castro bin laden admhaa what ever his name is in iran and satan himself
8958080 in the process of economic globalization muslims are not separatists
8958081 senator john mccain today announced that he has selected alaska governor sarah palin to be his running mate and to serve as his vice president
8958082 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president

8958084 the evolution of the cerebral cortex certainly improved the ability of human beings to create and adapt to function in and with groups communities and culture and to respond to pain associated with social interactions
8958085 however the cerebral cortex may also have had an unintended effect of allowing humans to relive re experience and suffer from social pain
8958086 despite californias mandate to aggressively reduce greenhouse gases the california energy commission is allowing new power plants to be built without evaluating their impacts on climate change
8958087 the energy commission needs to champion clean energy by making sure new energy sources reduce harm to the climate
8958088 business as usual is devastating to our climate and local environment
8958089 global warming is already harming sierra species like the pika and is projected to have a significant effect on the states snowpack and water supplies in the near future

8958093 recent estimates indicate that if trends continue the way they are developing countries will face a 75 increase in the number of cervical cancer cases because of growth and aging of the population in the next two decades but it doesnt have to turn out that way
8958094 the discovery of hpv as the cause of cervical cancer has shaken a field that was stagnating and we are now in a new era where developing countries no longer have to be left behind
8958095 efforts are needed now to adapt the current price of the vaccines so they meet what individual countries can afford the solution may be tiered pricing according to gross national income per capita and according to the scale of country efforts
8958096 the models provide a useful roadmap for testing promising strategies in the field more research is needed to determine an efficient combination of these new approaches and each country will have to decide which is best for them but we are confident we have provided a valuable starting point for going forward

8958102 there are some areas which are still completely cut off where the water is between 10 15 feet
8958103 the need is definitely more than what the government and a few aid agencies are able to provide
8958104 people on the ground say it is definitely higher than the estimates
8958105 eye witnesses say there are so many people who are missing people are just drowning in the water
8958106 they need shelter and food and right now they the government are not ready for this number of people
8958107 the reach has been widening and more areas are coming under water we are racing against time
8958108 in 15 20 days there will be seven districts that will be affected

8958110 look here vitali is only six weeks to go and he hasnt pulled out yet
8958111 he knows whats on the line even if he got slightly injured in training i think he would still fight unless he literally cant make it up the stairs that is
8958112 i gave away my title freely because of my knee injury
8958113 i am the true heavyweight champion vitali you never beat a champion you say you are the champion but you are not a champion you cant be the champion until you beat me and you cant beat peter

8958115 but ill tell you what if he fights he wins
8958116 i look at this as the most difficult fight of samuel peters career
8958117 vitali hits harder than his brother and i think in his prime say five years ago he was a better fighter than wladimir ever was
8958118 and the inactivity you could look at in a couple of ways
8958119 one is that he might be a bit rusty but the other is that vitali klitschko might just be fresh as a daisy and just because the u s boxing team came home empty handed doesnt mean its members are destined for failure as pros
8958120 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community where it is in fact a court of nato

8958142 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8958143 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8958144 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8958145 for the russians to say they are not responsible for what happened in georgia is ludicrous russia is to blame for this crisis and the world is responding to what russia has done
8958146 the simultaneous launch of five satellites is not without its challenges commissioning will be performed from both the rapideye ground station in brandenburg and the sstl mission control centre in guildford the five satellites will gradually disperse from each other following separation from the launch vehicle allowing three satellites to be tracked and operated from brandenburg with the remainder under the control of the guildford operators this method of operation offers the most efficient route to achieving the maximum amount of contact time per satellite during the early days of commissioning following launch as the satellites are gradually manoeuvred into position around the orbit during the commissioning phase the brandenburg ground station will assume full control over the constellation
8958147 sstl long ago established the benefits of small satellite constellations and launched the disaster monitoring constellation in 2002 paving the way for a new paradigm in remote sensing the launch of rapideye will fully realise the business potential of constellations the simultaneous build of five satellites is the largest mission so far in terms of maximising and managing production at sstls guildford facilities expert in house engineering and project management teams worked closely with mda streamlining the design build and test of all five satellite platforms

8958153 expanding the group would realize russias goal of turning the sco into an anti american anti nato counterweight
8958154 it comes as a result of western criticism of russia for its military action in georgia and for recognizing
8958155 i would just say that it wasnt what i would call an endorsement of russias recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia

8958216 palin is becoming a star in the conservative movement a fiscal conservative in a state that is looking like a boondoggle for pork barrel spending
8958217 shes young vibrant fresh and now and a new mother of five she should be in the top tier if the republican party wants to wrestle itself free from the perception that it is royalist and not open to putting new talent on the bench this would be the real opportunity

8958220 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one

8958228 great news for conservatives for the party and for the country
8958229 her dedication to principle her courage both before and after her election as governor of alaska and her personal qualities make her a perfect choice for vice president i predict any conservatives who have been lukewarm thus far in their support of the mccain candidacy will work their hearts out between now and november for the mccain palin ticket
8958230 she completes a strong ticket that will bring a real record of change and reform to washington
8958231 governor palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party she is a strong defender of traditional family values with an unquestioned commitment to protect life governor palin knows we must aggressively pursue american energy sources like offshore drilling to reduce our dependence on foreign oil

8958242 data from european demographers and statistical bureaus show that a majority of children in sweden and norway are now born out of wedlock as are 60 percent of first born children in denmark
8958243 kurtzs argument which oreilly embraces is that when legal rights are accorded to gays through some unspecified process heterosexual couples begin bearing children out of wedlock and refuse to marry when they otherwise would there are many government policies that alter the incentives to get and stay married and thus have direct and unsurprising effects on marriage for instance the availability of no fault divorce leads to more divorces and laws providing the same rights for cohabitating heterosexual couples as married couples lead to fewer marriages as couples make private commitments to each other without seeking the imprimatur of the state but neither kurtz nor oreilly has provided a plausible justification for their belief that extending rights to gay couples harms heterosexual marriage
8958244 back at national review online contributing editor stanley kurtz makes the same point
8958245 the replacement of a traditional ethic of sacrifice by a post 60s ethos of self fulfillment
8958246 nursing was once built around a spirit of feminine compassion and sacrifice in the new feminist world that is unacceptable
8958247 i think the vote of no confidence in lawrence summers is a wonderful thing harvard continues to discredit itself with the american public the faculty is trapped if summers resigns this extraordinary example of political correctness will come back to haunt harvard and the entire academy for years but if summers hangs on the faculty itself will have been humiliated checked by the very fact of public scrutiny either way harvard is tearing itself apart so long as the public simply writes of the academy the mice can play but the intense public scrutiny in this case puts the captains of political correctness into a no win situation like the closely watched susan estrich fiasco this battle is doing lasting damage to the cultural left as they say sunlight is the best disinfectant

8958276 we remind the commission that under the rules of democracy only a court should be able to censor a website this order which was not the result of any complaint brought before the courts is not only questionable but also disproportionate as it was issued because of comments posted on the site about the articles we call for malaysia today to be unblocked at once

8958285 someone get the oil can because my bitter tears keep hardening me
8958286 i am the king of the forest hear me roar but let me run away and follow everyone else first
8958287 why i am the malstrom leprechaun i will show you the path of the rainbow that leads to the pot of gold at the other end
8958288 attacking gamers who dont share the same taste as i is the path to the gold
8958289 quoting these three gentlemen all the time is the path to the gold
8958290 there are only two possible futures the first was next gen the second was new gen based on what has happened which is the correct one
8958291 they both are next gen is showing their consoles are selling and new gen shows nintendo has tapped into a new market
8958292 how can two opposing premises and strategies both be right how can that even be possible
8958293 it is because we have discovered a magical market called casual gamers customers are annoying things they are cantankerous and dont move always toward the future we want this magical market that we call casuals is like the puzzle piece with metamorphic properties that bends and shapes itself to make everything we say true
8958294 you want next gen to occur yet you must explain nintendos success
8958295 by applying the magical market we can ignore nintendo by saying their success comes only from these magical casual gamers while we study and analyze what we want next generation
8958296 allows me to support the wii by putting out very cheap titles that mimic everyone else in cowardly herd like thinking like cattle we move as one this magical market allows me to make the next gen games that i would rather do because it is easier to make incremental improvements via technology than to reconsider what customers want
8958297 tricks are kids the magical market has allowed me to dismiss the wii entirely since we know the magical market is not real therefore the wii cannot be real the magical market is what is saving next generation in mind share
8958298 the magical market is what is saving next generation in mind share
8958299 do you not see what is going on here instead of facing reality instead of truly seeing that one path was right and the other path was wrong you have invented a magical market that explains the wiis magical sales this allows you to omit the wii entirely from console analysis now that the wii no longer exists you get to compare next gen to itself thus you can say next gen is successful because you have placed the wii into a void
8958300 you must come to grips that there is no magical market there are no casual gamers as they never studied how to fly when one of you try to seriously study the magical market you always end up seeing what you want to see
8958301 i see senior citizens in retirement homes this is so i can better dismiss the wii for serious gaming
8958302 i see young girls this is so i can prove to investors that my company is able to tap into the new market
8958303 i see older women this is so i can safely say the wiis success cannot impact the next gen consoles
8958304 i see idiots who fall prey to marketing schemes this is so i can safely ignore the wii by considering it a great market success and not a great gaming success
8958305 each of you four have wanted the industry to grow up
8958306 what reason could i have for not desiring to see such a discovery of a magical market made
8958307 i will venture to say that this industry in this respect the dupes of one of the strangest illusions that have ever taken possession of our fear of an industry being re formatted into creating video games that are not video games growing up is scary video game industry will become grown up when it stops seeing itself in the video game business and more in the interactive entertainment business
8958308 i want you to think of things without the aid of a magical market
8958309 but i would have to re examine my definition of quality
8958310 if your dear heart is wounded my wild heart bleeds with yours in the rapture of my enormous humiliation i live in your warm life and you shall die die sweetly die into mine listen de world
8958311 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8958312 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8958313 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8958314 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8958315 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship
8958316 i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes

8958328 i am honored to be joining the areaa on its board of directors to help lead and grow the greater atlanta chapter which was recently founded as a new chapter in may of 2008
8958329 i serve many clients in the greater atlanta region and as an asian american i am extremely proud to serve my community here
8958330 many asian americans and other minorities have relocated to the atlanta area over the last five to ten years and they are being disproportionately impacted by the recent real estate slow down
8958331 i feel a responsibility to represent the interests of those who are the most challenged at this time to ensure homeownership for everyone
8958332 the areaa is dedicated to promoting homeownership opportunities in asian american communities
8958333 by supporting this association i join with my colleagues to help create a voice both locally and nationally for real estate professionals who serve this dynamic market

8958336 i applaud your vision of placing wind turbines atop buildings in new york city the technology for such a vision exists today and can be implemented relatively easily with the support of government and civic leaders such as you
8958337 unfortunately many people think of small wind turbines as not cost effective
8958338 in fact the technology exists today to tap into wind power on top of roof tops with compact efficient and affordable wind turbines these can work anywhere from high rises to shopping centers
8958339 the elections of the provinces councils will be done this year

8958341 manny pacquiao is considered the best fighter in boxing today and i always want to fight the best
8958342 i am glad we were able to make this fight happen because while pacquiao is at the pinnacle of his success and has defeated all of the top fighters he has faced i am going to show the world that it stops with me december 6 cant get here soon enough
8958343 when i take that walk to the ring to fight oscar i will carry all the people of the philippines the entire country on my shoulders i promise i will fight with all of my heart and that i will give everything i have like my trainer freddie roach says i have what it takes to win the biggest fight of my life
8958344 this fight will have the whole world talking and will be a fantastic night for boxing oscars career has always been defined by taking on the biggest challenges and fighting best names in boxing this fight against a great champion like manny pacquiao is just another testament to his readiness to face the strongest competition and continue his legacy as one of the greatest fighters boxing has ever seen
8958345 this fight is what all sports fans are looking forward to a contest between two champions who come to fight and who are the most popular names in boxing today manny pacquiao is taking on a major task in facing the legendary oscar de la hoya but we at top rank are very confident manny will handle himself extremely well
8958346 mgm mirage has hosted the greatest names in sports and entertainment and this event will certainly continue that tradition we look forward to presenting one of the most exciting promotions in the history of boxing and there is no question this fight will have a major impact on fans worldwide
8958347 de la hoya pacquiao is a dream match up which will capture the imagination of sports fans everywhere its the pay per view king vs the pound for pound king and an event in which both fighters popularity clearly transcends the sport
8958348 we believe the province could turn over to iraqi control in just a few days
8958349 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
8958350 anbar remains a dangerous place but the ever growing ability of the iraqi security forces continues to move us closer to seeing iraqi control of the province
8958351 however in order to do more in afghanistan our marines have got to see relief elsewhere
8958352 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business
8958353 25 000 marines in the province are probably being in excess of the need especially after iraqi provincial control assumes responsibilities for security
8958354 its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be
8958355 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalised an agreement
8958356 differences revolve around a schedule of the withdrawal of u s forces from iraq as well as their powers and the description of these troops
8958357 although the iraqi delegation has insisted on that date the americans have some reservations over it
8958358 the cooperation between the relevant oil companies from china and iraq is mutually beneficial
8958359 it will be conducive to the economic development of iraq and will meet chinas demands in the oil field as well and is also conducted according to market rules and will not harm any interests of any third parties
8958360 with oil prices surging the global contest for oil resources is becoming ever fiercer many governments have realised this and have become unwilling to sell their oil resources cheaply to the multinationals
8958361 since it has become more and more difficult to obtain equity and exploit rights in oil fields its good for china to participate in the development through a service contract it diversifies our oil sources and helps guarantee chinas oil supplies
8958362 since people are not selling their homes theyre fixing things up
8958363 they are putting in new doors drywall repairs shelving bathroom remodeling shower tiling painting etc
8958364 the best thing you can do painting is usually the best return on your investment new fixtures ceiling fans updated lighting and even ensuring that every door opens and closes can be very important too

8958366 negli ultimi tempi si sono moltiplicati i malfunzionamenti di mezzi appartenenti alla compagnia aerea ryanair che hanno costretto gli equipaggi ad atterraggi di emergenza la ristretta vicinanza dei tempi in cui questi incidenti si sono ripetuti prosegue il sottosegretario desta evidentemente il legittimo dubbio che essi non siano da addebitarsi alla sola casualit statistica presente in ogni attivit umana ma a qualche defaillance nella catena di controlli e manutenzione della compagnia in oggetto

8958376 noi speriamo che la ragione prevalga sulle emozioni che i leader dellue trovino il coraggio di trattenersi da una valutazione unilaterale del conflitto
8958377 stanno dicendo chiaro e tondo che pensano di poter fare ci che vogliono impunemente
8958378 ma credo che qualunque tipo di reazione nei confronti dellue sarebbe del genere restrizioni dei visti o congelamento dei rapporti commerciali non penso che la ritorsione comporterebbe cose come una stretta petrolifera

8958381 today awareness of beauty products treatments and grooming is at an all time high thats why w e introduced our new brand womsee a range of natural colour cosmetics to the consumers cosmetic industry in india is booming and considering the fact our products are mainly targeted to the premium segment of the stratum
8958382 we were looking for a pr agency which is most suitable for us in terms of generating awareness for our regular exhibitions as well as image building of the organization the presentation made by approach communications was in line with our communication approach so we decided to go with approach communications
8958383 as we have already worked on few life style related account working for an art gallery will be very exciting for us
8958384 considering that india alone has 60 million disabled people it is imperative that accessible technologies are made available to people with disabilities and it is the endeavor of techshare to create an environment and ecosystem that supports this need
8958385 techshare 2008 intends to draw upon the wisdom of people who have tremendous experience in the field and share it with people who face challenges every day
8958386 successive governments have neglected early child and primary education because of which there is lack of human resources which in turn is affecting the indian economy
8958387 the world our kids are going to live in is changing four times faster than our schools
8958388 the opposite is the truth human babies love to learn and are born to explore have fun and build their skill levels knowledge and skill level leads only to good
8958389 parents who truly love and respect their children and give them the gift of knowledge skill and ability they are happier kinder and more caring than those children who have not been given these opportunities
8958390 till 15 years ago parents and neuro scientist believed that at the moment the child is born his neuro circuitry or in simpler word brain performance is already genetically wired 10 years ago 1997 the neuro scientist discovered that to be wrong they found out and informed the world that it is the early experiences and activities which shapes the brain

8958399 this is senator mccains decision and his announcement and we all want to be respectful of his desire to have the chance to announce it himself
8958400 last year we signed a player at midnight on the 31st and we will be up and ready as late as we have to on the 1st so you never know
8958401 there is a long time to go already there has been an acceleration every half an hour there is a headline that someone has signed somebody
8958402 will we sign someone maybe or maybe not its as simple as that we are out to look if we find the right players maybe one we will but i think we should focus on our qualities
8958403 it looks like we are one in the toughest groups because we face teams who are used to playing in europe there are long trips involved but we have the squad to cope with every problem we face in the season
8958404 porto has maybe more experience than any other team because theyve already won it and been there a few times in the final stages and they always make it difficult for anyone in england but fenerbahce are an up and coming team and made it to the quarter finals for the first time last year
8958405 kiev have always the best players in their country but they can be a very dangerous side we played against them with shevchenko and luzhny
8958406 it gives you an edge in the premier league if you qualify early and you are not under stress in games four five or six but its difficult to predict you will qualify early united have villarreal and that isnt easy neither is celtic for anybody in the premier league
8958407 owen is an intelligent player when i arrived in england he was young but looked fantastic sharp and intelligent in front of goal his career was disturbed a lot by injuries thats the luck you get when you are a great footballer
8958408 he is not just a goalscorer he can make assists and runs but his main focus is to score goals he is an intelligent runner and recently he scored headers after coming on
8958409 it is very welcome i think teams who have a deficit should be kicked out of europe
8958410 the only way to go is that there is a control over all of europe and i think it will go that way whether you like it or not
8958411 it is very important for the fans of the competition first and it is very important that every club lives with the resources they have available clubs should not speculate and then after one year they cannot pay the salaries for the next seasons
8958412 every transfer nowadays in europe is paid over two or three years and it is compulsory that uufa controls that the commitment of the club is right because if that does not happen it can all collapse very quickly
8958413 but when you look at the numbers involved right now nobody can do that anymore

8958420 its taken some time to finalize the details but now that the numbers are tallied we are more than pleased with the initial success royal palms has experienced
8958421 royal palms senior apartments are very nicely appointed with all the unit amenities one would expect from a luxury apartment
8958422 the royal palms common areas are spacious and luxuriously appointed and the amenities are many
8958423 this was meticulously planned to encourage the active lifestyle todays seniors want
8958424 no other community in the area offers anything close to royal palms
8958425 the difference is evident in the number of seniors who have already made it their home
8958426 many may not believe theyre quite ready but between selling the house filing papers and making all the other necessary arrangements it actually takes a surprisingly long time
8958427 we are closer to world war iii than to november elections
8958428 a measure that would decriminalize minor marijuana possession cases is on the ballot in massachusetts largely because of one man billionaire financier and liberal activist george soros of the 429 000 collected last year by the group advancing the measure 400 000 came from soros who has championed similar efforts in several states and spent 24 million to fight president bushs 2004 re election bid the committee for sensible marijuana policy needed about 315 000 of that just to collect the more than 100 000 signatures that secured a spot on the ballot according to campaign finance reports reviewed by the associated press

8958436 the secretary of state for health alan johnson claims that fluoridation is giving poor kids rich kids teeth
8958437 in fact it does the opposite it actually condemns one in eight of the population to a lifetime of paying for completely avoidable cosmetic dentistry
8958438 it is possible that a very small proportion of children may experience mild fluorosis following the introduction of a fluoridation scheme
8958439 but this has to be set against their significantly lower risk of tooth decay and their lower risk of needing teeth filled or extracted under a general anaesthetic
8958440 usually the fluorosis appears as pearly white marks often making the affected part of the tooth seem whiter than the rest
8958441 severe mottling where the marks are brown rather than white is associated with very high natural fluoride levels in water in hot climates this would not apply to the proposed scheme for southampton and surrounding areas

8958450 ik realiseer het mezelf nog het allerminst dat ik ineens bijna zestien jaar radio 538 achter me laat iedereen die heeft opgelet de afgelopen tijd weet wel waarom dat is maar om het symbolisch te zeggen je hebt een elastiek daar kun je heel lang aan trekken maar op een gegeven moment is de rek eruit en nu ga ik ergens heen waar er nog wel rek in zit
8958451 ik mocht er van de leiding nog gewoon drie jaar aan vast knopen ik heb daar vier weken vakantie voor gehad om erover na te denken ik heb heel veel te danken aan radio 538 ik vind het kut om weg te gaan ik had geen andere keus voor mezelf ik wil nu gewoon verder bij radio veronica
8958452 ik hoop dat al mijn jonge collegas bij dit radiostation onder het juk van alles vandaan komen en gewoon eens een keer laten horen wie ze werkelijk zijn op de radio ik hoop ook dat radio 538 weer gewoon die glans krijgt zoals het vroeger ook was dat er ook jongens zijn die dingen doen die niet mogen radio is een uitdaging zeker als je bij een jonge zender zit het is geen f cking sky radio het is een radiostation waarbij je ballen moet tonen en je dingen moet doen om mensen te vermaken en dat is niet alleen maar de muziek dat is wel belangrijk maar laat zien wie je bent

8958455 said russian backed forces had almost completed the ethnic cleansing of georgians from the areas
8958456 we were strongly in favor of territorial stability and integrity of georgia but after the last act of aggression and act of genocide and ethnic cleansing the south ossetian and abkhazian sides came to the conclusion that they can no longer live together with georgia in one state the reality is such that sooner or later the international community will come to an understanding of the existence of these two independent states
8958457 said russian backed forces had almost finished driving out georgians from rebel regions as part of a bid to reassert supremacy over georgia a now independent state that was once ruled from moscow under the old soviet union
8958458 the russian strategy is to create buffer zones empty territories from which people have been expelled all houses destroyed and fields burned so that it will be very difficult for people to return home even if security arrangements were made for that
8958459 it has been impossible to verify the extent of alleged human rights abuses in the conflict areas since foreign monitors have yet to be allowed into buffer zones set up by russian forces
8958460 contrary to the principles of the independence sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia that are recognized by the charter of the united nations
8958461 the three baltic states estonia latvia and lithuania which were annexed to the former soviet union for half a century have strongly condemned the recognition by russia of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
8958462 on other european countries to radically rethink their whole approach to russia
8958463 from now on the post 1991 theory of a new world order after the collapse of the soviet union according to which russia would not invade other countries is obsolete the fundamental assumption of all of the framework of european security since 1991 has changed we must completely rethink the very idea of european security
8958464 following yesterdays denunciation of russian conduct by the g7 grouping of the big industrial democracies russias key allies resisted moscows pressure for support over its policy toward georgia
8958465 putin suggested the georgia war had been cooked up in washington to create a neo cold war climate that would strengthen pro bush republican candidate john mccains bid for the white house and wreck the prospects of democratic candidate barack obama
8958466 no western plot to encircle russia and said there was no question of launching an all out war
8958467 said russia needed to consider the isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust
8958468 w hats happened since the collapse of the soviet union is not a western plot its a series of decisions by independent sovereign democracies about the course that they want to take not a course of confrontation with russia but a course of engagement with the west which i think is wholly within their rights and is something weve been right to support
8958469 which putin set up seven years ago as a foil to western power china and four former soviet central asian states called for respect for the territorial integrity of states and criticized the use of force to redraw borders effectively delivering a rebuke of russian conduct
8958470 try to drum up support for russias position but the summit statement only served to highlight russias worsening isolation
8958471 russia does not feel isolated and is not afraid to be isolated
8958472 sign an agreement on friendship and cooperation that will stipulate the deployment of a russian military base in the newly recognized republic
8958473 georgia attacked south ossetia on august 8 in an attempt to regain control over the separatist republic which split from the georgian government based in tbilisi in the early 1990s most people living in south ossetia have russian citizenship and moscow subsequently launched an operation to force georgia to accept peace the operation was concluded on august 12 russias president signed decrees tuesday recognizing south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states and called on other countries to follow suit although so far none has
8958474 europe and russia are again on a collision course experts say moscows decision to recognize georgias rebel provinces was a watershed moment in relations with the west in the first 100 days of dmitry medvedevs presidency europe seized on his liberal rhetoric as the promise of burgeoning economic possibilities but the war between georgia and russia that erupted in the next 10 days sent shockwaves through europe
8958475 the image of medvedev as a liberal has been terminally devalued in the eyes of europe he has become a figure rousing provocation rather than sympathy

8958480 more important than the dnc or obamas speech though was the other event this week that i dont believe we discussed 4 0 baby were going to the superbowl 16 0 woooooo go lions ive been behind em all the way restore the roar i believe in now
8958481 it needs to be said every team that has ever gone undefeated in the preseason has made the playoffs in fact the lions have done it twice both times they went all the way to the nfl championship and they even won it once now i dont think they will get that far but i dont think winning the division and getting a home playoff game is out of the question
8958482 theyre winning the superbowl im telling you they will go 16 0 and they will win it all ive been behind them 100 the lions are my team always have been always will be i bleed honolulu blue and silver and occasionally black when they wear the fearsome black jerseys im tired of all the naysayers this is the year the captain will lead us to the promised land and well be holding a parade down woodward in february
8958483 why im just proclaiming my love for my detroit lions you know what a huge fan ive been for the last 9 years
8958484 i hate you and i will stab you in the eye with a chicken wing tomorrow night
8958485 why all the hate i guess you just dont love the lions the way i do marching down the field
8958486 you know what i find amusing when they go 4 0 in the preseason you cant point out fast enough how the games are meaningless and dont translate to the real season but when they go 0 4 you are right there to use that as evidence of how bad they suck
8958487 i dont know what youre talking about i have been a lions fan my entire life im sitting here telling you that they are going to the playoffs after an undefeated season to win it all dont you know the statistical evidence
8958488 no because there is no evidence of that at all all you are doing to trying to irritate me which you are and eventually i will break down and start making fun of you and your tiny penis and then you will get pissy and proclaim you are not talking to me for the rest of the day
8958489 there isnt any evidence of a team going undefeated and winning the superbowl but the lions will make history

8958496 there is a great deal of quick thinking that comes with this style a lot of read and react and discipline this is what dantoni has to see come training camp and in time hell have to make decisions on players not just based on talent but intelligence so you shouldnt focus so much on whether or not q can hit shots but whether duhon can find him in the corner at the right time on the drive and kick its not about eddy curry posting up but can eddy catch it in the post pivot and make that weakside pass to an open man can jamal crawford find catch and shoot rhythm coming off curls instead of needing the and 1 hitch to set up his pull up these guys all can chuck and duck no question but recall the olympics again whenever the u s got itself into trouble was when it pounded the ball on the floor instead of passing it the most important thing to keep in mind when you play in this system is movement catch it and do something now

8958503 the los angeles lakers are hoping to repeat their surprising run to the nba finals this season incredibly their fate lies not in the shooting hand of kobe bryant the legs of pau gasol or even the shoulder lamar odom instead the lakers destiny rests on the knee of andrew bynum last season bynum surprised many with how far his game had developed the young post player from plainsboro new jersey showed significant improvement in his offensive arsenal defensive timing and maturity from his scene stealing 28 point performance against the suns last christmas to his 17 rebound game against milwaukee a few weeks later bynum showed all the signs of a future star
8958504 redemption complete for the kobe haters as you found yourself cheering in that fourth quarter did you ask yourself why havent i been appreciating this that 6 minutes that you found yourself sitting on the edge of your seat hoping that 3 4 years of preparations were for nothing when you felt pressure so tight you felt you had to go to the washroom kobe stepped up and did what he has been doing for 12 years never on that stage mind you but in front of our eyes for the longest still the question will remain in my head how can the greatest player in todays game be more loved in china when he has given us so much more
8958505 here is how these projections were summarized last fall had each chicago player maintained what they did last year the bulls would be on pace to win 57 games
8958506 that means he can also brush off talk that he is only coaching to break lenny wilkens all time victories mark don is 52 short of wilkens mark right now if don had a decent team that got to 49 or so victories this year he could be accused of hanging on another year just to break wilkens if he gets 32 or so this year its just don molding a young team and if he happens to pass lenny well let it happen i think it was 50 50 or better than nelson would be this teams coach next season before the ellis injury now if his health stays good i think its a 75 shot that nelson is coaching next year
8958507 haddadi will become the first iranian to play in the nba after spending the 2007 08 season playing for saba battery in the iranian super league he was cleared to play for the nba after u s government officials granted the league an office of foreign assets control license to employ haddadi nba commissioner david stern invited the iranian national team to compete in the summer league at utah irans appearance allowed the team a pre olympics tune up haddadi was the only player to average a double double 16 6 points 11 2 rebounds 2 6 blocks in the beijing olympics he competed in five games for the iranian national team which did not advance to the medal round his best performance came aug 16 against bronze medal winner argentina when he had a team high 21 points and game high 16 rebounds
8958508 i had imaging studies done on my ankle and basically the studies indicate that the ligament is just as it was two months ago when i had the first resonance it is not worse thats important now the issue is that its not better either and it seems that the only way to recovery fully is to have surgery
8958509 i know im a better coach after going through this
8958510 the depth of talent in the us ensures a great team every year while other teams will come and go but there will always be one or two teams capable of pushing the team usa no matter how good they are its basketball there are only five guys on the floor and one player can have a massively disproportional impact as evidenced by germanys fourth place finish in 2006 its safe to say that those nowitzki type players are out there and will keep showing up in ever greater numbers and that some of them will have other talent around a superstar so its rarely if ever going to be easy

8958540 senator john mccain chose gov sarah palin of alaska as his running mate on friday shaking up the political world with a surprise pick at a time when his campaign has been trying to attract women especially disaffected supporters of senator hillary rodham clinton
8958541 the pick confirmed by republicans familiar with the decision amounted to a roll of the dice a gamble that an infusion of new leadership and the novelty of the republican partys first female candidate for vice president would more than compensate for the risk that ms palin could undercut one of the mccain campaigns central arguments their claim that mr obama is too inexperienced to be president

8958576 we have a clear process to inform customers as to what they are buying through media mall
8958577 we warn people about their phone bills if high usage apps are downloaded

8958602 we are really excited to finally see the mighty phace and misanthrop machine set free upon the world set free because neosignal means no more compromise nobody to answer to a product a brand which is theirs from start to finish autonomy time to push boundaries
8958603 funked out rolling badness from phace this track is gonna be in my box for a long while to come its the perfect combination of a deep nasty dancefloor killer timeless
8958604 in his debut release for neosignal phace delivers another top of the range 12
8958605 probably my favourite track by phace evar a very untypical phace track one might say cause its so riff driven and progresses in a more subtle and dosed way than most genre counterparts it does things ive never heard a phace tune do before and yet still its undeniably phace but the most important reason why its such a standout tune is because its got so much heart so much more than most current techy d amp b its like hearing music youve been wanting to hear for a long time leaving you wondering why arent there more tracks like this and the answer is simple because magic like this doesnt happen often
8958606 neosignals first release brings the long awaited cold champagne rollers dont come much slicker than this phace bring the phunk with style once again killer every time and sick to mix massive support from the lifted camp
8958607 cold champagne brings back the phace funk from yesteryears a resurrected cut from their earlier days gets a face lift and delivers a tight blend of old phace with the new deep driving and introspective a must for any djs box whos willing to dig deeper
8958608 this is phace doing what they do best stomping driving twisting turning appealing to that part of your brain that only phace seem to know how to get to serious for me the best part about this tune is the fantastic switch from the brilliantly unusual levitating pad solo into a relentless persuasive groove that manages to breathe as much as it kicks and so the bar is set higher once again
8958609 we are really excited to finally see the mighty phace and misanthrop machine set free upon the world

8958616 its in that future where many people think that machine intelligence will surpass human intelligence
8958617 the acceleration of technological progress has been the central feature of this century
8958618 we are on the edge of change comparable to the rise of human life on earth the precise cause of this change is the imminent creation by technology of entities with greater than human intelligence

8958621 battery cant be identified this system will be unable to charge the battery until this battery is removed
8958622 we strongly condemn whatever is happening in orissa and such incidents must be stopped immediately
8958623 we condemn the murder of catholic priest father p thomas the ap federation of churches has demanded a cbi probe into the incident we will take up the matter with the centre and also write to the state government
8958624 the state should ensure the security of life and property of everybody and must not allow the continuance of violent activities on any pretext there no body should be allowed to take law in his hands and the state government should take immediate and stringent action against the rioters
8958625 its a matter of concern that churches are being attacked yet the state government is just a mute spectator to all this
8958626 centre can play a role if required if they desire to facilitate any discussion on this it will keep the investment environment in the country and west bengal alright
8958627 there is no role for the central government it is for the state government to decide
8958628 we praise the pm for his quick response to bihars demands for financial assistance and foodgrain in view of the natural disaster the rs 1 000 crore financial package besides 1 25 lakh tonnes of foodgrain being immediately made available to the state government from the centre will come in handy
8958629 unfortunate and advised both opposition and ruling party leaders to refrain from
8958630 the orissa government has completely failed to take steps on a war footing to stop the violence and there is no justification for it to continue in power
8958631 the violence let loose on chistians and their organisations by the vhp seems to be well planned
8958632 we had to resort to load shedding for six times because of the shortfall
8958633 nanda cannot be prosecuted under section 304 when the lawmakers are undecided and seeking responses from the experts for doing away with the milder penal section 304a
8958634 the commission has sought responses from experts as to whether persons accused of drunken driving which results into death could be tried under harsher section 304 culpable homicide not amounting to murder instead of milder provision of 304a causing death by rash and negligent act
8958635 not only that the experts have replied in negative to the law commissions query saying such accused lack the intention to kill and hence they be tried for causing death by rash and negligent acts attracting maximum punishment of two years term
8958636 every accident is unfortunate but court decisions cannot be guided by emotions

8958654 its one of those things you do and you do and you do and how much you use it is all dependent we have the ability to do it and i feel good about it thats one of the weapons an offensive line has is we know the cadence and they dont if we let them tee off we put our offense at a distinct disadvantage
8958655 if one of my daughters boyfriends turns out to be vegetarian i swear to god id never forgive them
8958656 my biggest nightmare would be if the kids ever came up to me and said dad im a vegetarian then i would sit them on the fence and electrocute them
8958657 i think its a case of live and let live
8958658 i will talk to people about the advantages of vegetarianism and it will upset me if weve had a good conversation and they turn around and say something stupid
8958659 i just read a quote from gordon ramsay if my daughter ever grew up and married a vegetarian id never forgive her
8958660 but even that i would forgive because its not my affair its not up to me if he talks stupid or not
8958661 one of the first things i do like most people now is to look at the ingredients
8958662 my youngest daughter is vegan so im often looking for vegan food and i need to know if theres any dairy products its a good thing you do it for the right reasons
8958663 id be happier if everyone was vegetarian the planet would be better off for it
8958664 if one of my daughters boyfriends turns out to be vegetarian i swear to god id never forgive them
8958665 my biggest nightmare would be if the kids ever came up to me and said dad im a vegetarian then i would sit them on the fence and electrocute them
8958666 but i remember catching the ball and falling over the fence and thinking i dont want to land on my head so i tried to do some sort of flip
8958667 youve got to take it race by race theres no point dwelling on what happenend i think the weekend was just frustrating in the fact that the decisions we made were the wrong ones i guess after such a successful season so far we probably deserve one that didnt go our way
8958668 were still very confident weve still got a big lead forty three points in two races is pretty hard to soak up but im sure theyre going to do the best they can to try and take over that all in all were pretty motivated
8958669 were going to carry this great positive attitude from the team great momentum that were carrying and translate that onto the racetrack all weekend
8958670 im not asking for a tip but where is my tip
8958671 i was not important enough to talk to a manager

8958685 sarah is a small town mayor running alaska as if its a small town
8958686 mccain is out of his mind he has no foreign policy experience and shell help because shes been fishing in canada
8958687 conservatives will be thrilled with this pick gov palin is a down the line mainstream conservative who will energize the base and reach across party lines attracting women voters independents and blue collar democrats
8958688 governor palin is a terrific contrast to the all washington ticket of obama biden she is a wonderful contrast to biden and a truly outside the beltway pick
8958689 obama cant be president because he is too young an too inexperienced guess that line is out the window
8958690 mentors contract renewal of the subscribenet service for the fifth year represents mentors continued commitment to providing its customers with the best possible access to their electronic assets now and into the future
8958691 we look forward to continuing our long standing relationship with mentor and supporting their phased approach to growing their current services and implementing additional services
8958692 thats fine but thats what obama wants to run on because more people agree with his values and common sense when it comes to policy

8958694 sometimes i sell a bundle of grass for two small cups of maize meal that i use to prepare porridge for the children

8958696 we collect anything edible i collect empty tins also and sell them to one company that gives n 150 for a full lorry
8958697 we have received reports that people are in need and as soon as the nitty gritty is sorted out we will start with the distribution of food starting with households where the situation is known to be desperate
8958698 on this labor day we are sending a loud wake up call to management americans managers need to learn what business theyre in this is a service industry american is reliant on its workforce you dont have to work at this airline to see how deeply morale has suffered in recent years
8958699 everyone knows that the industry is in a difficult period but our members have kept the planes flying found ways to boost productivity and produce new revenue rather than being treated as partners we have been patronized
8958700 flight attendants are earning 30 percent less than they did five years ago and many are struggling meanwhile top executives are patting themselves on the back and padding their bank accounts
8958701 airline executives have used the soaring cost of jet fuel as an excuse not to negotiate a deal we can live with
8958702 but they wouldnt bargain with any of us when oil was 70 a barrel the problem isnt high oil prices the problem is our executives lack of integrity american airlines employees deserve better and our unions will demand it
8958703 for the first time when i left houston i felt like i was missing something growing up i was always extremely happy and at peace in the woods and thats where i am now with football when youre the first pick overall there is a sense of chasing it the pressure of living up to what you know you can do ive stopped chasing it football is coming to me and im running with it

8958707 parks have some opportunities we have facilities to gather people
8958708 will sunday be strange i am 100 for villa thats all ill be doing that wont be strange at all will the fans be behind me all i can do is give 100 for the club that is all the fans will want to see anyway i am sure that will be enough
8958709 do i feel hung out to dry over what has happened that is what the football business is all about i am contracted to villa they set a fee and it wasnt matched rules are rules
8958710 the manager knows i will be giving 100 for himself and the club and that will be fine for everyone its nice hearing your team mates wanting you to stay
8958711 do i have a good relationship with martin oneill i dont think so
8958712 but of course i will shake his hand i am a calm man and i do not have any problems with him about that i had a good relationship with martin oneill before this summer and i was surprised at what has been said but i insist that i have not spoken to him since april
8958713 but i do not believe there will be any problem shaking hands we can do it we know that barry is a good player very good for them we will try to contain him on the pitch and not talk too much about other things that have happened in the summer
8958714 the woodbury police are excited because they got something thats more serious than a cat up a tree
8958715 this is a very unique case and frankly i dont know the ramifications of anything yet
8958716 were just always looking out the windows the whole neighborhood in general is feeling the same way
8958717 that to me is ridiculous i dont understand how that can happen
8958718 hes going to have to bang a little bit to get in at me and hopefully ill be able to wake up by then
8958719 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl told him that he had come up with a plan on how to murder someone
8958720 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl wanted to find an adult male who lived by himself and within walking distance of the defendants house
8958721 mr busskohl stated that he would then either stab the potential victim in the chest or slash his throat mr busskohl told mr eischens that he would then either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart
8958722 im not even sure i would have gone through with it
8958723 the evidence i received he busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
8958724 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
8958725 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
8958726 i didnt even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news
8958727 what bothers me is if you throw a rock hes about four blocks away
8958728 which is a substantial step toward and more than preparation for the commission of the crime
8958729 but if we have somebody thats just simply preparing to commit the crime and does not take a substantial step toward committing that crime we cant charge an attempt and thats what this is all about
8958730 if it wasnt for his friend and the grace of god thatd be it
8958731 the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington
8958732 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8958733 as of august 28 2008 i am officially voting for barack obama
8958734 after i got past all the rumors about him i was finally able to really look into the man he really is
8958735 for the first time i actually felt like there was some hope at the end of the tunnel
8958736 i was tired of just taking what the republican party kept saying at face value
8958737 it was very emotional i never thought i would feel this way after hearing him speak
8958738 i have at long last decided to support this man for president
8958739 fresh ideas his ability to unite the parties and his charisma
8958740 ironically what i found most impressive was the loftiness of his speech
8958741 it really sealed the deal that we do need to have change right now and that he is the better person than john mccain
8958742 i would liken the 10 year term to what john kennedy said when he wanted to put a man on the moon
8958743 i didnt think obama could top hillary or bill or even himself for that matter
8958744 never in my life have i been more on a mission to get someone elected to the presidency
8958745 this speech is going to be something that my future children study in school and ask me what it was like to be alive when barack obama was president
8958746 taking precautionary measures right now are the best way to minimize the impact gustav will have on your home and family
8958747 while britains athletes may have won more medals than usual they must remember that they are tainted with the blood of tibetans falun gong practitioners and roman catholic priests
8958748 if you are looking for young heroes and role models forget the highly paid athletes who leave their consciences at passport control and consider the sacrifice being made by our soldiers in afghanistan and iraq
8958749 boris was forced to go to beijing to collect the olympic flag
8958750 i would have told the international olympic committee to put it in the post
8958751 brian coleman is entitled to his views on the olympics which is a matter of taste and political opinion but it is preposterous to suggest that boris johnson was forced to go to beijing
8958752 he rejects absolutely any suggestion that britains athletes are tainted with the blood of tibetans falun gong practitioners and roman catholic priests it is offensive to suggest so when these fine young men and women are not only doing britain proud but are helping to open china to the world and the world to china
8958753 the mayors support for our athletes as they return from beijing has been totally undermined by one of his senior appointments mr coleman has gone out of his way to personally attack insult and disparage the remarkable achievements of the british team
8958754 mr colemans gross insult does nothing but undermine and embarrass the city we should be giving our young athletes all the resources and support possible not rubbishing and going out of our way to put them down
8958755 my biggest concern with the income data is that were getting off to a weak start to the third quarter
8958756 the income numbers are a reminder that the economy is going to look worse before it gets better
8958757 it is not our intention to interfere with an investigation
8958758 nobody in my office nor myself has ever been contacted by any investigatory agency
8958759 we have never not once been contacted let me be clear by any federal investigator or any investigator of any kind
8958760 until that happens we will still see fraud on us cards happening in our shops and our cash machines and also fraud on our cards happening in the us
8958761 will the media refuse to look into her past like theyve refused to look into obamas
8958762 oh im waiting for the remaining goldfishes to die so that i can stop rearing goldfishes
8958763 el argumento planteado es que si no se pudiesen vender los juegos de segunda mano m s gente comprar a juegos nuevos y las ganancias de las editoras y desarrolladoras ser an mayores
8958764 im looking at him right now and i see perfection
8958765 yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
8958766 this is a great moment the torch has been passed from the kennedy dynasty to the new obama dynasty
8958767 heres why the ami considers the austrian school as monetarily illiterate and not having done their homework
8958768 mom why should we listen to you except they grew up and now listen to me
8958769 whether the theme of the paradise exile and return is interpreted literally or metaphorically the idea remains one of the major motifs in the development of the reggae lyric
8958770 rastafarian ideology provided a clear and appealing cosmolology for the reggae artist with highly metaphorical frequently poetic discourse which fed easily into a working class discourse that was already rich in proverbial and biblical resonance
8958771 king of ethiopia king of kings lord of lords and conquering lion of the tribe of judah
8958772 some say its just a part of it weve got to fulfill the book
8958773 youd better stay up because this is a history maker
8958774 it is assumed by the general public that new drugs have been put through exhaustive trials and found to be safe and effective
8958775 dont take any new drug unless you absolutely have to for two years
8958776 apparently safe based on incomplete information and more effective than a placebo
8958777 as part of the mechanism of anemia the body locks away iron
8958778 iron is a component of the hemoglobin molecule that carries oxygen in red blood cells
8958779 iron may also have some role in helping tumours grow
8958780 i dont want people to get the wrong idea some kinds of anemia are definitely bad severe anemia is definitely bad blood transfusions and drugs can be are very useful in moderate doses in these cases
8958781 but pushing the hemoglobin all the way up to normal in people with chronic disease looks to be harmful

8958813 we have been importing grain from australia for the last 200 years or so im not sure how much more if any we may need now

8958816 at the moment its the end of august and were getting moderate pollen counts which is normal for this time of year
8958817 last year we had low pollen counts because of the drought
8958818 people tend to blame the poor old wattle tree because they can see it but that doesnt blow so far
8958819 its trees like silver birch which throws its pollen very early on before there are any leaves on the tree that are the main problem
8958820 we advise asthma sufferers to reduce or avoid outdoor activities in the morning when pollen counts are highest to prevent attacks
8958821 in addition there are many reports of asthma epidemics being associated with thunderstorms because of the airflow patterns which tend to concentrate allergens in a band of air at ground level
8958822 this means that spring storms can cause major asthma problems people with asthma who know they are sensitive to pollens should be particularly careful when storms are predicted on days with high pollen counts

8958825 i do believe that mccain has to do something to reshuffle the cards shake up the establishment do something unexpected and governor palin has all the kinds of things that mccain might see as a way to shake things up i think her selection would be something similar to dan quayle dan quayle proved to be sort of an embarrassment as a campaigner being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough now mondale tried to shake things up by going with geraldine ferraro she proved to be a disaster as a running mate and as a campaigner she was absolutely awful and so i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left
8958826 the landscape is littered with the bodies of those who have crossed sarah
8958827 some will say i am inexperienced but i could not ask for a better running mate to expose me to the depths of sacrifice required for a life in public service and unlike our opponents i will be will be looking up to the president not the other way around

8958850 if the united states had genuine broadband competition internet providers would not be able to profit from artificial scarcity they would invest in their networks to keep pace with consumer demand

8959075 people here read local newspapers because they get the information of the local happenings besides getting information of the neighboring places all the small and big news what is happening is that every nook and corner of the district is also covered by the local papers so the people go for it

8959077 guns won t solve our problems they will only destroy the society we should restore peace in the society through the pen
8959078 we have decided to protest today outside central zoo authority because people generally believe that animals are very happy staying in a zoo which is not true wild animals should be set free in their natural surroundings and all these incidents of killing of animals in zoo and the recent incident of deaths of two bears in nagaland has forced us to stage a protest today

8959087 i joined indian police service in 1972 i became the first woman in the country to do so regrettably earlier the police department had dissuaded many other girls who wanted to do this saying that it was very scary since i was a champion they couldn t do it to me champions can t be scared of anything i scared them when i told them that you would be snatching away my constitutional right if you try to stop me from doing what i want to do in life
8959088 then they welcomed me they said that i will have to open fire lodge tear gas shells disperse crowds arrest hardened criminals and shoot to kill i asked them i will do it wont you train me i was already a tennis player i had great stamina great mental tenacity and endurance so when they started to train me they realized that they had got a real champion who loved all sorts of training i was a very bright ncc cadet right from the beginning

8959090 if inner city apartment living is your thing there are a couple of alternatives worth your time for an entry level option try a one bedder with a carpark and a sale price around the 370 000 to 390 000 mark the car accommodation can be sold or rented separately for a healthy quick return or retained to take advantage of further growth if you looking for owner occupier stock lower level units in the old admiralty towers complex are hard to beat while they may not have the flash bang impact of some of the newer high rise projects your home looks down both stretches of the river with easy access to both the city centre and the wilds of fortitude valley 700 000 odd could be well spent here
8959091 if it does work out well it will probably be a small plus for us
8959092 obviously if it doesnt work out well then the republicans are going to have a problem

8959102 the cabin crew reported that shortly after the bang was heard oxygen masks fell from most of the personal service units in the ceiling above passenger seats and in the toilets
8959103 most passengers started using the oxygen masks soon after they dropped
8959104 some crew located a spare passenger mask and sat in between passengers while others went to a crew jumpseat at an exit and one used a mask in a toilet
8959105 if you are going hold an international level fair you have to talk at a european level at the very least
8959106 ive got a 3 year old daughter and i figure that every plane we build engines for has someone with a 3 year old daughter riding on it
8959107 it cant be more than four 1 000ths of an inch out of round
8959108 this has never been four 1 000ths of an inch out of true in the four years ive been measuring these
8959109 i came from northrop grumman in palmdale california where i was working on the b 2 bomber
8959110 that plane which used stealth technology was as high tech as you can get but someone else wrote the assembly process here i write the process at the mechanic level there i was on a team but i also had a supervisor he had a boss and there were other bosses above him in two years of working there i never saw the plant manager every day my boss would just hand me my job i had no input at all none im much happier here i can change what goes on
8959111 my old faithful working as a laborer at a shipyard
8959112 but i never even gave it any thought i didnt know if i was up for it but a job i was up for that
8959113 the interview now that was one heck of an experience
8959114 it lasted eight hours i talked to five different people i participated in three group activities with other job candidates i even had to do a presentation i had 15 minutes to prepare a 5 minute presentation
8959115 my first six months at the plant were something i wasnt prepared for
8959116 we had to come up with a schedule we had the chance to order tools tool carts and so on we had to figure out how the assembly line to make the engine should flow we were put on councils for every part of the business
8959117 i was never valued that much as an employee in my life
8959118 i had never been at the point where i couldnt wait to get to work but here i couldnt wait to get to work every day thats no bs
8959119 but weve had training on how to reach consensus weve had training on how to live with ideas that we might not necessarily agree with
8959120 all the things you normally fuss and moan about to yourself and your buddies well we have a chance to do something about them
8959121 you dont hoard your skills that way when im on vacation the low pressure turbine can still be built without me
8959122 there should be no reason for barriers between people here
8959123 one we have a layerless organization there is just one classification of worker two people are paid according to their skills three everyone is an faa power plant mechanic meaning that he or she comes highly skilled and four this is a team environment that requires a highly involved workforce
8959124 you have to be above the bar in all 11 of the areas helping skills team skills communication skills diversity flexibility coaching ability work ethic and so forth even if just one thing out of the 11 knocks you down you dont come to work here
8959125 we ask for instance if there were something in your past that you could change what would it be
8959126 we wouldnt hire donald trump here but that doesnt mean he isnt good at what he does
8959127 but when you put someone with the new guy you cant expect that person to get as far as he would if you put him with an experienced guy as the materials council rep keith did the right thing by confronting me and i did the right thing by confronting him back by explaining it was friendly
8959128 an employee came to me and said paula you realize that you dont need to follow up with us to make sure were doing what we agreed to do
8959129 how do we do that engine which weve never done before and do it fast we were going to do it with just one new team and with no new hires
8959130 they have been producing the cfm engine for eight weeks
8959131 in evendale we have been producing it for years and years and in durham they are already producing it for 12 to 13 less cost than we are here
8959132 and we call it an a decision it was a unilateral decision i dont make very many of those and when i do make one everyone at the plant knows it
8959133 i make maybe 10 or 12 of those a year
8959134 they sell for less this year than last year and that has been true for the past five years in a row to sustain our business we have to reduce our costs every year the nice thing is that here instead of one person saying mush harder everyone has 15 people looking at them 15 peers to whom they are accountable
8959135 each team or group of teams may be optimizing itself but whats the right way to optimize the plant if weve optimized each engine program how do i free up resources for growth and for process improvement
8959136 they financial incentives are not part of the culture at ge aircraft engines
8959137 then as new work becomes available we have the potential to bid on it internally and to get it
8959138 the idea of being the boss having a big office or whatever doesnt turn me on
8959139 it never really has ive had a nice big office and i felt uncomfortable removed from what was going on but i know im the boss here it comes out in funny ways i hadnt been here long before i started hearing the phrase paula says after awhile it became a joke
8959140 i had never worked in this kind of environment before
8959141 the workforce is highly skilled and highly motivated and highly demanding as well it is demanding of information time resources results i consider that a good thing because a lot of managers ive talked to are lulled to sleep by the layers of insulation around them but with 170 people reporting to you you really have to balance face time with getting your work done
8959142 has been the most challenging four years of my life and also the most rewarding to do it well requires a different level of listening skills significantly different
8959143 more and more of what i do involves listening to people to teams to councils to ideas trying to find common themes
8959144 the beauty of this job is that there are very few limits that youd associate with its structure or its responsibilities
8959145 when there were some big budget challenges we wanted to reduce costs at this facility by 1 2 million and we wanted a plan to do it in a few days id been through this kind of thing many times in many different places but id never been through it here before
8959146 at the time this plant wasnt very cost conscious so i formed an expense council to educate people at the facility about why keeping track of expenses is important and how expenses fit into the total scheme of things
8959147 it was a real rudder change to get the plant to focus on expenses
8959148 that was the year when everyone decided that i was a cheap skate but in a place like this you have to trust people to a degree that you never would have before
8959149 when i had a new plan i called my boss back and said take that first plan i sent you and throw it in the trash
8959150 we are very close to producing twice the output of cf6s from this plant with the same number of employees as when i came here
8959151 they are the best in the ge aircraft engines division
8959152 they used to go up on ladders to work on those engines
8959153 the ge90 teams said could we build some platforms i said thats a great idea once we decided on a design it took a month to build the first one and now we have two not having to climb up and down the ladder or to move it each time you need to reach something new has reduced the assembly time of the engine by eight hours
8959154 we have method engineers and process engineers and you give them a job and they hem and haw for a year and then they come up with something
8959155 now down in durham you dont hear about process improvement they are constantly swinging away at it every time i go down there im amazed they have their washers all sorted into holders like poker chips sorted into trays you can easily get the washer you want its things like that they dont ask anybody they just go and do it down there you can get more going in a weeks time than you can here in a year
8959156 i think what theyve discovered in durham is the value of the human being

8959209 improving crystal quality and purity leads to explosive materials that are safer less likely to react violently when subjected to mechanical impact or heat
8959210 the design of custom solvents through first principles modeling opens up new possibilities for the dissolution of materials that are hard to dissolve
8959211 approximately 12 million people a year in the u s seek medical care for impacted or excessive cerumen
8959212 this leads to nearly 8 million cerumen removal procedures by health care professionals developing practical clinical guidelines for physicians to understand the harm vs benefit profile of the intervention was essential
8959213 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove cerumen from the ears
8959214 this can result in further impaction and other complications to the ear canal
8959215 the complications from cerumen impaction can be painful and ongoing including infections and hearing loss
8959216 it is hoped that these guidelines will give clinicians the tools they need to spot an issue early and avoid serious outcomes
8959217 it is operating not as normal but pretty close to it
8959218 we just want to get it up and running as soon as we can but its very hard to put a timeline on it right now

8959223 proving that we can directly measure amyloid beta in the human brain is an important step forward for both clinical and basic research and that may be true not just in alzheimers disease but also in other serious neurological disorders
8959224 we cant at this point rule out a very early spike in amyloid right after a brain injury
8959225 the results have potentially important clinical implications because the measurement of amyloid beta in the human brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well brain cells are communicating with each other even in very sick patients
8959226 if the results are validated in further studies this may assist physicians in making important patient management decisions in patients with acute neurological disorders
8959227 the new data fit well with the previous results in mice because improved neurological status is likely to go along with increased communication between brain cells
8959228 we havent measured how brain injury affects amyloid beta inside cells nor have we determined whether brain injury affects the ability of amyloid beta to form small aggregates that may be especially harmful
8959229 our ultimate goal is to develop interventions that we can apply after a traumatic brain injury to improve outcomes and reduce the long term risk of alzheimers
8959230 hey this is so funny but someone told me youre actually 43 i totally dont care older men are totally sexy but how old are you really

8959232 as they capture mosquitoes that have had a blood meal and thus more opportunity to become infected
8959233 each female mosquito has the potential to produce about 200 eggs and she can have as many as five cycles so when we capture a gravid mosquito that can remove as many as 500 females
8959234 sampling the species in urban environments has been a challenge until studies on its oviposition cues allowed the development of gravid female traps that collect mostly females that previously have blood fed and therefore had a chance to become infected

8959236 arsenic poisoning is behind many instances of ill health in southern asia including a rising number of cancer cases developing a low cost method of decontaminating ground water that is laced with high levels of arsenic is a key challenge for sustainable agriculture there
8959237 while there are some techniques available for treating relatively small quantities of water there has until now been no viable technology available for decontaminating groundwater on a large scale that can ensure safe irrigation and potable water supply
8959238 this project developed by queens is the only method which is eco friendly easy to use and deliverable to the rural community user at an affordable cost
8959239 from its inception we have had the vital support of indian based stakeholders such as village councils and local financial institutions this has been vital as they are the authorities who monitor the water supply and distribution in rural areas and provide micro credit to the local farmers
8959240 with their help we now have a solution which is transferable to many areas in need across asia

8959244 the commission has opened an own initiative investigation under eu antitrust rules into the intended cooperation agreement between ba iberia and aa
8959245 the european commission have rightly begun an investigation under their own initiative because they understand that consumers will be worse off if this alliance proceeds
8959246 we assist our passengers for lax that are disabled were not properly trained if theres an emergency we dont know what to do we need proper benefits for our families we only have it for ourselves and we need to be able to pay for our rent and living expenses as well as everything else
8959247 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8959248 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8959249 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8959250 we dont foresee any sanctions decided on by the european council
8959251 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
8959252 we did have lots of contacts with georgia over a long period of time

8959261 these bowl shaped depressions reflect the former location of relatively pure glacier ice
8959262 this late stage snow could accumulate in depressions on the crater wall and in favorable microclimate settings melt to produce the observed gullies and fans
8959263 are exciting because they establish a spatial link between recent gullies and accumulation of glacier ice strengthening the case for surface melt water flow in the formation of gullies on mars
8959264 recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that a single genetic event in the map kinase signaling pathway may be sufficient for thyroid cell transformation and tumor development
8959265 thyroid cancer is associated with exposure to external or internal ionizing radiation elucidation of mechanisms of radiation induced cancer in humans especially early steps and pathways has potential implications for epidemiological risk analyses early clinical diagnosis and chemopreventive interventions
8959266 that means that a younger person living close to the bombing site would be more likely to have adult onset thyroid cancer having ret ptc rearrangements
8959267 it could be either by direct dna damage or by other pathways such as a result of radiation induced genomic instability
8959268 this new finding may help to explain why the clock is so far reaching in its effects on the organism
8959269 we found that some 25 percent of the genes in our model organism appear to be under clock control i wasnt suspecting anything remotely like that
8959270 it appears the clock influences a number of biological processes including cell cycling protein metabolism and varied signaling processes
8959271 but perhaps the most important role weve seen so far is the clocks role in ribosome biogenesis
8959272 the resulting molecular mechanism or genetic network for the clock identified by this mode guided discovery process will have a broad appeal to geneticists physiologists and those with an interest in signaling pathways
8959273 the methods used to characterize what makes a biological clock tick will have numerous applications in finding genetic networks describing other complex traits in many biological systems
8959274 tell rhythms of life the biological clocks that control the daily lives of every living thing
8959275 the resistance to this in the scientific community is enormous
8959276 for the first time we have a student who is using linguistic tools that have normally been applied to humans now being applied to non humans this is a move toward using the kinds of methodology that are appropriate in ape language based on 1993 monograph language comprehension in ape and child
8959277 this is a long term project starting from the beginning of where we have data
8959278 all of this is contextualized with our current research and larger programs such as forgiveness research the students are looking at the earlier data while investigators are looking at new data
8959279 this paper serves as an investigation into the early ontogeny of these kinds of competencies
8959280 these papers will eventually be assembled in a larger volume to look at issues in the development of forgiveness and other cultural dimensions of the apes lives
8959281 she was using language to get at what she wanted
8959282 she is very very clever and is fully capable of following the conversation the same way a human does this tells me that panbanishas knowledge of language is far beyond understanding the words to understanding how to use them in a conversation to get what she wants
8959283 one of the things janni has affirmed and affirmed in a way the lay person can understand is the aspect of turn taking if there is anything universal in human language its turn of talk
8959284 the fact that panbanisha has done this and its accessible even to an untrained reviewer i think is an important aspect of her paper she has looked at the whole social action and the meaning ideational flow going back and forth is obvious
8959285 originally repetition was thought of something that happens normally in human language
8959286 traditionally repetition in ape communicative behaviors is assumed to be proof that they dont have language its a kind of dichotomy or unfairness
8959287 hers will be the first ph d produced in ape language since the research moved to iowa

8959289 we were disappointed not to find a smoking gun that would explain the common association between obesity and asthma
8959290 however this research points us to other possibilities that future research should examine
8959291 we hypothesized that the low grade systemic inflammation present in obesity would augment the inflammation of asthma a synergistic effect
8959292 or alternatively that the inflammation of obesity might affect the airways independently an additive effect perhaps resulting in mixed airway inflammation
8959293 what we found was that although inflammatory cells and other biomarkers of inflammation were increased there was no significant interaction demonstrated between obesity and asthma
8959294 this does not change the fact that there is a well established link between asthma and obesity sometimes a negative result is important and the results add to our body of knowledge regarding the obesity asthma link now we need to look in other directions for the answers
8959295 we did not look at this in our patients given that asthma is immunologically driven this is a potential avenue for further research
8959296 alternatively it may be that dynamic changes in lung function that occur with episodes of asthma are different with excess body weight

8959315 the reburial has only one aim to cover up newmans homosexuality and to disavow his love for another man
8959316 it is an act of shameless dishonesty and personal betrayal by the gay hating vatican
8959317 i wish with all my heart to be buried in father ambrose st johns grave and i give this as my last my imperative will
8959318 i have ever thought no bereavement was equal to that of a husbands or a wifes but i feel it difficult to believe that any can be greater or anyones sorrow greater than mine
8959319 nothing can justify the vaticans decision to violate newmans categorical and often stated instructions that he be buried alongside ambrose no one gave the pope permission to defy newmans wishes
8959320 they were inseparable they lived together for over 30 years like husband and wife newman was not exactly macho his softer gentler demeanour is what we associate with a gay man and there were allegations during his lifetime about his circle of homosexual friends
8959321 there is no evidence for that whatsoever and everything he newman wrote and said suggests he would have thought homosexuality was immoral not to mention that it was illegal at the time
8959322 theirs was a close friendship that some people are now trying to misrepresent and use for their own purposes
8959323 they clearly had a loving long term same sex relationship it is impossible to know whether this relationship involved sex but abstinence does not alter a persons sexual orientation

8959335 we thought there was going to be a public parliamentary debate about this he told macquarie radio
8959336 that hasnt eventuated and this has gone ahead without any further consultation with the unions since this decision was taken by the government yesterday and our members have just had it up to the neck with it
8959337 wouldnt it be horrible if we were the ones to kill it the show

8959339 make sunday a family night that is rich in pictures and entertainment
8959340 its a show that skewes towards an older demographic to try to push a show towards a younger demographic it doesnt necessarily work
8959341 you always ask what ingredients in a show attract an audience is it the host is it the show itself i think there are times when a format cant be overridden by the stars that you put on it
8959342 dancing traditionally has a much older audience than us i think it may be more a 60 minutes versus dancing battle its certainly a risky move taking it dancing out of tuesday nights

8959350 the cabin crew reported that shortly after the bang was heard oxygen masks fell from most of the personal service units in the ceiling above passenger seats and in the toilets
8959351 most passengers started using the oxygen masks soon after they dropped
8959352 some crew located a spare passenger mask and sat in between passengers while others went to a crew jumpseat at an exit and one used a mask in a toilet

8959356 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
8959357 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
8959358 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
8959359 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
8959360 but you also need to take care of yourself everyone can reduce their risk by taking simple precautions
8959361 wash your hands avoid sick kids and hospitals during flu season consider antiviral agents for prophylaxis and tell your doctor as soon as you feel unwell because there is still a chance to decrease symptoms and prevent hospitalization if you get sick because flu vaccine is not as effective as people have been thinking it is
8959362 to our knowledge this is the first report of a direct association between childhood abuse and asthma and asthma related outcomes
8959363 we wanted to explore whether exposure to stress and violence is associated with an increased risk of asthma in urban children living in puerto rico
8959364 we already know that there is a high prevalence of asthma in puerto rican children and many studies have linked stress and exposure to violence to health problems in childhood including asthma
8959365 children with a history of abuse had higher frequencies of all outcomes of interest than those without a history of abuse
8959366 after adjusting for relevant covariates history of abuse was associated with an approximate doubling of the odds of current asthma healthcare use for asthma and allergic rhinitis
8959367 it is not simply the exposure to a particular stressor but the physiological response to that stressor that predicts physical health outcomes
8959368 latino culture places an emphasis on certain values and social supports that may buffer the effects of poverty and community violence experienced by children in puerto rico

8959372 because of the large deformation signals from the dike intrusion we needed to do some detailed detective work to prove the existence of this slow earthquake
8959373 we used state of the art insar satellite data to constrain the dike source and that allowed us to demonstrate the existence of the slow earthquake motions recorded by the gps stations on kilaueas flank
8959374 a dike intrusion could be seen with the seismic monitoring network the tiltmeters and the gps network but these slow earthquakes can only be seen with the gps network
8959375 smoking during pregnancy is a double edged sword with respect to sids
8959376 not only does it raise a mothers likelihood of having a preterm baby who is already among the most vulnerable to sids but it increases the infants susceptibility to sids even further
8959377 preterm babies are known to have increased breathing difficulties in proportion to their prematurity and cigarette smoke is known to increase apneas in full term babies
8959378 but until now cigarette smoke exposure and preterm birth have not been investigated together with respect to their potential effects on respiratory dysfunction
8959379 our study shows that preterm infants make incomplete and or delayed recovery from interruptions in breathing
8959380 this has clear implications for their risk of sids but there is even still another reason for concern even after the risk of sids has passed inability or delayed recovery from repeated low oxygen episodes can also be detrimental to brain development there is increasing evidence that infants exposed to prenatal cigarette smoke are at high risk for developmental and behavioral disorders
8959381 the study has shown for the first time that metabolic response to brain tumor treatment can be detected earlier and faster by metabolic imaging instead of through structural imaging or assessment of the neurological status of a patient
8959382 frequent use of this type of imaging may be a useful tool to follow a patients response to chemotherapy for malignant brain tumors
8959383 it gives us the ability to identify treatment failure early and more time to alter a patients treatment plan before the disease progresses
8959384 it is apparent that the stage of disease incubation in infected donors played a large role in the likelihood of transmission the longer that bse or scrapie had been carried by donors the greater the likelihood of the disease being transmitted with transfusions of infected blood
8959385 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection
8959386 while it may not correlate directly to what happens in the human population due to factors such as species differences in genetic susceptibility to disease it provides greater insight into the role of how vcjd may be carried through infected blood by understanding how vcjd can be transmitted through blood transfusions we can ensure the most effective control measures to minimise human to human infection
8959387 emergency physicians can and do perform miracles every day but taking on the full time medical care for 46 million uninsured americans is one miracle even we cannot perform access to care in the emergency department is no substitute for the comprehensive healthcare reform policy that should be at the heart of the platform of any presidential campaign

8959395 we are especially grateful to channel 7 for their consideration towards mark in recent times
8959396 our research shows that the nter nt emergency response has caused immediate and lasting harm
8959397 as medical professionals we are deeply concerned about the impacts
8959398 community members expressed feelings of loss of responsibility loss of control loss of power and a hardening of mistrust towards the australian government and dominant western culture in australia
8959399 this has resulted in feelings of anger and powerlessness it has caused cultural social and emotional harm
8959400 our interviews very powerfully evoked a sense a regressing to the old days many people referred to the feelings of shame humiliation and loss of dignity that particularly characterised an earlier protectionist period when the government controlled every aspect of indigenous peoples lives

8959539 much of what physicists have learned in the twentieth century suggests that a huge amount of our universe is unseen that we live in a dark cosmos in fact what we can see a book a cat or our planet makes up only 5 of the universe the invisible part comes in two varieties dark matter and dark energy one holds the universe together while the other tears it apart the make up of these forces has been a mystery but the latest discoveries of experimental physics have brought us closer to that knowledge

8959550 loaded has been something ive had for years when guns n roses ended the first thing i did was return to studying and loaded started then wed be going off and touring japan during spring break when velvet revolver started and took off that became my priority but loaded would still do charity gigs at christmas i didnt think thered be time for any more but with the scott weiland situation its worked out amazingly good it gives velvet revolver time to make sure we pick the right guy and its given loaded time to record an album i had a great bunch of songs which were different from velvet revolver and im not kidding its the most inspired album ive been involved with since i was in my 20s
8959551 i feel at home with the bass and i feel its what im best and most professional at but ive been singing and playing guitar and drums for years too so i just see them as other ways to express the same passion i have in the music as a singer i dont have a massive range but i know where that range is and how i can use it without being repetitive i did a lot of damage to my sinuses in the late 80s but after i had surgery to fix it it really helped my voice

8959583 in de winter van 1937 werd in vlissingen een ouder echtpaar vermoord de uitbaters van het caf keersluis ondanks een uitgebreide speuractie van de politie werd het misdrijf nooit opgelost de schrijver heeft een minutieus onderzoek uitgevoerd naar alles wat met de zaak te maken had afkomst achtergronden geruchten doodlopende sporen buren en relaties alles wat maar enigszins in verband met het echtpaar kon worden gebracht daarbij krijgt de lezer een goed beeld van de vlissinger samenleving in de jaren dertig van de 20e eeuw de schrijver had niet de pretentie de moord te kunnen oplossen het was hem onder andere te doen om duidelijk te maken wat voor impact zon moord heeft op een toch vrij gesloten gemeenschap jaren later werd er nog over gepraat de schrijver is zeker geslaagd op boeiende en prettige wijze wordt verslag gedaan van het onderzoek waarbij men zich erover kan verbazen dat er nog zo veel bewaard is gebleven vele functionele fotos verluchtigen het geheel dat vooral voor mensen uit de stad en uit de streek interessant is
8959584 in the case of donna challice the court decided that we had to have evidence from either eye witnesses or cctv to ensure that the person taken to court was in fact the person responsible
8959585 now if we find a contaminated bin under the terms of section 46 of the environmental protection act we serve a notice on every adult person in the household concerned
8959586 this instructs them what they should put in their bins
8959587 if we do bill them and they dont pay they will not be prosecuted under section 46 but can be prosecuted for non payment of a bill which is much easier to prove and will be easier to enforce in the courts
8959588 it says it all that under this government hard working households who put their bins out on the wrong day get clobbered with larger fines than shoplifters
8959589 if labour is not imposing bin fines its forcing bin cuts and introducing bin taxes this will be hard to stomach for the public who are already struggling with the spiralling cost of living
8959590 people genuinely want to improve recycling and go green but labours bin policies will harm the environment by causing a surge in fly tipping and fuelling public resentment at town hall bin bullies
8959591 council tax has doubled under labour and all the public have got in return are cutbacks to local services
8959592 putting in place financial penalties for putting rubbish in the wrong bin is unnecessary and will catch lots of innocent people who make an honest mistake
8959593 councils should remember that they work for their constituents not the other way around and stop treating ordinary residents like criminals
8959594 this is absolute nonsense how are they going to police it what if someones bins are sabotaged

8959605 this agreement will enhance our already aggressive efforts to be responsible environmental stewards
8959606 the conservatives keep talking about public pensions and how they need reforming with the lgps they have a real opportunity to show their intent
8959607 they control the majority of local councils and could put a stop to their councillors joining the scheme you cant criticise the level of employer contributions in the scheme while you are at westminster and then have your councillors signing up to it across the rest of the country
8959608 we are extremely concerned about the level of employer contributions paid in to the lgps these are very high and are partially funded by the council taxpayer
8959609 we are more concerned now that we are realising how many councillors are becoming members
8959610 it comes down to a matter of conscience and in good conscience councillors should not join the scheme they are not actual employees and they already get paid an allowance for providing a public service

8959616 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden on to hard pressed british families and businesses
8959617 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8959618 the government are talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8959619 the estimate of green taxes is wrong as it includes taxes used to fund core public services rather than simply offsetting the cost of co2
8959620 the burden varies significantly between suburban rural areas and urban districts
8959621 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden onto hard pressed british families and businesses

8959638 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
8959639 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
8959640 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
8959641 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
8959642 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
8959643 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
8959644 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
8959645 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
8959646 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
8959647 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
8959648 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
8959649 i think people like madonna do everyone a fucking disservice running round in a leotard at her fucking age talking about nothing but fucking dancing and dont give me your one documentary on where you got your orphan from the only child who didnt have aids in the orphanage she is just the most obnoxious waste of millions of dollars i have ever seen it is just such an insult to every fucking woman on the planet she could be sponsoring the artistic careers of 10 000 women right now

8959666 they have to balance it in a way that republicans can get away from a little bit

8959668 obama would need someone who has the credentials to draft and push through congress a healthcare plan
8959669 he cant make the same mistake clinton did by giving that task to his wife he needs someone who has status and strong credentials with members of congress
8959670 this would have gone to john edwards had he not imploded maybe hell pick a woman for this spot
8959671 hopefully obama will look at someone like hawaiis sen daniel akaka who serves on the energy and natural resources committee and is sensitive to many of the issues like offshore drilling
8959672 or new mexico sen jeff bingaman who chairs the energy and natural resources committee maybe he can tap al gore

8959696 caught up in the complex web of intrigue masterminded by william stephenson the legendary canadian spymaster who outmaneuvered the state department and managed to create an elaborate clandestine organization whose purpose was to weaken the isolationist forces in america and influence u s policy in favor of britain
8959697 tall handsome and intelligent dahl had all the makings of an ideal operative a courageous officer wounded in battle smashing looking in his dress uniform he was everything england could have asked for as a romantic representative of their imperiled island he was also arrogant idiosyncratic and incorrigible and probably the last person anyone would have considered reliable enough to be trusted with anything secret above all however dahl was a survivor when he got into trouble he was shrewd enough to make himself useful to british intelligence providing them with gossipy items that proved he had a nose for scandal and the writers ear for damning detail already attached to the british air mission in washington he came equipped with the perfect cover story and his easy wit and conspicuous charm guaranteed him entr e to the drawing rooms and bedrooms of the rich and powerful

8959704 was an active voice in american politics and an influential behind the scenes figure in washington but unlike most of the players dahl had encountered in the nations capital he eschewed publicity in print preferring to manipulate people and events from the privacy of his r street study

8959728 my house was burnt ive lost everything i was lucky to escape unhurt
8959729 their passing game was much better and offensively we were able finish on some goals that we dont always finish on so it was nice to see that
8959730 we have a pretty young team we only have three seniors
8959731 we definitely have the depth coming out of that sophomore class
8959732 emily used to be a forward and last year we had her make the transition to outside mid fielder
8959733 it has really helped a lot of times outside mids were not getting down on the crosses and we were not finishing because emily is forward minded she is getting down there broegan came in last year and started as a freshman her speed is just unreal and she is a very hard worker she fights
8959734 i felt confident even though i was a little nervous because it was our first home game
8959735 we passed the ball around well and really accomplished out goals today we started hard from the beginning and kept it going all the way through the game
8959736 we were really working on that because in a couple of other games we broke down a bit and were too quiet out there we try and put a lot of pressure on the other team to keep it on the offensive side we go out there and put everything we have into it
8959737 we always say the easiest way to shut up a high school student is to put them on a soccer field
8959738 we want to change that this year our communication is something we are always drilling communication is constantly happening out there
8959739 it is our second this week so hopefully next week well keep it going it was good to get another win underneath our belt
8959740 justin was down 4 1 in the second set and we talked at the fence for a minute
8959741 i told her its time for you to comeback no more losing and she really turned it around thats the thing about tennis it is very physical but it is also definitely a mental game a lot of our girls struggle with that when someone makes a bad call they have a hard time getting past that but justin did a great job of that she moved on and worried about the next point instead of the past mistakes she made
8959742 this week our team worked with john johnson a little bit he came out here and gave them some pointers and gave them some things to think about while they were playing
8959743 i really saw a change in several of our girls tonight after working with him im really thankful he took the time to volunteer and come out to work with us jacquie and natalie really took a lot of the things he said and put them into practice it was great
8959744 it was nice to see those two start to talk to each other more it is difficult when you are playing outspoken players girls who question you on your lines and things like that they really kept their cool though and tried really hard it was an impressive match to watch
8959745 were excited to get a win i thought the kids played relaxed tonight and came with a positive attitude sometimes its tough to come off a loss like that
8959746 i think it just helps you relax more if you have that lead
8959747 you take a few more risks out on the floor and i thought we were getting good contributions from everyone out there
8959748 it wasnt just one player tonight we were able to use all our hitters
8959749 jessicas very capable of playing well and she was on tonight were hoping thatll carry over to future games
8959750 we are in the wilderness because we walked away from the limited government principles that minted the republican congress
8959751 the american people did not quit on the contract with america we did
8959752 the size of government in the last five years has grown more rapidly than any time since the great society
8959753 thats not the path we should have trod in response to the american people giving us control of both houses of congress in 1994
8959754 if it does work out well it will probably be a small plus for us
8959755 obviously if it doesnt work out well then the republicans are going to have a problem
8959756 its more of a problem if youre the guy living in the
8959757 our concern is for the lives in the storms potential path
8959758 that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes

8959768 as they build these networks they will need to make more improvements or the complaints will persist
8959769 both companies are accustomed to controlling all aspects of the delivery of its products
8959770 it illustrates the culture clash when you create an environment where you share the responsibilities between them then you have problems

8959772 we are not going to go into the details of what customers are talking about
8959773 everyone is interested in figuring out if this is an at amp t or an apple issue

8959890 through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well thats why i stand here tonight because for 232 years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8959891 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more

8959893 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8959894 you have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming because ive seen it because ive lived it
8959895 i always dreamed id be standing next to my friend former denver broncos player floyd little
8959896 one of the greatest gifts of our democracy is the opportunity it offers us every four years to change our course
8959897 its not a guarantee its an opportunity we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama president of the united states of america
8959898 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8959899 why is this election so close well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion
8959900 i think the forces of the status quo are afraid of the change barack obama represents
8959901 his obamas experience has taught him something that career politicians often over look that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governments
8959902 john mccain is the first candidate in history who thinks he can win by telling voters theyre not thinking for themselves
8959903 lets be honest america john mccain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes but were the ones that will pay for his flip flops
8959904 america faces a simple choice do we want more of the same or is it time to change america
8959905 its fitting to have the eyes of the nation on colorado fitting that the change we need in washington starts here in the rocky mountain west
8959906 it was hope that carried the first americans here not knowing what lay ahead but knowing they must go forward
8959907 this election is not about barack obama joe biden or me its about you
8959908 this is our time this is our moment to change the course of history here at the foot of the great rocky mountains we have found leaders to match our mountains
8959909 i am so proud of colorado weve hosted a great convention dont you think
8959910 this year the road to the white house cuts straight through the heart of the american west
8959911 the washington of george bush and john mccain is failing us
8959912 are you ready for the change we need are you ready for barack obama
8959913 only if we elect a bold new president like barack obama can we get america back on track
8959914 we need a president who understands the contributions and values of rural america
8959915 we need a new spirit in washington we need to elect barack obama president of the united states
8959916 we need a president who challenges every american to be their brothers keeper and their sisters keeper a president who will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like the waters of a mighty stream
8959917 we are very very proud that all of you are here
8959918 its been our pleasure to have you as our guests this week and we hope you have gotten to know our great city and our wonderful state of colorado

8959921 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8959922 i think i would remember jennies fist connecting with a part of my body or a part of my face

8959924 i dont even know if it really matters whether she wins or not

8959933 we think boeing has done much to avoid a strike which would be quite costly to both parties
8959934 from what i can see it does look like it should have a good chance of satisfying enough of the workers that it decreases the odds of a strike
8959935 im not going to be there i plan to be at the state fair you can draw your conclusion from that
8959936 they were pretty much hustled off they came right down the ramp jumped in some vans here and off they went

8959938 how can we dance when our earth is turning how do we sleep when our beds are burning
8959939 it was the most collectively exciting eye opening and ultimately saddening experience for us as a band
8959940 they call him the obama kid because he looks like obama thats what they say when obama started to run during the primaries people started to comment and how i should send the pictures to the news
8959941 if obama was a white man he would not be in this position
8959942 and if he was a woman of any color he would not be in this position he happens to be very lucky to be who he is and the country is caught up in the concept
8959943 upcoming new studio xps laptops from dell studio xps 13 and studio xps 15
8959944 in the honest belief that he needed to protect his son
8959945 it is beyond question that by acting in the way that he did mr khan killed mr brown unlawfully and whatever their differences the fact is that mr brown lost his life that is a consequence for which mr khan must be punished with a significant custodial sentence
8959946 what became obvious as the evidence unfolded however is that from time to time despite denials to the contrary both mr brown and his son ashley barker were involved in acts of racial aggression towards members of mr khans family
8959947 a scalable networking pack snp hotfix rollup package is available for windows server 2003
8959948 its now time to watch for buying opportunities and one of the companies on my personal list is brcm whose shares are in buying range right now
8959949 this semiconductor maker is a good choice for investors who would like to add to their information technology position with shares of a first class company
8959950 broadcom located in irvine california designs semiconductors for the wired and wireless communications industry they are a major supplier to apples iphone which has taken the world by storm this past year
8959951 specifically they power the brilliant display screen that has captivated users since the launch of the iphone last year full disclosure ive just picked up my new 3g iphone
8959952 they also provide the chip that delivers the gps navigation in the new iphone the company holds over 2 000 u s and foreign patents and has more than 7 400 pending patent applications
8959953 but broadcom is not just an iphone supplier they also power the motorola tv set top boxes netgear wireless routers bluetooth and blu ray applications digital television voip etc
8959954 there are lots of chipmakers out there but broadcom operates in the areas that offer the highest growth potential and the least commoditization in this sector
8959955 financially the company is solid with annual revenues in 2007 of about 3 8 billion and net income of 213 million 37c a share fully diluted figures in u s dollars
8959956 for the latest quarter ending june 30 broadcom reported net revenue of 1 2 billion an increase of 16 3 over the first quarter of 2008 and up by 33 7 from the 897 9 million reported for the second quarter of 2007
8959957 net income was 134 8 million 25c per share compared with 74 3 million 14c for the first quarter and 34 3 million 6c per share for the second quarter of 2007
8959958 that represents a year over year profit improvement of more than 300 on a per share basis the company also raised guidance for the rest of the year
8959959 broadcom shares traded as high as 43 07 last october so the stock looks inexpensive at this level and value buying right now seems very sensible the 2009 p e estimate is 16 which is reasonable for a high growth business and well below the five year median level of 24 times earnings
8959960 there are also some outstanding legal issues between broadcom and qualcomm but those seem to be going broadcoms way
8959961 while watching the olympics i couldn t stop thinking about the investment opportunities of the various countries participating in the games
8959962 while it is admittedly a stretch let s consider what an etf porfolio of the top ten countries in the beijing olympics medal count would look like
8959963 i hope that while watching the olympic games many investors were also reminded at how the world is changing and why they need a global portfolio to capture value and growth around the world
8959964 the u s did remarkably well across the board underscoring its role as the world s leading investment destination china surged to win the most gold and reach the symbolic level of 100 medals
8959965 quite an achievement that punctuates china s growing heft with the shanghai composite down 55 this year it has come down to earth and is interesting from a valuation perspective
8959966 next comes russia with a performance fueled by a strong olympian tradition and petro dollars but perhaps a bit overshadowed by the georgian fiasco i will take a pass on this one even though it is off 36 since just may
8959967 next is the uk and australia both are financial oriented markets but the uk is having a much harder time coping with its real estate bubble slower growth and a weak sterling
8959968 australia while not cheap has strengthened on the bounce in commodities evidenced by strong profits at bhp and rio tinto we need to keep an eye on more competitive banking market since the top four aussie banks represent 20 of the market s value
8959969 france and germany were neck and neck representing more than half of continental europe s largest companies and market cap germany is facing a sharp slowdown and weak consumer confidence but has some great multinationals like siemens in its etf basket
8959970 i like france primarily because after a slow start president sarkozy is gaining traction in executing some market
8959971 next comes south korea an industrial powerhouse favored partner of china and striving mightily to be noticed on the world stage it has spent a bundle supporting its currency and exports have proved to be resilient
8959972 next is the surprisingly robust performance of italy along with ireland italy has caught my eye as one of the cheapest markets in the world with the added bonus of undertaking significant market reform
8959973 alas the ukraine grabs the number ten slot but without an etf the mantle falls on japan to round out the top ten this is rich in symbolism since japan seems to be struggling and searching for a way to regain its mojo consumer and investor confidence and elusive economic growth
8959974 on the plus side japan etfs offer very high quality multinationals and smaller companies trading collectively at below book value an important advantage of having exposure to japan etfs is that its market is only 29 correlated to the s amp p 500 index
8959975 the commission has opened an own initiative investigation under eu antitrust rules into the intended cooperation agreement between ba iberia and aa
8959976 the european commission have rightly begun an investigation under their own initiative because they understand that consumers will be worse off if this alliance proceeds
8959977 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community where it is in fact a court of nato
8959978 i would rather hear you say that not guilty at the end of the trial than at the beginning
8959979 the political struggle between hamas and fatah has inflicted a great deal of damage on the press in the palestinian territories
8959980 many media have been closed and dozens of journalists have been arrested in the absence of the rule of law they have no way of defending themselves mahmoud abbas and ismael haniyeh cannot remain silent while this goes on it is in their own interest to ensure there is room for free speech
8959981 i spend 26 days in solitary confinement 16 of them in appalling conditions
8959982 i was not allowed to have a mattress and had to sleep on the floor i was interrogated about my work i think i will no longer be able to tackle the subjects i used to write about because they have become taboo which shows how far free expression has deteriorated in the territories
8959983 sarah palin has a fairly compelling personal story and is an attractive woman but has scant political experience zero name recognition outside of political junky circles faces an ethical investigation by her own legislature and will now be forced to run a grueling national campaign despite having an infant child at home
8959984 they really wanted to pick a woman and there were no obvious choices
8959985 biggest political gamble i believe just about in american political history that is not hyberbole i can think of no choice of vp that approaches this
8959986 i cant imagine a woman thats been a governor for a year and a half but to debate joe biden on georgia a remerging russia an emerging china and india on the middle east my god how does she do that
8959987 well sign multi billion contracts but we insist that the factory workers get minimum rights and a cut of the profits they are bringing to all of us lets pay them well with reasonable work hours and an employment contract
8959988 pressure from her staff to fire a state patrolman who is her sisters former husband led the chief of police to resign in disgust
8959989 the simultaneous launch of five satellites is not without its challenges commissioning will be performed from both the rapideye ground station in brandenburg and the sstl mission control centre in guildford the five satellites will gradually disperse from each other following separation from the launch vehicle allowing three satellites to be tracked and operated from brandenburg with the remainder under the control of the guildford operators this method of operation offers the most efficient route to achieving the maximum amount of contact time per satellite during the early days of commissioning following launch as the satellites are gradually manoeuvred into position around the orbit during the commissioning phase the brandenburg ground station will assume full control over the constellation
8959990 sstl long ago established the benefits of small satellite constellations and launched the disaster monitoring constellation in 2002 paving the way for a new paradigm in remote sensing the launch of rapideye will fully realise the business potential of constellations the simultaneous build of five satellites is the largest mission so far in terms of maximising and managing production at sstls guildford facilities expert in house engineering and project management teams worked closely with mda streamlining the design build and test of all five satellite platforms
8959991 building a business case for geospatial information technology a practitioners guide to financial and strategic analysis
8959992 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam
8959993 its not worse which is important now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery
8959994 i will not quit at this moment i will not declare emergency rule i will wait and see tomorrow
8959995 police will still adhere to my earlier order they merely went to post a court order not to clear protesters
8959996 there will be no coup because a coup will not be able to solve the problems
8959997 i am confident that police are able to oversee the situation
8959998 there are now up to three thousand police deployed outside government house
8959999 the duration of the closure will depend on how the situation develops
