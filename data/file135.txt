1350015 theres not just one thing that goes into this decision
1350016 you throw it all in and it comes down to your gut
1350017 theres no doubt were committed to the way we are going
1350018 after my meeting with ownership this week its more evident than ever that theyre committed towards building a young core for lack of a better term the old fashioned way
1350019 so taking that all in youre making a gut call i guess on the fit for what we project our team to be like
1350020 i think its fair to say we did not expect the team to be out of the playoffs in january this year
1350021 i dont we were kidding ourselves into thinking we were world beaters we set realistic expectations
1350022 certainly that enters the equation when youre evaluating the coaching staff and the players but the most important thing for me was going forward
1350023 i want to talk to mike johnston about the possibility of being considered for this role and see where hes at mentally
1350024 well see where that is at once hes had some time to reflect
1350025 were going to take our time go through a process and hopefully get the right guy
1350026 were going to be methodical were not going to rush into anything this is a critical hire well get through the development camp in july and hopefully make the right gut call in the end
1350027 i dont feel today that im ready to compete on the highest level
1350028 not because of the physical things but because i need motivation every day right now i dont feel its there and i dont want to disappoint anybody
1350029 and one of the greatest goaltenders to ever play the game
1350030 i am leaving this game feeling very very happy because of all the memories and all the friendships i have made with all of you
1350031 dom was completely at peace with the decision that he had made

1350036 i simply wanted to make a colorful bright shoe that would go well with the warm weather i made it blue grey and pink so it can work for both genders plus its something you can wear to miami and stay up for three days and still look fresh
1350037 one year ago on the elsa blog perils of being aquarius individuality and more aquarius
1350038 we were thinking if we do get in its going to be i dont know if we can compare it to what the party was like over in moscow and in belarus
1350039 well try our hardest to make it a good one
1350040 this is right up there with one of the great things ive done in life
1350041 finally i had a chance to play the style i was taught to play in russia
1350042 those eight seasons in detroit i played for the red wings that was success that was fun that was unbelievable support from the fans and the coaches and all the staff who was putting the team together it was incredible
1350043 i dont think there was a better playoff pressure player other than maybe rocket richard his championships and statistics speak for themselves and more importantly he was an unselfish teammate
1350044 when i started in this business my mindset was to keep working so i never could have imagined this
1350045 my father had a passion for the game of hockey and was committed to doing whatever it took to improve the game our entire family is very proud
1350046 we have a verbal agreement but nothings on paper yet
1350047 it isnt a contract until its signed by the parties and that wont happen for a couple of days
1350048 that was probably one of the best games in a long time
1350049 weve got to ask ourselves how bad we want to win
1350050 i got a great pass from gino and i just tried to put it upstairs and it went in
1350051 nothing had been going right for me this series so it was nice to get a winner like that
1350052 hes the reason why were still alive and im smiling right now
1350053 you win as a team and lose as a team and i just tried to do my job
1350054 it says a lot about the guys in the room
1350055 there was a power play and the game was on the line and he comes back the guys on the bench got pumped up when he stepped onto the ice i knew something special was going to happen and it did
1350056 people talk about their experience and our youth but we showed a lot of composure and when the game was on the line we got it done
1350057 yes were happy but now its on to game 6
1350058 its not the end of the road for us because we lost this game
1350059 theres two games left we get another chance on wednesday
1350060 but datsyuks disallowed goal looked in to me right under the cross bar
1350061 ou can really only complain about bad penalties if the team got scored on
1350062 we know as a team that we havent won anything yet
1350063 but sure youre excited to be in a position like this
1350064 this is where you want to be to have a chance to win the stanley cup
1350065 its a cliche but we have to take it one game and time and well see
1350066 we didnt execute well we had a chance to tie the game and we didnt do the job
1350067 so was pavel datsyuk on that 5 on 3 and kronwall and lidstrom
1350068 in those situations the pressure of the playoffs and the situation helps the penalty kill if thats november its tic tac toe and its in your net so fast but the pressure makes it harder for them to execute
1350069 we have to win one to get back so thats the way were thinking
1350070 i dont think theyre running away with it so well battle them in detroit and see what happens
1350071 hes not coming until too late for the warm up obviously he was stiffer and sorer than we thought
1350072 i thought osgood made some key saves and he got the rebounds too
1350073 on the 5 on 3 i thought he made two to three huge saves for us its tough when youre down a couple of players but he did a tremendous job for us and really carried the game for us
1350074 the first thing i thought was i cant believe that just happened
1350075 not only the player but the person was starting to emerge as a professional athlete
1350076 you could sense when you got to know luc that when he emerged as an nhl regular he would be an impact player he was a passionate individual that cared a great deal about his teammates and cared a great deal about his profession
1350077 its a great kid who loved life and was trying to get the most out of it
1350078 he was a very fun loving person he did what ever he wanted what ever made him happy in practice he worked hard but he always kept it light at the end of practice he would do some crazy games or drills
1350079 great kid great promising career my heart goes out to his family
1350080 he was a good kid he was a real funny kid he was a little bit shy because of language difficulties but he was a great player and he was going to be a big part of the canucks future
1350081 the reaction when you have events like this occur is obviously shock and sadness for a promising career that was just about to begin in the national hockey league
1350082 the first couple of years with us he felt a lot of the pressure of being a high pick and i think some of that was difficult for him
1350083 i think last year he started to shake that and was enjoying being a pro
1350084 he persevered through a lot he was a great guy and a great teammate
1350085 he was such a great young man with such a tremendous future ahead of him
1350086 when ever you lose someone at such a young age its a tragic situation
1350087 he blew the coaches away with his poise and strength
1350088 not too often do you see players that age especially in that position come in and look so at ease
1350089 we were so proud of luc when he scored the goal that tied up the canada us game which then lead to the infamous shoot out that brought the team to the final game against russia
1350090 luc bourdon will remain in our hearts and memories forever
1350091 i think that training camp created a level of expectations
1350092 i really felt this year he was starting to settle into kind of worrying about only what was in his control
1350093 he was trying to simplify his game and not worry about if he was in manitoba or vancouver just enjoy the sport and not the business side of it
1350094 at the end of the year he wanted to get home quickly because he had a close friend that was bedridden with cancer and it was important that he got home in time
1350095 moving forward we are most definitely going to have policies or educational programs not only for events like riding a motorcycle but anything that may impact or affect a career
1350096 there has definitely been an increase in the volume of harassment and now weve seen an increase in the stakes of the violence that theyre willing to spread in the name of this cause
1350097 ive played some good games in my career and i feel pretty good about myself right now
1350098 this is the time of year a team gets some unexpected goals and thats the sign of a good team
1350099 i felt a little bit better than i expected so its good to be back in again i really missed it its a lot of fun
1350100 i usually take a nap but i didnt get any sleep
1350101 i was excited my first final a lot of adrenaline going a lot of fun im just thrilled to be playing
1350102 sometimes we get lulled into just standing around a bit and they play well positionally
1350103 when were not at our best were just kind of playing a chess match with them
1350104 its a game of mistakes then if we dont capitalize and they do then were in trouble
1350105 the minute the buzzer goes its out of my head
1350106 osgood knows hes not going to get a ton of rubber but the rubber he does get hes got to be there for
1350107 we try go short and hard and play at a high tempo
1350108 were going to have a real good game in pittsburgh were excited to get on the road

1350117 the key factors for re growth in the country are of course first is re resources then re policy support attractive tariffs tight local supply and isolated grids which should push us to really become self sufficient

1350123 we have been struggling in this country day and night just to earn a living but it seems nothing could be achieved here weve spent thousands of dalasis just to enter

1350126 was one of the shorter stories in the book i didnt quite enjoy the somewhat stalkerish viewpoint of the narrator his obsession for the woman sitting next to him took on a whole new dimension that i couldnt quite understand
1350127 wherein a woman finds herself accidentally committed to a mental institution it was beautifully written yet terrifying leaving me with a pit in my stomach it was the ultimate nightmare scenario that was almost too real to read

1350135 what is surprising is that he has this column on the washington post and makes frequent appearances on meet the press
1350136 and what i have to wonder is broders economic value to the post
1350137 rather than supporting gen petraeus they are threatening to strip him of the troops he says he needs and sabotage his strategy
1350138 look the general i put in charge because he was willing to defend my policy publicly is defending my policy
1350139 now in these dread latter days of the old violent beloved u s a and of the christ forgetting christ haunted death dealing western world i came to myself in a grove of young pines and the question came to me has it happened at last
1350140 this is something weve seen for months now and it really rankles
1350141 fight them there so we dont have to fight them here
1350142 develop a strategy and a set of tactics to implement this policy
1350143 president may approve the strategy that they generals create but thats about it
1350144 when the power elite rolls out pure bullshit its actually a way of signalling how powerful they are
1350145 did you see what the ny times discovered about weapons of mass destruction
1350146 liebermans analysis is just another manifestation of his israel uber alles world view nothing more nothing less
1350147 we asked some soldiers and they are completely ok with the policies of the president
1350148 well its not the troops job to question the mission given to them that is our job
1350149 hey this war plan sucks youve been fighting iraq longer than wwii and not only have we failed to win but things are actually getting worse every day

1350151 dang i go to sleep when it is 30 13 phx over the lakers and i figure that series is over wake up and kobe scored 45 and the lakers won hmmmm damned time zones what happened there
1350152 having been a senator during 9 11 i understand the extraordinary horror of that kind of attack
1350153 i think a president must move as swiftly as is prudent to retaliate that doesnt mean we go looking for other fights lets focus on those who have attacked us and do everything we can to destroy them
1350154 we know without a doubt that al qaeda is responsible
1350155 well its rather a low bar to set but id catch osama bin laden before i went off an invaded a country that didnt have ties to terror or weapons of mass destruction
1350156 i would not read a childrens book for 7 minutes
1350157 when and how did kucinich get such a hot wife
1350158 id go from a posture of not killing certain heretofore unidentified bad guys and shift rapidly to a posture of killing those bad guys
1350159 id declare martial law and call out the troops to prevent a third or fourth city from going down
1350160 id stand down the nice guy brigades and deploy the special delta kappa whup ass devil forces
1350161 id ask my intelligence services to find out who did it and then while they were working on that id turn iran into a parking lot
1350162 id arrest all the liberals and put them in detention camps and then id execute them
1350163 i would bring back the rack convert the muslims to christianity and then send them all to jesus
1350164 oh no i know that i was only suggesting this is how republicans and other voters would think
1350165 if we are attacked and we can determine who was behind that attack and if there were nations that supported or gave material aid to those who attacked us i believe we should quickly respond
1350166 well the first thing id do would be to put down the copy of the pet goat
1350167 which two cities and would kitty dukakis be in one of them
1350168 i dont think it is at all obvious that dallas will win the series gs has a legitimate shot at pulling off the upset

1350174 the spurs have a lot of practice winning 4 of seven games that are like that
1350175 i understand your enthusiasm for the nuggets but they are the underdogs in the series san antonio is clearly favored by the statistically literate and illiterate
1350176 dunno perhaps other people arent as interested as you are in shows about bricklaying 9 25 natch
1350177 duncan is 31 yesterday but will continue to abuse their much quicker big men just as he has done his entire career that is why he is really good
1350178 i remember a coach once saying he preferred tall guys to short fast guys because at the end of the game the tall guys are still tall but the short fast guys are tired and slower
1350179 gs dallas was decided by the refs in the third dallas did not play any better than golden state
1350180 until davis and jackson were ejected davis for felony sarcasm it was a close one
1350181 baron davis was tossed with 0 2 seconds left in the third quarter and stephen jackson was lost with 4 34 left in the game golden state already was trailing when the technical fouls started piling up
1350182 the game was turning into a rout when jackson got his second technical
1350183 you crack me up al yeah you can say that you can say whatever you want
1350184 i missed the airtime of bill moyers widely discussed inquiry into the media and the iraq war
1350185 99 8 of the bloggers never do any original reporting
1350186 and you cant point to anything objective that changed your stance
1350187 it was supported by the democrats and infact was just the fullfillment of stated democrat policy

1350189 lets not wait until the smoking gun is a mushroom cloud
1350190 i think this misses the point that in the intervening period he was paid to produce a movie by an iraqi who it turns out got his money via the oil for food program
1350191 this active passionate life on the verge of the tropics is perfect material for the hemingway style and the reader carries away from the book a sense of freshness and exhilaration trade winds southern cities and warm seas all admirably described by the instrument of precision with which he writes

1350196 they had more energy and they controlled more plays i thought they did a pretty good job
1350197 you have to give them credit they found a way to win a game
1350198 i didnt think we used our bench good enough tonight
1350199 we didnt have the same kind of tempo that we had coming off our bench the first couple of games
1350200 it wasnt that the chances werent there its just that finally one went in for us we had hit posts and didnt get the bounces finally one went in and it felt good to get the first one
1350201 hes got such quick hands he just snapped it through me to be honest hes been good every game just because he gets no points it doesnt mean hes not doing a lot of good things out there he does everything weve been fortunate to contain him as much as we have

1350215 in themselves limits on offshore drilling are only a modest sized issue
1350216 its true that scientists dont know exactly how much world temperatures will rise if we persist with business as usual but that uncertainty is actually what makes action so urgent while theres a chance that well act against global warming only to find that the danger was overstated theres also a chance that well fail to act only to find that the results of inaction were catastrophic which risk would you rather run
1350217 there are a dizzying number of economic and national security arguments for drilling at home a 700 billion oil balance of payments deficit a gas tax equivalent levied on the paychecks of american workers and poured into the treasuries of enemy and terror supporting regimes growing dependence on unstable states of the persian gulf and caspian basin
1350218 they seem blissfully unaware that the argument for their drill there not here policy collapses on its own environmental terms

1350222 why should the german be interested in the liberation of the jew if the jew is not interested in the liberation of the german we recognize in judaism therefore a general anti social element of the present time in the final analysis the emancipation of the jews is the emancipation of mankind from judaism indeed in north america the practical domination of judaism over the christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the gospel itself and the christian ministry have become articles of trade money is the jealous god of israel in face of which no other god may exist

1350254 we pride ourselves in being a good forechecking team putting pressure on the defence to turn pucks over
1350255 our blueprint is to be aggressive and be smart force them to make a play maybe they dont want to make
1350256 fleury kept them in it early as ozzie did for us
1350257 we just happened to get the first goal and then the second goal huge goals by samuelsson
1350258 i dont know if it was the nerves but definitely that was the worst performance of the playoffs
1350259 we didnt compete like we were supposed to compete its a good lesson
1350260 you always want to get off to a good start at home
1350261 maybe we put a little too much pressure on ourself at first but once we skated well and executed we were a better hockey club and played well
1350262 i thought we were tough on their d in the last two periods
1350263 defence is tough to play when guys are hitting you nonstop for 40 straight minutes and thats what we accomplished thats why we ended up getting the goals that we did
1350264 hes being playing good all playoffs and he kept us in this game
1350265 we have to play a little better defence for him
1350266 i dont expect it to be easy and skate around there freely thats hockey i expect that and thats part of the game
1350267 dommen anf gter ikke at den danske udl ndingepolitik ligger fast men den p virker et hj rne af politikken
1350268 det er godt rigtigt og fornuftigt at have en domstol der vogter over at f llesregler overholdes i alle lande og s rligt som et mindre land har vi fra dansk side en interesse i at have en st rk domstol
1350269 det er vigtigt ikke at overdramatisere situationen der er afsagt en dom som danmark er uenig i men det er sket f r og det er hver gang lykkedes at finde en fornuftig l sning
1350270 jeg skal ikke g re mig klog p om den gr dis der trods alt d kker himlen det meste af dagen er smog eller sol dis men der er helt klart sket noget i den rigtige retning jeg var herude for et r siden og da var luften gul og ul kker

1350272 with a little more luck i might have been able to ask you to be my vice president
1350273 obama is a tad cooler than mccain on probably 57 fronts
1350274 obamas better looking than mccain obamas more stylish than mccain obamas more fit than mccain he refers to better music than mccain
1350275 mccain that guys not cool i just cant call mccain cool
1350276 hes younger i think he has more of a connection with my generation i just think he communicates better to my generation especially with issues in iraq mccain is all right but not as cool as obama
1350277 what obamas been able to do is capitalize on his hipness at least as far as younger voters go
1350278 i think its not that they dont support his issues and his policies but younger voters are more willing to work for him and work passionately for him because hes someone who resonates more on their wavelength
1350279 look at hugh hefner hell be cool til the day he dies but for him and for ron paul or anybody whos elderly and whos cool part of it is what they represent that makes them that
1350280 the most important thing in terms of reaching youth is not being cool its being authentic or true to who you are
1350281 i think hed look ridiculous if he tried to purposefully seem younger than he is if he started doing extreme sports or something ridiculous
1350282 has a very conservative image and that doesnt really help him either
1350283 shes not the type like obamas wife who can get down and dirty with younger people and really relate to them
1350284 its not a popularity contest hes running for leader of the free world
1350285 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1350286 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1350287 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved
1350288 as mark would suggest the book teaches readers the following

1350295 thats fucking hilarious and rodman to his benefit can say he wasnt within 1000 miles of being sober at that precise moment whats bushs excuse
1350296 well have you mountain biking to powells hiking to the top of mt adams and kiting in the hood in no time
1350297 which brings me to the fact that im pretty sure im prepared to defend the claim that the 48 states should adopt a single time zone
1350298 yoo hoo tom over here largest state in the nation 20 of all electoral votes needed to get a candidate elected it is prime time you jackass
1350299 im pretty sure im prepared to defend the claim that the 48 states should adopt a single time zone
1350300 whats telling however is whats absent obama doesnt say he opposed the war because of a nagging skepticism towards husseins wmd capabilities nor because this administration wasnt competent enough to pull such a conflict off rather he opposed it because it was the wrong war focused on the wrong threats and stemming from the wrong ideology
1350301 allow me to try and beat the pro edwards commentariat to the punch antisemite
1350302 does obama really think we need to increase the size of the army and marines or is he just saying that for political reasons
1350303 im curious if your views on ben gordon have changed at all over the past few months looking back at his season
1350304 really have edwards and hillary already come out for an increase in the size of the military
1350305 to be frank im not seeing much of a foreign policy here at all just a lot of broad strokes that allow sympathetic listeners to fill in the blanks
1350306 its good to see that you are not letting that stop you from making strong pronouncements about
1350307 first of all another cop out by obama edwards decision to go with more detailed plans sooner is making obama look like hes not ready to lead he doesnt yet know what he really believes or how far hes willing to go fighting for it
1350308 id like this proposal better if it came with a promise to do away with the missile defense program a useless incredibly expensive boondoggle if there ever was one
1350309 as weve seen in iraq an absence of logistical capabilities wont stop a bad president from launching an unwise invasion
1350310 cut boondoggle x and then ill go along with your bigger army idea
1350311 many times its for positive reasons and to help help with disasters in the world like tsunamis ect
1350312 its almost like you guys dont believe there really are bad guys out there assumedly because bush has so badly misguided our efforts to date against them
1350313 killing civilians means you dont get to tell me about your percieved grievances
1350314 i dont really know where to take this discussion from here
1350315 you then go on for four more points all of which are reasons you hate bush cheney making you 0 5 in relating any of this to obamas proposed troop levels for a 21st century army

1350323 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
1350324 say whatever you want about bill clinton but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based
1350325 we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united states of their own party
1350326 i think the mccain camp watched our primary on the democratic side very carefully and they know that any accusation of racial divisiveness can be very very harmful for a candidates prospects

1350352 whilst spouses may have the skills experience or qualifications to make them the most appropriate candidate for work in their partners parliamentary or constituency office this is less likely to apply to mps children whether under 18 or young adults
1350353 furthermore recent incidents involving the employment by mps of their children demonstrate clearly the negative impact this has on public confidence in members
1350354 the proposal is therefore that mps children should no longer be able to gain paid employment in their parents constituency or parliamentary offices or in any other role relating to the parents work as an mp

1350356 its a long cherished dream to work with salman khan said ashutosh gowarikar on the sidelines of the world kids international film festival held in the capital recently but the perfectionist director has nothing concrete to offer the peter pan actor right away as soon as i find a script which suits his image i will approach him
1350357 i am trying to do something different in the film which is a romantic comedy
1350358 i signed harman because he totally suits the character in
1350359 she is a good actor but i think she has lot more to offer i am trying to bring something special out of her in my next venture
1350360 this film is a challenge for me as it is very difficult to make a comedy but i like to face new challenges
1350361 i am a big fan of hrishida and basuda i love to watch jyoti swaroop directed padosan again and again thats my favourite comedy film
1350362 i dont think youre ever going to convince voters that the democrats are the authentic party of militaristic nationalism
1350363 the more i think about this idea the less i like it the budgetary costs involved are staggering and the strategic rationale is thin
1350364 i didnt think it was possible that edwards having outflanked obama to the left on almost every issue could do it with foreign policy now i think he could maybe
1350365 to move the country to the left not to get all obama y on you but how about forwards
1350366 i dont think there are really that many members of the one true left not enough to get an election on that basis alone anyway
1350367 why he would be more likely to get universal healthcare and higher minimum wages passed than obama or clinton
1350368 petey can be a little annoying hes also usually correct
1350369 but i voted for bloomberg and all that surely i cant be much of a lefty
1350370 but then what do we do with all these underpants
1350371 for instance the future battlefields initiative so why are we spending that money i would say it is because military keynesianism has become entrenched in our system
1350372 if you dont accept the uss role as outlined above then stuff like future battlefields doesnt make sense but i dont think military keynesianism is the correct rationale under current strategic thinking
1350373 the cost of being the hyperpower is actually quite cheap
1350374 if however too large a proportion of the states resources is diverted from wealth creation and allocated instead to military purposes then that is likely to lead to a weakening of national power over the longer term in the same way if a state overextends itself strategically by say the conquest of extensive territories or the waging of costly wars it runs the risk that the potential benefits from external expansion may be outweighed by the great expense of it all a dilemma which becomes acute if the nation concerned has entered a period of relative economic decline
1350375 in the largest sense of all therefore the only answer to the question increasingly debated by the public of whether the united states can preserve its existing position is
1350376 petey of course it isnt quite cheap it is only cheap by making the military budget refer not to our military needs but to some weird percentage of the gnp
1350377 instead the anti hyperpower position only gets presented by cranks who think the us strategic position is determined by military keynesianism or who think that the us strategic position is financially unsustainable and thats not even beginning to take into account the mega crankiness of the pure pacifist believers and the anlgo canadian clueless
1350378 the power vacuum that will result will just be awful china will get all powerful the middle east will get unstable and africa will once again be poor it is a world in ruins we are talking about

1350403 oh no if youre in melbourne you should have had them by last friday at the latest
1350404 i spent a lot of my life in hotels travelling from one hotel to the next playing hockey
1350405 its not suitable for everybody my current job is to negotiate contracts with our tour operators from all over the world
1350406 i remember at the age of six years old and seven years old i played with kids that were 12 or 13 years old
1350407 when you play with kids bigger than you you learn pretty fast
1350408 i remember when i played there johnny bower used to come down and teach us how to play
1350409 but the expectations for me were above anything id ever experienced
1350410 i still receive probably 10 to 15 letters a month asking me to autograph bubble gum cards
1350411 it has been a long time but its something i never thought wouldnt happen in my career
1350412 thats probably the best ive felt in this building ever your next game is always supposed to be your best and for whatever reason it just felt i was in total control it usually works out like that when you have that feeling
1350413 there werent as many quality close chances as there has been
1350414 were excited to go back home and to continue to push this thing along
1350415 i saw it before the game even started the focus he had
1350416 once the game started he was real comfortable back there playing pucks reading plays making passes
1350417 hes giving us a chance to win every night unfortunately its a team sport and we havent been there for him sometimes and hes going to get the brunt of the blame were all in it together and saturday we pulled through
1350418 i think we can do a better job in the neutral zone were backing up and giving them too much room
1350419 theres been a lot documented about his struggles up here
1350420 i dont look at it as his struggles as much as our teams struggles
1350421 but for us to be successful he has to be very good and thats what you saw from him today there was so much battle in him one of our teams themes this year has been finding a will to win and i think marty exemplified that he wasnt going to be denied in this game and he made enough saves for us to get the win
1350422 every time hes been backed up against the wall hes responded
1350423 were not going to wear these shirts or these hats
1350424 i think coming in here i was just so focused on trying to have a good first year let alone going to the cup final this quickly with the amount of youth weve had now you look at the second half of my first year a lot of our first years and it was pretty difficult
1350425 but weve come a long way and weve worked hard for it and earned it and this is a great opportunity for us all
1350426 you dont see too many guys touch it a couple of the guys who have been through it before they all gave me a heads up for sure and its a good feeling to go up there
1350427 but we all realized thats not the one we want to be holding
1350428 the way this team is going im not surprised and as long as we keep playing our hockey i think well be good
1350429 you always approach the playoffs with a lot of confidence
1350430 and the confidence that we had is the way that weve been finishing the year the last two months i thought we played some great hockey not only offensively but defensively as well
1350431 weve made tremendous strides this year and weve come an awful long way
1350432 i thought today we set the tone right from the start we were really sharp offensively we concentrate well defensively when there were a few breakdowns fleury was outstanding
1350433 it was early in my career and i thought i might have paid too much for it
1350434 i should know im with the devils we played lundqvists new york rangers 14 times this year and beat them once
1350435 i never understood that goldstein said those are areas that are going to go republican but its not like the electoral college every african american voter you bring out in the panhandle offsets a cuban voter in miami likely to vote republican

1350438 i think they have great continuity and i think theyre well coached
1350439 i think mr slava bykov has done a great job he has made them accountable and you can see that on the ice you can see their team plays with character they have a great team
1350440 lots of times with the national team we were down two zip in different tournaments everyone would say thats it
1350441 but then we just talked in the locker room and we said weve got nothing to lose
1350442 i thought maybe we were trying to protect the lead a little too much our game is to forecheck hard and be on their d and work the puck in their end hard two goal lead going into the third i thought we had played pretty well up to then we gave them too much room in the third period and they have some really good shooters over there
1350443 i dont think you can do that now because those guys are nhl experienced guys now
1350444 youre not going to push those guys out of the game we could get hold of them before they experienced stuff like this we pushed fedorov and alexander mogilny out of the game in the world juniors in 1988 but you cant do that anymore ovechkin and semin have been pounded on for 82 games plus playoffs and theyve responded no problem
1350445 it doesnt matter what kind of player you are when you have guys in your face its hard to play the game i think what we cant do is let them create time and space where they can make plays and shoot the puck if we can eliminate those two things we should be fine with their line

1350454 were in quebec why would it be surprising that i am here
1350455 weve got good players on the horizon and we all know the olympics are the measuring stick
1350456 if youre talking about world power and youre talking about supremacy in hockey you talk about the olympics theyre missing players for this tournament theres a player playing in detroit pavel datsyuk whos not bad and were missing players in this tournament when you get it together at the olympics and everybody is there thats the measuring stick we all know that

1350459 we may think that red sox fans are a different breed cut from better cloth than the average baseball fan
1350460 today i discovered that there is a type of poem called a
1350461 it was just a solid first period and obviously the difference in the hockey game were back in the stanley cup and it sounds great for us
1350462 we were close last year and as disappointing as last year was it was a great learning experience for everyone young and old on this team
1350463 i think its a big reason why were going back this year
1350464 i thought it was a combination of us hoping to win and detroit pushing the issue to win
1350465 i think they had a real hard focus around our net
1350466 that was something that i wanted one of my goals among others
1350467 we came a long way this year but this wasnt our ultimate goal
1350468 we did make some progress we put a lot of work into this and want to do it again this will make us hungrier
1350469 it went off my chin it went in who cares
1350470 it really hurts to think of what we could have done
1350471 its the ultimate disappointment of letting the guys down it comes with the territory you handle it and deal with it
1350472 bring the cup back to canada because its our game and nobody elses especially the soft europeans and frigid russians and easily pleased swedes and largely disinterested americans
1350473 no team with a european captain will ever win the cup
1350474 im more canadian than don cherry there should be no non canadians in hockey etc etc
1350475 canadians shouldnt claim hockey as theirs because that would make them like the usamericans then please note a stereotype about how americans always equals bad
1350476 la guerra de las galaxias la guerra de los clones
1350477 empezamos a trabajar para la serie y desarrollamos nueva tecnolog a nuevas t cnicas un nuevo estilo y cuando la vi me dije
1350478 i was coming to support him and i felt like i was discriminated against by the very person who was supposed to be bringing this change who i could really relate to
1350479 the message that i thought was delivered to us was that they do not want him associated with muslims or muslim supporters
1350480 explained to me that because of the political climate and whats going on in the world and whats going on with muslim americans its not good for aref to be seen on tv or associated with obama
1350481 were not letting anyone with anything on their heads like baseball caps or scarves sit behind the stage
1350482 the scarf is not just something she can take off its part of her identity
1350483 let down that the obama campaign continuously perpetuates this attitude towards muslims and arabs as if being merely associated with one is a sin
1350484 he was the one candidate who you would expect to stand up for something like that and behind the scenes you have something completely contrary to what he was running on
1350485 i think this is a much bigger deal than maybe theyre perceiving it as
1350486 if they are true to their word i think it would suffice to have an invitation to their next rally and have seats behind him and show up on tv
1350487 this is of course not the policy of the campaign it is offensive and counter to obamas commitment to bring americans together and simply not the kind of campaign we run we sincerely apologize for the behavior of these volunteers
1350488 indeed you will follow the practices of those who came before you handspan by handspan armspan by armspan to the point that if they follow the lizard into its hole you would follow them in this
1350489 o messenger of allah are you referring to the jews and christians
1350490 this nation i e the muslims will not leave anything from the practices of the people who came before it except that it will adopt them
1350491 you will follow ways of those who came before you step by step you will not avoid their path and it will not avoid you
1350492 there is nothing that bani israil did except that you will do the same
1350493 by allah you resemble bani israil more than anyone else you will not leave a single thing that they did except that you will also do it and there will not be a single characteristic that they had except that you will also have it
1350494 you resemble bani israil more than anyone else in their character and practice you imitate them in their actions step by step except that i am not sure whether or not you will worship a calf
1350495 there isnt anything that was with bani israil except that it will also be with you
1350496 by allah there is nothing about those who came before you except that it will also be with you
1350497 you will adopt the practices of those who came before you the good and the bad
1350498 so we entered the mosque and we saw the people praying
1350499 praise be to allah who has caused islam to unite white and black people
1350500 by the one in whose hand my soul is the day of resurrection will not come until you adopt some practices of every religion
1350501 they will pray like you pray they will sit in your gatherings they will live amongst you and they will adopt some of the practices of every religion
1350502 these mawquf narrations from the companions have the ruling of being marfu attributed to the prophet since they discuss issues of the unseen and the companions would not speak about such issues from their own opinion rather they took these words from the prophet and allah knows best
1350503 i didnt care if they lost just that they played hard
1350504 christmas we need to keep the offensive preasure on and neutralzone locked down to keep pucks away from fluery
1350505 3 of the top 10 elite players in the world
1350506 crosby s been three years in the league and won a hart trophy last season and when you look at him he is turning 21 this year it is really amazing what he has accomplished so far for only being in the league for a short period of time but he is one of the superstars in our league right now we are going to have to take his time and space away be close to him dont give him the ice to skate on and find the open lanes with his passing he is still going to find some open space because he is such a good player if you have him matched up against zetterbergs line and make them play some defense and that is an area i think we can do good at him as well you just try to be close to him at all times that is one of keys you have to do against him
1350507 get real the wings have this thing wrapped up we have more experience blah blah blah crosby sucks refs baby him etc etc
1350508 crosby and malkin havent faced a real defensive force yet
1350509 this will be the first real opponent for pittsburgh wings will be giving them fits and then the excuses will pour out pittsburgh is only little girls with the sorry loser mentality easy points in a easy division in a easy conference its time to pay the piper wings in 6 or less
1350510 the hand who rocks the cradle may rock the world
1350511 i havent heard anything about an upcoming wedding from lindsay but if she was marrying sam i dont think shed ask me to walk her down the aisle she knows about my christian faith she just wouldnt ask
1350512 i had dinner on the beach with a crush and there were lights on the palm trees then went walking on the beach and after that we slow danced wait it gets better while we were slow dancing my crush and i had our first kiss and after it i leaned back and i said you cheated and he said why and i said i dont kiss on the first date then he said well i never really play by the rules i was waiting for a a director to say cut i was like are we shooting this right now
1350513 on one date the girl said to me i dont kiss on the first date
1350514 everywhere i go no matter what the women in the audience their first question for me is how on earth are you managing it how are you keeping it all together
1350515 im fine because i have a strong informal support network
1350516 i have a mother who lives five minutes from me i dont know what i would do even if we werent running i dont know what i would do as a professional without having that kind of support system so that keeps me sane
1350517 i know were spending i added it up for the first time we spend between the two kids on extracurriculars outside the classroom were spending about 10 000 a year on piano and dance and sports supplements and so on and so forth
1350518 we dont complain because weve got resources because of our education weve got family structure
1350519 the salaries dont keep up with the cost of paying off the debt so youre in your 40s still paying off your debt at a time when you have to save for your kids
1350520 the only reason were not in that position is that barack wrote two best selling books it was like jack and his magic beans but up until a few years ago we were struggling to figure out how we would save for our kids
1350521 we left corporate america which is a lot of what were asking young people to do
1350522 dont go into corporate america you know become teachers work for the community be social workers be a nurse those are the careers that we need and were encouraging our young people to do that but if you make that choice as we did to move out of the money making industry into the helping industry then your salaries respond
1350523 many of our bright stars are going into corporate law or hedge fund management
1350524 but i recognize that sound its the sound of freedom

1350533 it sounds good to tom so its ok with me
1350534 you cant hold a vote no matter how unofficial and then decide to ignore the results
1350535 i think that it would depend on the circumstances the amount of the structured settlement and the company that i was working with
1350536 if something seems too good to be true then it usually is after all these people are in the business of selling things before anything else
1350537 its me megan well meg you know the redneck from oklahoma sleepy new mommy

1350564 as a fan youve just got to love watching those guys
1350565 its not too often you see three guys that big that talented and that skilled together and they tend to make it happen
1350566 if you give up a 3 on 2 against the russians its going to be a great scoring opportunity we have to check as well as we have ever checked in our lives but were capable of doing it
1350567 what i like about the community is you can just be yourself there are a lot of wealthy people here but you would never know it the people are genuine and look out for each other and thats what the rangers try to do for the community
1350568 we recognize were going to have to answer to the season ticket holders at the annual meeting we cant just turn left without considering what wouldve been if we turned right its like making decisions for a major company it affects a lot of people so you cant just do something without thinking of everyone
1350569 i have a passion for the sport and the team
1350570 and at the same time i could work in town
1350571 where we made mistakes was not fixing the hockey side fast enough we probably focused too much on the financial but we sort of had to
1350572 coming here as a player and being part of that 1981 team and then staying in the community going to school and coming back as a volunteer in 1995 winning the memorial cup and then doing the tournament bid its very gratifying
1350573 i dont know how or if i will be involved
1350574 but i do believe canada should have another nhl team
1350575 canada is the home of hockey the birthplace of hockey and the soul of hockey
1350576 and i think canada should have another pro hockey team wherever they should have one or two more
1350577 i could afford to pay for it yeah i could afford to sure you could build a building of course
1350578 canada is a prosperous country and people love hockey and you would fill the building in a day
1350579 i believe youll see some interesting names next season in our league from the nhl
1350580 if they give one to hamilton toronto will want one too
1350581 l j p 2008 05 16 01 16 44 et why does everyone insist on going to winnipeg they just built a rink 5 years ago that is too small for the nhl
1350582 the guy had his head down it was his fault its hockey if we are going to whine after every bodycheck wed be better off doing figure skating
1350583 i dont see why we would change it up right now
1350584 i didnt even know how many games there were in the tournament when i started cam ward i started ward in the first exhibition game and we just continued to alternate
1350585 my name is out there and people can contact me whenever they want
1350586 guys like myself and gabby boudreau who have paid their dues in the minors and rode the buses eventually if you win in those leagues you deserve an opportunity
1350587 i play every game like its going to be my last
1350588 i know we still have two games but i found thats good for me i feel good but ive always said this is a young mans game when i came back this year i was very happy but now ive been on the road three weeks and it feels like a long time
1350589 ive always said ill play as long as i feel i can play and as long as i like coming to the rink and so far it looks good
1350590 not a chance not a chance no you never know
1350591 its a david and goliath type of story again the same as it was last year
1350592 its almost got to be the perfect game to beat them theyre so big theyre so skilled they skate well they do everything so well
1350593 we have to be in their space a little bit
1350594 they dont like to be bothered they like an easy game all the time because theyre so skilled at the same time if you get into penalty trouble you might as well just pack your bags
1350595 with the qualities our players have the stickhandling good skating good vision of the ice speed and discipline we hope to have a game plan that will allow us to get through the defense its not easy thats clear its hard to play against a team that defends very well
1350596 they can create so much offensively by playing a physical game
1350597 theyre the best team ive seen without the puck they give you nothing easy they look like theyve played together for years they can break you down and thats how theyve gotten to where they are now
1350598 we watched the video and the player kovalchuk did not lift his arm however maybe he did take a few extra steps
1350599 but we are not out there to hurt people by no means is there any intention to hurt
1350600 hard and clean by one of our players and he reacted to that
1350601 julien was walking around but he was in a lot of pain
1350602 and we have some internal injuries to look at hes getting an mri right now
1350603 it must be one team of players who are all there to play for each other not for themselves
1350604 we have all the talent in the world but so does everybody else
1350605 right now it comes down to who is willing to pay attention to the details
1350606 ron helped foster a new era in san jose sharks hockey with some record setting regular season performances
1350607 however ultimately we have decided that it is time for a different voice and a different approach to lead this team
1350608 we are proud of what weve accomplished as an organization but we feel that this team is capable of achieving greater success
1350609 you look at my record its second to none literally in the sport so im not even worried about that
1350610 i dont think there has to be too many things changed about our team were ready to roll next year too weve accomplished more since ive been here than any other team in the league except win the stanley cup thats the next thing we check off on our list
1350611 we are more known for our offensive attack and the star players we have but especially since the start of the playoffs the players are really committed defensively
1350612 weve really improved in that area since the start of the season and we showed it again tonight
1350613 the next game will be the most difficult we need to dial it up a notch
1350614 everyone talks about their offence but theyre really committed defensively
1350615 theyre on a roll were getting outplayed right now and we have to dig in
1350616 we tried to keep it as simple as possible its all five guys out there being on the same page
1350617 everyone has done a good job of buying in and thats why were in the position were in today
1350618 the two quick goals took some pressure off and helped us relax a little
1350619 you play into their hands right now when you give them the lead
1350620 ah but the flyers will beat them up the penguins are a finesse team not a physical team

1350623 what do the global and domestic aids epidemics have in common
1350624 aids activists used direct action techniques traditional lobbying skills and just about every advocacy tactic under the sun to ensure that most states could piece together the funding resources to purchase highly active antiretroviral hart treatment for those who were unable to pay
1350625 which they easily could because there is a huge mark up as a result only 5 of people in the developing world who needed hiv treatment were receiving it in 2003
1350626 that people who have multiple sexual partners drive the spread of hiv in areas where hiv is widespread people may not have a large number of sex partners but they have more than one at the same time
1350627 once hiv enters one of these small networks the entire network is likely to become infected that makes having multiple concurrent partners more dangerous than serial monogamy
1350628 in the late 1990s public health workers hoped the female condom would overthrow the politics of the bedroom empower women and stop the
1350629 it is something associated with casual sex if a wife uses a condom the message is that you have been unfaithful if she even initiates the discussion it tips the power scale men resist quite a lot and it can result in violence
1350630 what we really need is our political leaders to stand up and tell the truth about what is happening
1350631 we need role models wholl tell us whether they themselves are hiv positive or not wholl say you must respect women you must use condoms its not happening at the moment
1350632 female condoms must be more widely available so women can take contraception into their own hands and not just rely on the man
1350633 only about 12 million female condoms are delivered each year in poor countries compared with about 6 billion male condoms

1350675 i am more than willing to share who i am and to open up my heart and soul to people so that they know that in addition to getting barack this tremendous mind and person to lead our country that the people behind him and beside him his wife and family that we all represent what is good and wonderful about america
1350676 barack and i as partners as friends and as lovers we accessorize each other in many ways
1350677 the best thing i love having on me is barack on my arm and vice versa whether its having him standing there smiling at me or watching him mesmerize a crowd or talk to some seniors in a senior center
1350678 dont vote for barack because you think hes cute or because you like his smile this can be a purely objective decision because the choices are pretty clear
1350679 supreme court appointments are on the table the fate and the direction of this country for the next four or eight years is on the table and i would just urge people to be informed about the issues and then decide
1350680 as far as bill is concerned the club has been for sale for the last five years this is nothing new
1350681 we do have a very strong team better financed and better resourced than ever and i believe this will deliver the goods and we will move significantly forward from 10th
1350682 we are confident we will move forward but it would be unwise to speculate how close we will get to fourth

1350684 there was a big problem in that adobe flash is unavailable to the masses the only way a mere mortal can do something really cool on a web site or in a presentation is to hire a flash programmer for a lot of money
1350685 they deliver the finished project to you in a form you can never edit or change youre tethered to that programmer we came to believe that that was really a big problem
1350686 with act there was a certain amount time the salesperson had to invest to get what they wanted out of it

1350692 it proceeds in the second sentence to say that notwithstanding the first sentence any public agency in colorado would be free to leave preferences intact
1350693 ban affirmative action programs designed to eliminate discrimination against and improve opportunities for women and minorities in public contracting employment and education
1350694 all the forces of the left are converging in missouri acorn and the rest of the race industry the feminists the unions the contractors who feed off this stuff and george soros is providing a lot of the funding theyre enlisting the whole vast left wing conspiracy and believe me its a lot vaster than the supposed right wing one
1350695 we had a choice of spending a quarter of a million dollars to defend the signatures we had with the likelihood of not succeeding

1350697 i dont blame the democrats for being scared of these initiatives

1350699 anne ik heb een test gedaan en ik vrees dat ik zwanger ben
1350700 if you think about this week what theyve been good at is distraction
1350701 youve got statistics saying we lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney
1350702 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks and planting doubts about people
1350703 we have to make sure that we keep focused on peoples day to day concerns and weve got to drive that very hard and i will keep on driving that hard
1350704 we dont take the skill of the republicans in engaging in negative attacks lightly
1350705 i would argue that issues like my relative youth or the fact that i have been on the national stage a relatively or you know not as long as somebody like john mccain has been those are issues that they are going to try to play up
1350706 hes famous but not necessarily well known so attacks on his character and identity can hurt
1350707 i think what would be useful is to ask the question whats this based on
1350708 obviously we think we are in a tight race and we think that this is going to be a close race all the way through
1350709 saying to themselves what does this have to do with me
1350710 they split their first two games in their first two playoff series
1350711 we didnt want to give them any life so were happy to get this win and hopefully well two in their building
1350712 my left eye is swollen shut right now i will keep the ice on it and get the swelling down and see what happens tomorrow
1350713 since video review of the play proved inconclusive as to if the puck crossed the goal line the call of no goal on the ice stands
1350714 max is a real communicator out there and thats one the reasons i passed the puck out in front to him because he yelled for it
1350715 you turn pucks over and give up rushes against crosby and malkin thats a game you cant play
1350716 every time you get an odd man rush error it favours them those are things we cant do
1350717 when we turn pucks over in the neutral zone they come with too much speed and they get you on the rush
1350718 that was a huge goal by malkin its the kind of goals that kill a team
1350719 at the last second i just decided to shoot that puck as hard as i can
1350720 i didnt think about where to shoot or to make any moves just shoot as hard as i can
1350721 one of the best hits was malkin on coburn and that shows just the character of the players
1350722 we know if we can put lots of pressure on our their d were going to get the puck back
1350723 we did that much better in the second and third periods
1350724 we know how theyre going to score their goals they throw a lot of pucks to the net and not playing in a week the competitiveness level wasnt there for us at the beginning
1350725 we have to view this that hes not a player for us in the series and march on
1350726 its the most disappointing thing in my hockey life for sure
1350727 how many times in your lifetime do you get to play in the conference finals or the stanley cup finals
1350728 obviously you cant replace a player that does what kimmo does for us
1350729 you wont see new spyborg assets for several more months
1350730 were refining it considerably pretty much as significant an overhaul as dark void underwent from its first announcement to its first big reveal
1350731 no matter how paranoid or conspiracy minded you are what the government is actually doing is worse than you imagine
1350732 weve got a group that wants to win bad and were determined
1350733 weve been here before and never got the job done
1350734 we got rested up and if anything you get eager to play again
1350735 we did a good job of getting pucks on marty making things difficult for him
1350736 its hard to play goal against our team because we shoot pucks from everywhere and we get guys in front of the goalie
1350737 we do have flashy players but tonight we scored by going to the net and getting guys in front of the goalie
1350738 thats a game that wasnt even close to the games we played in the playoffs
1350739 whatever the reason we didnt play close to our capability we just didnt skate didnt get to the level we needed to be at give the red wings all the credit in the world they did what they had to do to win were going to have to be much better
1350740 their legs will be back and the series will be on
1350741 theres no question that the next game theyll be back and rolling
1350742 it was surprising it came all the way back that far from the post
1350743 guys were scrambling around and i saw turco was down so i was trying to go high and it got in
1350744 we talked about it before the game that we wanted to get engaged right away
1350745 we wanted to get our feet going get skating right away we wanted to come out with a strong effort right away
1350746 he sees when a guy is vulnerable and hes got that ability to hunt you down
1350747 its important for us with him and brad stuart that theyre alway son the hunt because it makes opponents nervous youve got to be aware of where theyre at
1350748 but i dont want to think about that right now
1350749 my only concern now is to win seven more games this year
1350750 its not that were relying on one or two players
1350751 we have a lot of players chipping in and helping out
1350752 thats one of the keys to our success so far that were not relying on one line to carry the team its been balanced scoring strong team defence and i think this is very comparable to some of the teams we had back in the 90s
1350753 no harm done you get up and you go but something like the slash on osgood thats right out of slap shot ribeiro just literally intent to injure on our best player i couldnt believe it when he did it
1350754 theres a lot on the line and its physical but thats just crossing the line
1350755 the leagues been great all year about stepping in and taking care of this stuff if its not a goalie and he two hands it could hit a player in the throat face teeth whatever you kind of shake your head at what he was thinking its up to the league to step in and do what they have to do
1350756 i dont think it justifies a two hander over the top of the net
1350757 this is as good as we played as long as ive been here
1350758 weve got no doubt we can win some hockey games at home
1350759 were disappointed were down 2 0 but itll be a totally different atmosphere when we get home
1350760 they were going to come out hard and they did too
1350761 they had the puck a lot more in our end and created some chances
1350762 we were short handed four times in the second period but we played real well in our own end
1350763 we kept them to the outside and didnt give them chances in front of our net
1350764 if thats the case a butt end to somebodys face at any time is pretty gutless
1350765 i do have a lot of padding up there but it got me in the side where i didnt have much
1350766 it was kind of a full swing right to the side but ill be fine im sure a little sore but ill be fine
1350767 anybody else but me anybody else but me he was talking to the hypocrite and
1350768 i guess no one shared my insight about the destruction of the catholic shrines in the 16th century
1350769 no i am not suggesting that the archbishop of canterbury should resign and for the record it was the times of london that approached me about writing an essay on why the church of uganda bishops were not attending lambeth
1350770 it seems to me that the maturing of the global nature of the anglican communion beyond its colonial beginnings would involve separating the role of the spiritual leader of the communion from that of the primate of all england
1350771 however i do think its time to realise that the anglican communion is no longer an extension of the church of england
1350772 and may i just add that i agree with archbishop and others when he says that

1350777 these activities have been introduced in response to feedback received from young people and their parents and aims to improve the opportunities and lifestyles for young people
1350778 engaging in such positive activities will hopefully lead to less anti social behaviour across the borough and promote a sense of responsibility and citizenship within our communities
1350779 i would encourage as many young people as possible to take advantage of this exciting opportunity
1350780 as well as promoting health and wellbeing our activities offer young people an opportunity to network with one another improving self esteem discipline and respect
1350781 previous projects have resulted in uncovering unhidden talent and promoting community cohesion participation in our activities could lead to sports leader awards youth achievement awards and duke of edinburgh this is a fantastic offer and one not to be missed
1350782 the result of this prosecution should send a clear message to everyone that knowsley will not tolerate benefit cheats and those caught will be placed before the courts
1350783 we work closely with the dwp to share information about those suspected of fraud and to gather evidence for prosecutions
1350784 the reason we take such a hard line is because we realise that every pound which goes into a fraudsters pocket is a pound that could have been spent on schools sports centres parks and other facilities that benefit the whole community
1350785 i would encourage anyone who is claiming benefit and has a change of circumstances to declare this at the earliest opportunity
1350786 the sentence in this case clearly illustrates the serious nature of the offence and the consequences of committing benefit fraud
1350787 in addition the department will now seek full reimbursement of the money fraudulently obtained this is an excellent example of our success at tackling benefit fraud when we work closely with our colleagues at knowsley council
1350788 benefit fraud is a crime no ifs no buts benefit cheats take money intended for the most vulnerable in our society the public rightly get angry about such anti social behaviour and with their support our skilled investigators will track down the fraudsters
1350789 while the majority of licensees and parents are completely responsible there are some who are supply young people with alcohol this has to stop
1350790 as well as the legal consequences of drinking underage and the negative health effects on young people a particular area of concern is the vulnerability of young people when under the influence of alcohol
1350791 officers from our environmental health and consumer protection team will be carrying out test purchases across the borough throughout the coming months
1350792 this type of work has proved to be valuable deterrent and has also helped us root out a minority of irresponsible licensees who deliberately flout the law equally though we realise that businesses do need support from time to time and if anyone out there would like help and advice on complying with the law they can contact us
1350793 we have had tremendous success over the last few years and our continued action is reassuring local people that the safer knowsley partnership is serious about tackling the illegal drugs market and prosecuting offenders police have been able to put strong case files together and with the support of the crown prosecution service we have ensured that a substantial number of people have been brought to justice with the publics help we aim to build on these successes and put more offenders before the courts
1350794 drug activity is an issue which can and does affect individuals families and blights communities community information plays a huge part in our work it enables us to understand the scale of the problem target our resources and crack down on street level drug dealing and its working
1350795 we know that tough enforcement is important in challenging bad behaviour but we also know that should be followed with support to tackle the underlying problems our aim is to make sure that every young person has the very best start to life and by addressing the underlying causes of bad behaviour we can hope to increase education attainment
1350796 we are proposing a community sized solution for local waste that would otherwise fill up landfill sites and emit damaging greenhouse gases we offer a proven and world class low emission gasification technology that can help the uk build a much needed sustainable waste infrastructure
1350797 the scheme would create a similar renewable power output to 18 large wind turbines no more than 40 lorries would visit the site each day and they would have direct access from the east lancs road or m57 in addition the facility would be barely visible from residential communities
1350798 this targeted campaign has had a tremendous impact in the southdene area however the safer knowsley partnership will not be complacent and we are committed to reducing vehicle crime even further by following some simple tips you can make it harder for car thieves
1350799 lucidmedias clicksense technology will significantly help increase the prospective yield of a publishers available inventory and improve an advertisers ability to contextually target ads to relevant content and categories through the right media exchange
1350800 if the flyers take penalties the pens will dine out on them
1350801 ich bin mit dem rennverlauf ber die distanz gesehen ganz zufrieden denn ohne unsere fast einst ndige standzeit h tte das ergebnis ganz anders aussehen k nnen
1350802 ill come in there and plant some weed its a community garden right
1350803 i never thought of that kind of vandalism thats kind of subversive and brilliant
1350804 i think that guys having his own kind of day
1350805 thats what happens when you start your day with a breakfast of vodka
1350806 we are focused on offering people the best service with as many choices as possible and this venue offers an excellent alternative for people seeking something a little different on their special day
1350807 the gazebo is already proving a real success we have already had several weddings here a naming ceremony and a civil partnership
1350808 we are always looking for ways to improve the service we offer people and to make their day all the more special and we have certainly achieved that with the gazebo
1350809 i tried to get it on net it went off a stick fortunately it went in
1350810 he would have been real deep in my depth chart
1350811 he just got it over me and it hit my stick
1350812 it was another bad break its amazing how we cant get a bounce in this series
1350813 the referee cant see the puck because hes standing behind the net
1350814 the pucks laying in the crease he put it in it should be a goal he made a mistake theres nothing i can do about it
1350815 theres no quit in this room all the games have been pretty close
1350816 its been little bounces here and there we have to regroup and forget these games
1350817 i thought for the first two periods we played a perfect road game
1350818 we had some good opportunities and snuffed theirs out we took at bad penalty at the end of the second period and then we put a gun to our head with that 5 on 3 opportunity and they converted
1350819 the caps were the hottest teams going into the playoffs
1350820 goals off lucky bounces dinged posts and powerplay goals off of iffy penalties
1350821 the caps are the hottest team coming into the playoffs
1350822 the pens havent been tested in the playoffs yet but the flyers just shut down washington and montreal
1350823 someone do something to get this guy away from me
1350824 mum brother son daughter dad what will make you pick up the phone
1350825 the safer knowsley partnership is working hard to rid our streets of the scourge of gun crime tougher laws effective enforcement and working closely with communities is making a real difference but we need to keep up the momentum and i would encourage anyone who has information about gun crime in their area to tell us as you can see from the results your information really can make a difference
1350826 we said lets go out and throw out everything we have in the third period
1350827 lets just empty the tanks and put out every effort we possibly have
1350828 i think theres a little bit of doubt in their mind
1350829 this comeback doesnt happen very often and then you top it off with this game weve done a lot of things that are great for our character to show that we have it at times tonight we showed our nerves and our younger players showed their youth but we survived we really took it to them
1350830 its really one of the only shots i have as a shooter coming around dallas defenceman nicklas grossman is going to drop if he does move at all its going to open up and the short side was just there thats where i was shooting the whole time
1350831 our team battles through adversity but those were two critical points of the game
1350832 i still havent seen a distinct kicking motion but i suppose somebody else did the other one i agree with the call but if brenden morrow isnt cross checked in the back he would have put the puck down and in the back of the net those are two critical plays in the game and you have to find a way to overcome that
1350833 every game we lose we give them more life but i like our position better than theirs
1350834 the third period was our downfall we have to move on earn our breaks we earned this 3 2 lead
1350835 when the puck is chipped out hes got that extra step that a few guys might not be able to get around the defence
1350836 he just has great speed and obviously when he gets the chance hes going to put it in the back of the net that gave our bench a huge lift
1350837 one of the keys to our success has been our discipline we took a lot of penalties and they capitalized
1350838 its tough to keep the flow and momentum when youre killing off that many penalties
1350839 youd like to have those chances back but thats not the way it is
1350840 those are mistakes that youd like to see cleaned up
1350841 well embrace the challenge to make history in coming back from a 3 0 deficit
1350842 weve been sitting back too much and not playing sharks hockey there were a few blips but it was a pretty solid effort tonight
1350843 its probably the toughest loss in my career so far
1350844 hopefully we will continue to grow as a team and that the next time were in this situation well be a better team
1350845 but in a few weeks there will be 29 teams saying the same thing only one team can win the stanley cup the flyers seemed to take advantage of every bounce and break they got
1350846 its not an easy situation for price im sure he felt the pressure and that there are a few goals hes like to have back but you have to learn from these experiences
1350847 theres a goaltender who will win a stanley cup for this team one day hes that good
1350848 i thought he was going to knock it down but i guess he just missed it
1350849 they have good players but sometimes you need to get breaks too
1350850 with what they had against us i hope they have some left
1350851 ive played for 15 years in this league ive been watching games for 33 years i had never seen that in my life
1350852 sid was driving hard to the net and it kind of bounced off him and the puck just came up to me and i just tried to shoot at the net and it was a lucky one
1350853 for a guy thats been criticized and known for not scoring big goals in the playoffs when its clutch time obviously he scored an unbelievably big goal
1350854 i had some bad playoffs and i had some good playoffs i cant control what other people say about my playoff performance
1350855 i always try and im on a great team right now and i can just enjoy the ride
1350856 it wasnt the best feeling after being ahead 2 0 to give up two goals and go to overtime but it was important to get it together mentally
1350857 we went to the locker room before the overtime and everybody had a great feeling
1350858 i know im going to play somewhere next season i still feel ive got many years left if i decide to work at it
1350859 we were facing a very good hockey club theyve got young legs playing without fear
1350860 they didnt get tired i thought they were going to get tired and they didnt get tired they keep coming keep coming
1350861 we got ourselves into trouble again with penalties and there were some momentum swings because of that
1350862 hes been great hes a big big man with lots of skill were lucky to have him
1350863 we feel good about that im not taking anything away from what we did but their team was depleted by the end here
1350864 hes been big now for a long time he broke gordies record in march and then he broke his record here today so good for him if youre going to break records you might as well break gordie howes
1350865 i think they gave up after 4 1 so i got a couple of freebies
1350866 i dont expect to score that much the rest of the playoffs
1350867 ive seen injuries in the playoffs but ive never seen that many injuries
1350868 everybody deals with them over the course of the playoffs and seasons but we had an abnormal share
1350869 we didnt respond well 4 1 against these guys you start trying to cheat and trying to score goals to get back in and its 6 7 1 to get out of that first period 1 1 would have been a pretty big accomplishment
1350870 if it doesnt get solved that would be it but well see what happens
1350871 thats where you start everything if you dont believe you dont have a chance you have to believe that anything is possible then you have to put the pieces together
1350872 we have to learn from our mistakes and we have to be strong in our building
1350873 it wont be easy but we dont want to come back here
1350874 its not a new series but hopefully we have them thinking we think we can do it were going to go for it in pittsburgh theres no other way for us
1350875 its great but we have to make sure we play a little longer
1350876 enjoy the moment its too bad that we got into a tough situation maybe its happening for a reason that were down 3 0 you never know we should just play
1350877 we are going back to pittsburgh still in the series and that is the most important thing we live to play another day and we intend to win
1350878 thats one of the first times ive seen a player on the breakaway try to finish his check
1350879 its a classless act by a superstar and there is no need for that in the game
1350880 its not like it was just a little slew foot its actually a full kick well put that in the back of our minds
1350881 we got a huge win and hopefully well carry the momentum over to sunday
1350882 we just lost three games and when ill sit down with the coaching staff i dont think i will want to change anything were doing
1350883 were playing great but martin biron is playing great right now
1350884 sometimes you dont have the ball as much as youd like but you take advantage of it when you do get it obviously wed like to get more shots and more chances but were taking advantage of what were getting right now
1350885 we have to have the mindset that saturday will be a game 7
1350886 but a lot of the time the puck is hitting him and he has no idea we need to get more traffic in front of him
1350887 i wasnt satisfied with careys play and he also recognizes that
1350888 that should not have been a penalty it was too late in the game and a questionable call
1350889 but a borderline interference penalty to montreal winger steve begin
1350890 because you didnt hear people saying jon stewart jewish writer when his book came out i guess being a mormon is just odd enough that people think its still a real story obviously to me it seems super normal its just my religion
1350891 i go to bible study on wednesday mornings i even teach sometimes but ill still get up on stage and be much scarier than marilyn manson it doesnt mean that as a christian you cant be a rocker or an entertainer its your lifestyle i never use bad language thats not gentlemanly alice might slit your throat but hed never use the f word
1350892 when you girls are saying your prayers tonight please ask god to help you to be good tomorrow cause nanaw needs a break

1350894 i wanted to do something big and bring people in to see what a great centre of quality services we have under one roof having activities like this gives us a chance to celebrate our community
1350895 working with professional artists and companies there are lots of networks who share the same goal to give talented people a chance the participants that apply and do not make the finals might be involved in other projects

1350914 were delighted hes agreed to a show the other side of the microphone for a change
1350915 i cant believe that this max cant find something real to complain about in this crazy world i think max is the bigot he obviously hates country music country singers and southerners
1350916 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
1350917 but i think that thats what they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian
1350918 you nigger lovers better get outa here before something happens to you
1350919 you nigger lovers better get outa here before something happens to you
1350920 sure the lyrics seem to endorse white male supremacy and yes i am a white male but you see this song is ironic because well because i just said so
1350921 white trash with money whos a victim of the liberal media
1350922 whether that will make any difference i dont know i havent heard him have a strong crackdown on economic exploitation in the ghettos payday loans predatory lending asbestos lead whats keeping him from doing that is it because he wants to talk white he doesnt want to appear like jesse jackson well see all that play out in the next few months and if he gets elected afterwards
1350923 he wants to appeal to white guilt you appeal to white guilt not by coming on as black is beautiful black is powerful basically hes coming on as someone who is not going to threaten the white power structure whether its corporate or whether its simply oligarchic and they love it whites just eat it up
1350924 you nigger lovers better get outa here before something happens to you
1350925 weve had amazing third periods so far in the playoffs
1350926 it was a big trip for us now its up to us to respond to this at home we know this is far from over but at the same time we had a great two days here every shift every night weve looked hungry
1350927 we can just relax now and push the pace and play as a desperate hockey team you just have to keep playing on you cant worry about your missed opportunities
1350928 we started good and we had a lead after the second period
1350929 we let it slip away we cant let it happen again we have to go there and win two weve been good on the road all season
1350930 ive been fighting it a bit through the first five periods and thats not a good feeling
1350931 i kept grinding away trying to make things happen and then sometimes you catch a break
1350932 a couple of bounces went against us in the last game and this time a couple went our way that was the difference
1350933 were just glad to get a split out of here
1350934 marty was probably going to have to be our best player and he was
1350935 three goals on 13 shots thats not what weve seen from him in the past
1350936 but those first two goals were good shots we had open nets and missed them but a good player makes his own luck and biron was good
1350937 last game we had a 3 2 lead and then they got that tying goal
1350938 but tonight we played with the desperation we had in the first round against washington
1350939 we didnt play our best hockey but we played well enough to get it done a lot of their shots came off the power play theyve got a great attack with sometimes five guys coming up the ice
1350940 its a good feeling but we played well as a group
1350941 i liked the way we didnt sit back this time
1350942 we kept up the pressure on them in the third period marty was amazing you wont get anywhere without a good goalie and hes certainly pulling his weight and with what hes going through with his wife giving birth on april 14 to a daughter it must be hectic at home but hes been so focused on the ice
1350943 hes a tough kid and i have a lot of respect for him and steve begin but to go up and sucker punch kimmo on the play at the end there thats cowardly in my opinion
1350944 kimmos our best player he was totally unsuspecting that leaves a bad taste in your mouth
1350945 for whatever reason the best way to describe it is i sort of got lost for a few years
1350946 it really took a lot of soul searching for me to get my priorities in order and for me to start feeling good about myself and to start taking care of my kids and things like that
1350947 i finally realized what was important it wasnt easy but it was definitely fulfilling and i am appreciative of the experience i wouldnt want to go through it again though
1350948 pain didnt bother me im a hockey player we ignore pain the biggest thing for me was i wasnt the father i wanted to be i wasnt the father the son the teammate or the friend i wanted to be i looked in the mirror and realized things had gotten so out of control not just from drinking and using but the fact i was ignoring my responsibilities i had checked out i didnt like hockey anymore i didnt like anything
1350949 i remember pulling into the place and thinking thank god i had done it before but this time was different this time i knew i was done i was able to start early on re establishing the relationships that were important to me
1350950 cheryl she said to me do you not think that if you start taking care of yourself everybody that loves you wont come back into your life
1350951 to me that was the moment when the light went on it gave me a glimmer of hope i sat there and watched everything slide away and i did nothing to help my own cause that was the moment when i said screw this i had gone as deep as i had ever been but i was determined from that point to get back the thing that killed me the most was i wasnt being the father that i wanted to be
1350952 nobody gave him anything he went to a gym i own six days a week worked with personal trainers and no matter what time they said to be there he was there he probably worked out more from november to april than he did throughout his entire career he really re committed himself sometimes working out twice a day he showed a personal commitment to trying to give himself every chance to get back to the nhl nothing was handed to him
1350953 i need to be here for my kids with my kids for me
1350954 my priorities are pretty simple sobriety family and then hockey if i dont have no 1 then i cant have no 2 and no 3
1350955 this was more our game than game 1 but we still didnt win it
1350956 you know we were better in terms of chances against but i think to a man they can still suggest to you they can play better and obviously we know we need to
1350957 as much as it might have been a bit of an improvement tonight our game is not where it needs to be in order to win the series
1350958 we take pride in our defensive side of the game as well
1350959 we can play on both sides of the puck we know what it takes to win if its a tight game well play a tight game and if its an open it up game we can open it up as well
1350960 we just tried to win every battle we could and just tried to get it out great job by flower he played unbelievable and our penalty kill has been pretty good so far and we want to keep doing it
1350961 we just have to go back home and still feel confident that we can beat this team
1350962 go back to new york worry about ourselves get two wins
1350963 i just got a couple of whacks behind my legs
1350964 and then my defence came in and took care of him pretty good its no big deal its part of playoff hockey
1350965 thats one thing about our team we can do it both ways
1350966 were great defensively were solid on both sides of the puck this team really seems to find ways to win and thats what we did today
1350967 i knew i had it underneath my pads and the guy kept swinging at my pads
1350968 i dont know if it was a quick whistle or what but if his intention was to blow the whistle and it hasnt crossed the goal line that seems like thats fair
1350969 as the game goes on its probably tougher to maintain but i thought definitely for the first half there was definite improvement there
1350970 we did some dance rehearsals and everything but then i found out the schedule and it was six days a week for a couple of months
1350971 and they wanted me to go to london after new york
1350972 i was very flattered to be offered that role and i love chicago but with my schedule and everything there was no way i could fit it in
1350973 2 tips for trainers re design the class activity here is a different way to do an end of the class evaluation instead of a smile sheet ask your learners to in small groups re design the program give them 10 minutes and ask them to do a rapid re design of the sequence scope and activities in the class you will be pleasantly surprised at the great ideas and rich data that this will yield

1350975 no customers or any other employees saw him undressed he just took off running around the side of the building toward euclid
1350976 we believe he may have some problems were not sure at this point
1350977 didnt cause problems with any of our patrons but it sounded like he may have been hurting himself
1350978 now is the time for a real debate on the future of public sector sports broadcasting which i know is under consideration and under review
1350979 all these 19 million people interested in cricket buy tv licences and surely they should have a right to expect that the public sector broadcasters mount bids for the nations summer sport
1350980 the bbc is astonished at the comments from the ecb
1350981 we have always said that any bid for live test cricket is subject to value for money and ability to schedule in our view neither of these criteria were met
1350982 we have consistently argued that not having cricket as a listed event puts it out of reach of all terrestrial broadcasters this is the ecbs choice and they are entitled to it it is absurd to blame the bbc for this outcome
1350983 a bidder may bid for part only of any package eg two test matches or whatever taking place in each season however any such bid must be for the full duration of the contract
1350984 we had countless meetings with broadcasters and i am convinced that we now have achieved the best deal available to cricket from those companies who expressed an interest in the rights

1350987 my mom loved being a mom and made sure her children knew every day how much joy we brought to her i hope to give that to my kids
1350988 when i saw they were big and screaming with healthy lungs i was at peace
1350989 also neversoft has stated its unsure how timely new in game tracks will be delivered on the playstation store a legitimate concern considering other parties have had trouble putting content up on sonys network as well
1350990 well get to regroup after a tough couple games here
1350991 hopefully going home and having a couple days will give us some momentum
1350992 if we use that as an excuse we have to do something else with our lives
1350993 he knows his body and said he was unable to go
1350994 you need to keep the score close and i didnt do that
1350995 we wanted to build off of what happened last game but it didnt happen
1350996 obviously a poor performance on our part they had the legs
1350997 hes big and strong and he reminded me of a mule that day
1350998 his offensive game really started to show up last year and now that his confidence has grown he is holding onto the puck and making plays
1350999 hes one of those big forwards that not only uses his size to his advantage but has nice hands
1351000 everybody likes big power forwards but theyre hard to find
1351001 it started to turn for me when i got to play more on the power play because cleary and homer were injured
1351002 there havent been too many guys that big and quick especially as a centre
1351003 hes made the most of his opportunity this year hes become a very key player for our team
1351004 its a really fun place to play the atmosphere is great
1351005 our goal was to come in and steal a game
1351006 you never know what it will be or how many goals it will take we didnt want to be denied marty had such a great first period for us to keep us in the game
1351007 ive had a lot of games over a lot of seasons against these guys after so many years and games i kind of feel comfortable out west
1351008 we need to do a better job on some guys on some of their lines
1351009 we need to get more shots and generate more traffic well make some changes and go from there
1351010 we turned it over against a great line you dont win the battles you give somebody like mike ribeiro two or three shots at making plays it should be one and then we snuff it and get the puck out
1351011 in life there are very few moments of clarity when you realize that things have completely changed
1351012 it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place
1351013 to shape the emotions motives reasoning and behaviors of selected foreign entities
1351014 its not about technology its about people and information sharing

1351021 our staffing issues of course make it difficult to deliver the value that justifies our fees
1351022 just too much work not enough people pressure from the company quite a bit of turnover and no coordination of the non deal stuff they want us and our staff to do
1351023 ubs does not believe that there was illegal conduct by any employee
1351024 we have found cases of poor judgment by certain individuals and are evaluating appropriate disciplinary measures for these individuals
1351025 it is frustrating that the new york attorney general has filed this complaint while we have been fully engaged in good faith negotiations with his office to bring liquidity to our clients holding auction rate securities
1351026 we need them to walk out and believe that this is a strong credit w sic strong ubs commitment to support the liquidity
1351027 we are not going to address specific emails taken out of context
1351028 ubs has acted in clients best interests in this matter
1351029 we continue to be impressed by the auction markets resiliency in the face of challenging times
1351030 our analyst struck the right balance between sounding cautionary notes and concluding that there were insufficient alarms to herald the imminent and unprecedented collapse of the ars market
1351031 why even bother with the ps3 eye if they dont add anything but cool visuals why not just buy the cards
1351032 who best excels in the defensive aspects of the game
1351033 top gear and gran turismo 5 in unholy union of awesomeness
1351034 i dont think youre ever happy on the bench when youre down three zip but theres a difference between not being happy and quitting
1351035 at that point down 3 0 we were a little shaky but it showed the character of this hockey team
1351036 we never quit this is a great accomplishment for that young group to be able to bounce back against at a team like the rangers who are really committed defensively
1351037 we havent been that loose all year but that team with all their fire power theyll make you pay
1351038 he generated a lot of scoring chances hes tough to play against he drew a lot of attention on the ice because of his work ethic and because of his speed i thought he played really well
1351039 there are times that a player has no choice but to hook him
1351040 in the playoffs once its midnight the most important game is the next game whether you win 1 0 or lose like this
1351041 it was a tough game not only for marc andre but also lundqvist lundqvist gave up five goals tonight but he looked good there were fluky goals on both sides
1351042 i like the way we started we dictated the game right from the start
1351043 the first half of the period we were all over them with our speed and our intensity
1351044 its never fun to be down 3 0 but we were talking on the bench saying stay positive anything can happen
1351045 those bang bang goals are tough especially for the road team
1351046 kid allthat is right with the world and can do no wrong who we must showcase on sunday on national tv or the world will end so well make one of the other 8 teams left play their 3rd game in 4 nights wonderful

1351057 their top line is dangerous but hes the next guy you have to worry about
1351058 he shut the door when the game was on the line
1351059 even though they got the first goal we felt like we were the better team
1351060 he was really good with filppula and samuelsson we said in the last series if we could get that line going we would be really good
1351061 we had a real good second period and we had some good chances to get the equalizer in the end
1351062 if you were to ask the guys that played in those series they wouldnt be commenting on this one now
1351063 so i dont really feel that this is the time for me to comment on or compare the series because theres new players on both sides

1351163 when the weather blows down here it really blows and during the winter our post was coming in soaking wet
1351164 getting our post wasnt an issue the postbox was on our land and everything was fine
1351165 being english i have a problem with trespassing on other peoples land to get my post
1351166 i asked is this a joke i think my husband was a little embarrassed by it
1351167 its almost like theyre the mafia holding our post as ransom
1351168 all because a postman doesnt want to get out of his car
1351169 im just back from vacation so im not up to speed on the matter
1351170 im guessing that most swedes wouldnt dare stand up and complain like this
1351171 our current population has dropped to 3 100 from a high of 5 500 thirty years ago we want to eventually get it back up to maybe around 4 000
1351172 we have had a lot of interest from other parts of sweden but also from places like russia germany and the netherlands
1351173 hopefully the people who come here will bring with them new business ideas and plenty of creativity
1351174 we who have always lived here are perhaps somewhat blind to the possibilities a new perspective could provide

1351183 he just phoned me up and told me he was going elsewhere
1351184 we made him an offer which i thought he might have taken but obviously the money wasnt good enough
1351185 he can go part time at ilkeston and get another job as well and earn more money than we can offer him
1351186 i couldnt offer him more i have to be careful with the pennies as its not like we only have to bring in one or two more players we need to bring a lot in still

1351192 while tim was performing he watched a man rush to the front of the stage
1351193 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1351194 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1351195 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1351196 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1351197 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1351198 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1351199 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1351200 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1351201 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1351202 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1351203 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

1351205 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1351206 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

1351209 help advertisers understand how online tv can be integrated effectively with their broadcast tv campaigns
1351210 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1351211 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1351212 editorially the two brands are a perfect match for each other
1351213 lonely planet has long wanted a magazine in its portfolio which we can now provide and the bbc has an array of travel programmes and talent that we can bring to the party
1351214 this is another major milestone for costa our strategy has always been to develop several different markets in china to fully capitalise on the vast opportunity presented by chinas continued economic growth and aspiring young consumers
1351215 todays opening in chinas capital city further enhances costas status as a major international brand
1351216 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1351217 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1351218 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1351219 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1351220 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1351221 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1351222 the senate is currently conducting an internal investigation in an attempt to discover who is behind this once we learn their identity that information will be turned over to law enforcement and we would expect it to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
1351223 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1351224 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1351225 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1351226 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1351227 his enemies shot their wad in the primary and he killed em hes got bigger bullets than they do so whats next terrill for governor
1351228 the senate is currently conducting an internal investigation in an attempt to discover who is behind this once we learn their identity that information will be turned over to law enforcement and we would expect it to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
1351229 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
1351230 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
1351231 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
1351232 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1351233 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1351234 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1351235 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1351236 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1351237 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

1351239 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
1351240 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
1351241 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
1351242 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
1351243 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1351244 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1351245 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1351246 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill

1351260 the office of the auditor general obtained compelling evidence which suggests that the citys gasoline supply has been and is continuing to be misappropriated
1351261 conditions exist which demonstrate a total lack of control over the citys fuel supply
1351262 francis who like lewenza and other speakers at tuesdays announcement in the foyer of the art gallery denounced the
1351263 francis said the city brought in human resources lawyer george king to provide advice on how to end the situation
1351264 but to city council to myself and to this community its insulting that hes able to article at a firm while hes on sick leave
1351265 weve sought legal advice and the mayor is not privy to that advice
1351266 if the mayor would like to involve himself in this situation wed certainly invite him to one of our in camera meetings
1351267 he has doctor verification for his sickness and we have to respect that
1351268 if the mayor wanted to call me i could apprise him of all these issues and what the board is trying to do the issue about bell taking a law course is nothing new it was reported back in march as was bells desire for a leave of absence according to the star
1351269 several sources indicated bell recently completed his law degree and needs time to complete his articling duties
1351270 the articling term is ten months within this ten month period an articling student at law may take up to two weeks of vacation
1351271 the student at law agrees to serve the principal as an articled student at law commencing the day of 2008 for consecutive months
1351272 6 during his her service disregarding any vacation not exceeding a total of two weeks during the ten month articling term or examination preparation time mentioned in paragraph 2 the student at law was absent with my permission details of and reason s for are
1351273 fulfilling an agreement with the library to fund his law degree
1351274 he has legitimate stress and medical concerns confirmed through regular doctor visits something he thinks city officials should not discuss publicly
1351275 why cant we run government like we run our private sector businesses

1351278 searching for a corporate savior the irrational quest for charismatic ceos
1351279 previously ceos were about as well known as their chauffeurs
1351280 but something happened when lee iacocca was credited with single handedly saving an american icon
1351281 the image of a ceo changed from being a capable administrator to a leader a motivating flamboyant leader with a new task in the late 1980s and early 90s business tried to redefine itself it was no longer about the profane task of making money but concerned with vision values mission essentially religious terms

1351283 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
1351284 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
1351285 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
1351286 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
1351287 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

1351299 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1351300 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1351301 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1351302 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1351303 this sensor doesnt resemble any other light sensors previously discovered
1351304 that doesnt mean shining an ultraviolet light on people in wheelchairs will suddenly allow them to walk
1351305 but it does give us a tool that we can use to solve the mysteries of nerve cell communication and could ultimately help us understand the biology of everything from sleep and memory to depression
1351306 the new work from ken millers lab has identified a new way that organisms can sense light distinct from the previously known light sensing mechanism used in the eye
1351307 it will be interesting to see whether the lite 1 light sensing mechanism will also lead to new insights into human sensory perception
1351308 without signals from this network neurons cannot talk to each other or to muscle cells to produce movement so the mutants just lie paralyzed on the culture plate even if you poke and prod them
1351309 when you are only a few cells thick getting a sunburn is fatal
1351310 were a long way from any treatments based on this research but i think weve opened up a door that we didnt know was there before
1351311 theres a lot of work left to be done but im excited to see where this discovery leads us
1351312 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1351313 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
1351314 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1351315 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1351316 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1351317 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1351318 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1351319 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1351320 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

1351350 we look at the right an individual has to privacy we do have that right hello corporations and the fact that just because people have sex lives visible to the public whether exhibitionistic professional or simply by the mere fact of being a sexual minority such as lgbt or female does not mean someone deserves to have their privacy violated to be stalked or harassed or that they are asking for it

1351369 theres a glimmer of hope in the neon city of nevada where home sales are starting to heat up after two dismal years in fact sales in vegas have risen over the past six months
1351370 bank owned foreclosed properties are setting the pace with prices falling the homes are grabbing attention the median home price was 225 000 in june down from a peak of 315 000 in june 2006
1351371 about 60 of everything that is selling is foreclosed properties

1351382 air pollutants are also responsible for the acidification of forests and water ecosystems and eutrophication of soils and waters leading to a limited supply of oxygen in rivers and lakes
1351383 one of the key reasons transport is still such a major cause of air pollution in europe is because transport users rarely have to pay for the pollution they cause
1351384 currently member states are forbidden from including pollution charges in road tolls
1351385 the commission just last month proposed to change the rules a move that we urge the parliament and ministers to support

1351387 the reach legislation is extremely complex as it brings together over 40 separate pieces of legislation that govern european chemical safety
1351388 however businesses should not fall into the trap of believing that the legislation only affects chemical manufacturers
1351389 the impact of the legislation will be felt right down the supply chain to the end user any business manufacturing or importing industrial chemicals will need to register the substances they use or they will no longer be able to continue manufacturing their products
1351390 while the affect of the regulation will be widespread the legislation is expected to have particular impact on sectors including transport and textiles

1351396 so you know when the head couple is doing something the side couple is doing something else everybody is in a formation it all equals out to a square
1351397 we do lessons we do two sets of 10 lessons and it takes about 20 weeks to really learn how to dance
1351398 so eventually by the end of 20 weeks you can dance like these people are dancing now
1351399 once you learn it here you can dance it anywhere its just like everything else worth learning it takes time and as you can see there are a lot people who are all good friends i know people from practically all over the world i have really good friends in arizona california and canada and became friends with them through dancing
1351400 we only use the tune of popular music our music is all reworked specifically for square dancing
1351401 ive been a part of the club for about four years
1351402 its just for fun we dance give lessons here and we have dances the second and fourth fridays in fredericktown at the old high school we visit other clubs and they come to us
1351403 they are a lot of fun we can have as many as six seven eight squares dancing sometimes and its really a great time a social time where you get to visit its just an old fashioned good time and folks enjoy it
1351404 if you dont want to dance you can come and watch and see what it is all about some of the people really get into it and wear the western square dance clothes and some of them just come causal in jeans and a shirt but you dont have to dress up in order to come and enjoy the dance
1351405 there is a lot of dancing going on not as much as it was back in the 70s it slowed down but is still there
1351406 but i can remember the dixie squares whenever i was in high school because a friend of mines parents danced with them and that was over 300 years ago
1351407 we had actually square danced many years ago and have gotten away from it because of travel and work commitments
1351408 square dancing is a wonderful activity that keeps you going and moving but its the people that is the most fun they are the nicest people you ever want to meet they are friendly outgoing and like to have a good time without the things that are difficult to do getting back into square dancing is just fun and entertaining and its become a nice part of our lives in retirement
1351409 anyone who is interested in dancing they are welcome to come
1351410 it keeps me busy i get to meet new people and see a whole bunch of friends that i know
1351411 its just a fellowship thing we thank each other for being here and we are all just real friendly
1351412 you can be a single couple team or whatever and still do this for fun and its great exercise

1351417 six years on and hot on the heels of the indiana jones revival the mummy has been awakened once more this time however having exhausted everyones patience with egypt the team have taken a leaf out of indys book and relocated to china the mummy in question being that of the first emperor and played in a perfect piece of casting by kung fu hero jet li cue all sorts of oriental mysticism and computer generated action as brendan fraser once more battles the undead aided by john hannah as the bumbling sidekick the less said about the odd decision to give fraser a teenage son this time or to re cast rachel weiszs character when she proved unavailable rather than simply write her out the better nonetheless this is a far more successful revival than most could have hoped for especially coming as it does from the director who brought us such braindead actioners as the fast and the furious and xxx and is arguably a far better sequel than the mummy returns as the cliche goes if you liked that then youll love this

1351423 there are many in this community who support the school board and respect how you have responded to the issue
1351424 many cannot condone the way the community has responded to those who dont support mr freshwater
1351425 im not against the school board im against this decision
1351426 ive been a public school teacher for 24 years 21 years in this building
1351427 it is my understanding that the members of this board of education have elected to have my termination hearing heard by a referee
1351428 one i never never branded or burnt a person i have never branded or burnt myself i have never branded or burnt or put a religious mark on my family i have never done that to a student
1351429 two i never taught evolution and creation in a public classroom the written text reads i have never taught creationism nor intelligent design in a public classroom
1351430 three i have never taught anything in the public classroom that was prohibited by the mandates of the curriculum for state standards
1351431 four i have never exceeded the boundaries or the parameters established for being a teacher monitor facilitator or supervisor of fca fellowship of christian athletes
1351432 i have been told that the members of the school board likely have a preconceived notion of the facts surrounding these untrue allegations
1351433 this case is and remains to be my abridged my paraphrased personal bible on my desk
1351434 and the troops came out to support my bible on the desk
1351435 i do not teach creationism or intelligent design my science standards are evolution
1351436 i am what i am i have a strong belief all i want to do is put my personal bible on my desk
1351437 the school board has elected to have a referee essentially hear the facts of the case and report back to them
1351438 because of that john wanted the opportunity to look the school board members in the eye and tell them exactly and deny these allegations
1351439 i think john did that and did so very effectively
1351440 because john has been castigated and tried in the court of public opinion so its only best to make certain the school board members are held accountable to the very public information thats already been disseminated in an untruthful manner
1351441 oh yes i will twenty four years of doing it teaching i have a passion for it i love the kids i wouldnt be a teacher if i didnt love kids
1351442 you heard some of these people today who pointed out some very clear credible accusations against the investigation demonstrating it was not objective and it did have a slant a biased direction because of that i think its very important were going to have an opportunity to challenge that
1351443 thats why we have the opportunity here in america because it still is america we have the opportunity to present our defense and were going to do exactly that
1351444 you had the opportunity to examine his credibility you had the opportunity for him to stand in front of all those people and make those statements as he did he did not have to and i will tell you originally i wasnt necessarily in favor of that being done but then again john felt it was very important to do so
1351445 welcome to the wonderful world of not knowing what the hells going on

1351462 as 90 per cent of the attacks were against us we thought if we moved out we would remove the source of the problem

1351473 the molecular interaction in oxygen revealed by this study is due to the unique fact that oxygens outmost orbital is half filled with two unpaired electrons
1351474 as the molecules are squeezed into smaller volumes at high pressure electrons in the orbital inevitably move about trying to pair with electrons in the neighboring molecules
1351475 the behavior of oxygen at high pressure demonstrates one of the most profound effects of pressure on matter which transforms the colorless air we breath into colorful dense solids
1351476 the drastic change in the appearance of this familiar gas is due to the bonding changes in oxygen induced by high pressure
1351477 this is the first demonstration of how new tools can be used to probe the subtle interactions between atoms and molecules that lead to the formation of entirely new crystal structures
1351478 these new structures may give rise to entirely new electronic magnetic and other physical properties that could lead to new technologies
1351479 it is exciting to find that oxygen forms molecular clusters under high pressure through similar mechanism and this opens a possibility for new forms of materials at high pressure with potential for technical applications

1351496 seriously jeopardizes the trial itself and excludes any possibility of regularity
1351497 the offer was as follows i must withdraw not only from public but also from party offices and completely disappear from the public arena not give interviews and not even publish literary works in a word become invisible long enough for the dayton agreement to be implemented in full
1351498 there is no doubt that this offer was made in the name of the usa
1351499 not only because our officials received him as the authorised emissary of the usa but also because when we met in person and i told him of my discussion with president carter mr holbrooke told me before very credible witnesses that he respected president carter but he was now working for president clinton that is literally what he said
1351500 not because of the international force whom i used to pass quietly and without demonstration but because of possible adventurers and glory hunters
1351501 our intelligence services noted many aggressive activities by international forces in places from which i had just departed
1351502 clearly organised to liquidate someone not at all to arrest him but when they failed they were declared to be exercises
1351503 the intention to liquidate me was more than obvious as was confirmed by the current statement of mr holbrooke who regrets that there is no death sentence here and it therefore cannot be pronounced on me although that is what he would like
1351504 get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic or at least go to bijeljina just as long as i left pale
1351505 completely in keeping with this agreement which was not holbrookes private business but a matter of state
1351506 unknown civilians showed me a badge so quickly that i could not identify it took me out of a public transport vehicle and held me in an unknown place for 74 hours during this time i was not informed of the rights to which i am entitled if they abducted me in the name of international justice nor did they tell me who they were and what they intended to do with me nor did they allow me to speak with one of their chiefs or allow me to make a telephone call they did not even allow me to send a single sms message to one of my new friends so that they would not go round the hospitals and mortuaries looking for me nor would they send such a message on my behalf for those 74 hours i did not exist and after that they handed me over to the special court and an investigating judge after which everything was regular
1351507 concerned by the announcement of a new indictment which i will not have time to study but i am still more concerned by his statement that it will all go very quickly and i myself wonder how the chief prosecutor knows this
1351508 what regularity can i expect when everything takes place in an atmosphere in which regardless of what truths may be demonstrated in this room no one on earth believes in the possibility of an acquittal
1351509 you get less house and property for the same price but were willing to make that sacrifice to save on gas prices and commuting costs
1351510 churring filled the twilight then close at hand came a soft quick call and we saw the silhouettes of a pair of nightjars their long wings rose and fell as they encircled us the reason was a fledgling on the path a few metres ahead its eye gleaming in the torch light the parents circled us even faster like in a playground game clapping their wings as we approached the bird on the path silently flew off

1351533 i am honored to be selected to a group of collegiate football coaches to visit our troops in the middle east the week leading up to memorial day
1351534 my family and i believe this to be a small way to thank and support our troops for defending our country as a proud notre dame alumnus i consider this trip to be a privilege and im looking forward to this with great anticipation
1351535 i thought that was a small token of appreciation representing notre dame just a small token of appreciation for me to be one of a group of college football coaches to go over there and try to mix and mingle with a whole bunch of our troops that have a lot more important job than any of us have
1351536 i feel both honored and privileged to have been asked and im looking forward to going and i think this will be an enlightening experience
1351537 we love the soldiers and their willingness to sacrifice for our country
1351538 we want to support them not only in prayer but also in person i look forward to meeting as many of our men and women in the armed forces as possible during the visit
1351539 im looking forward to the opportunity to spend time with the troops in the middle east they have made so many sacrifices to help protect our country and this is a small way that i along with the other coaches on the tour can say thank you i know well get to visit with a lot of college football fans and hope to see several auburn tigers along the way
1351540 i expect that this will be a once in a lifetime experience i am really looking forward to meeting the men and women of our armed forces and am truly thrilled to have this opportunity
1351541 college football is an all american sport it truly showcases the drive determination and teamwork that is similar to the u s armed force we are proud to bring this tour to our military men and women and my hat goes off to these coaches for spending their downtime with our troops
1351542 im honored to have been appointed a member of the presidents committee on behalf of my wife maura our son charlie and daughter hannah who is globally developmentally delayed i look forward to using my voice to help raise awareness and doing some good for individuals with special needs that may not have that ability to do so on their own im very appreciative to president bush for this appointment and am excited about the opportunity
1351543 i was definitely surprised to be selected by the eagles
1351544 i had no idea that they were even interested in me
1351545 learning from mike and brodericks experience will be instrumental in my success here
1351546 i think that i am definitely going to add some great depth along with some play making ability and high energy to the dt rotation
1351547 i am used to playing inside still cause ive been doing it my whole life
1351548 i feel comfortable with both the 3 4 and 4 3 i feel that physically i am a more natural inside player but after my success as an end at notre dame i think that i can do well in either position
1351549 both defenses first focus is to shut down the run
1351550 probably the biggest differences is the aggressiveness of coach johnsons defense simply put he gets after it
1351551 being able to get a good push up the middle is crucial to the success of our defense
1351552 my plan is to work hard make plays and build their faith in me
1351553 i was taken to pats my first day in philly it was delicious i am a food guy so i cant wait to try more great philly food
1351554 its awesome to be playing with vic again he was my roommate for two years in college and we are still very close
1351555 i am confident that they can have a successful season this fall if they keep at the pace coach weis has set for them ill definitely have my eye on them
1351556 i look to back up the two starters and be in that rotation dts in the nfl dont play the whole game and jim johnson likes to rotate a lot on the line so im hoping to get in there as much as possible
1351557 apesar de eu ter conseguido a vaga no torneio pr ol mpico do canad neste ano foi o rio que fez a diferen a
1351558 merrill sold 95 million in ars to 165 massachusetts investors in january and february even as executives knew the market could fail
1351559 he believes merrill is well positioned for the coming years because several of its businesses like wealth management do not depend on borrowing or leverage as the industry calls it
1351560 coach beamer made himself available to us it was him running the clinic not one of his assistants
1351561 we went through everything they did watched tape went over drills
1351562 for me it was very little to do with understanding special teams
1351563 it was about how to coach his approach to getting guys to perform at a higher level of efficiency
1351564 one of the things i wanted to understand was his beamers idea of involvement his personal involvement with special teams
1351565 he sort of had a lot of the same problems i had years ago at one time he was the defensive coordinator then he got involved in calling plays on offense and then he kind of moved away from both of those things other than to throw his two cents in on everything and became much more involved with special teams
1351566 his special teams didnt really pick up the tempo until he had more direct involvement where the kids knew they were answering to the head coach
1351567 they blocked a whole bunch of punts but they also probably roughed the punter more times than anyone in america too
1351568 theres risk reward there if you want to go ahead and bring it after every time you have to be willing for everyone in the place to boo you every time you rough the punter at the same time
1351569 i can see me doing that i can definitely see me doing that
1351570 whether or not they actually go to block a punt or not whoever is punting the ball is thinking oh my god this is virginia tech theyre coming to block the punt and that in and of itself has some value
1351571 for every punt they block or every kick they block they force a shank or they force a hurried operation because people are worried about them and theres something to be said for that
1351572 coach beamer spent the morning with us then coach weis spent some time with the offense and i went with a gentleman by the name of coach cavanaugh who has known my dad dating back to the bronx so hes known me since i was in diapers
1351573 i had a guy coach cavanugh i was familiar with and very comfortable with that i could ask any question i wanted to and we sat and watched more tape
1351574 what you do is you go down and you see how they organize things you see how they space things out you take tidbits here and there and you find a way to incorporate them into what it is you believe in and what it is you do
1351575 we must put an end to the attacks on innocent citizens
1351576 we do believe this was the last fatah stronghold in gaza
1351577 we were driving from our home in ramallah to a cousins wedding in jenin with our three daughters sitting in the back we had to turn around because of engine trouble and as we passed the yitzhar settlement junction we saw four people on the road my wife said watch out but it was too late a large slab had been thrown through our windshield
1351578 he the settler dropped it right on us my wife made a sound and began bleeding i stopped and then decided to continue to hiwwara checkpoint outside of nablus as i opened the car doors my daughter fell out injured the slab had made it all the way to the back windscreens

1351580 the mod was perhaps slow to appreciate the potential of uavs but now recognises the important contribution that they can make
1351581 the mod must push forward with its planned improvements so that our armed forces can continue to achieve information superiority over the enemy
1351582 they have a crucial role to play in future operations and we will continue to invest in them

1351617 i was hoping to reinvigorate the egg cream phenom that existed in the early 1900s maybe every diner and soda shop will have it
1351618 i wanted to reintroduce the egg cream to a whole generation of people
1351619 it s one of those things that s really surprising to me that it never really went anywhere outside of new york
1351620 that is one of the reasons that my grandfather said he never could leave new york because he couldn t find a an egg cream
1351621 when i first opened my store in the west village and i put it on the menu and none of my staff were from new york so they didn t know what an egg cream was
1351622 it takes a few moments to marry the three tastes the creaminess and the bubbles and the chocolate
1351623 we were like there are no eggs don t worry
1351624 they kept on calling it an egg cream even though there was no egg in it

1351628 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
1351629 as soon as the legal constraints barring disclosure are removed we will make public as much information as possible
1351630 we will do that at one time in one place we will do that after those who were injured and the families of those who died are briefed which is only appropriate
1351631 i dont believe it will be helpful to respond piecemeal to any judgments made by anyone before they know a fuller set of facts
1351632 what has bothered me is the unscientific bumbling approach of our investigators

1351639 i talked to shawn a couple of times and we didnt even talk about why hes not here or anything
1351640 it was just hey get yourself taken care of wed love to have you in due time hell be here sooner or later
1351641 we go on without him until he shows up and hes ready
1351642 after dealing with all that what kind of physical shape is he going to be in if those are the problems im sure youre not hitting the gym every day but this is between him and andy hes going to have to explain it and when andy feels the need to put him back in hell put him back in
1351643 andrews has got to take care of his business and get himself right and get back here everything else doesnt matter right now you miss you give other guys opportunities thats what you do so the other guy is getting an opportunity and hes doing a good job with it

1351693 and the major side effects from statin drugs are liver problems and also statin induced myopathy which is muscle pain and weakness other problems include fatigue and memory problems
1351694 the doctors and the pharmacists are not educated in drug induced nutrient depletion its not talked about
1351695 why arent people told this stuff why isnt your doctor or pharmacist telling you that your drug depletes zinc out of your body its because vitamins arent deemed important unless its very very well known doctors are clueless they think drugs and surgery can solve all of the problems that we have
1351696 ill show them a list of the potential depletion problems of their drug and theyll say oh magnesium depletion can cause muscle cramps and depression
1351697 and theyre reading all of the depletion problems and theyll say oh thats me
1351698 i see it in my practice on a daily basis oh doc im on lipitor or im on vasotec or wellbutrin or vioxx and i dont feel well and we feel that its not all drug induced deficiencies but in part its side effects seem to be related to nutrient deficiencies

1352206 in general the bundeswehr german military has a special interest in the serious and authentic portrayal of the events of july 20 1944 and stauffenbergs person
1352207 we believe it will go a long way towards reminding the world that even within the ranks of the german military there was real resistance to the nazi regime
1352208 aside from his obvious admiration of the man he is portraying mr cruises personal beliefs have absolutely no bearing on the movies plot themes or content

1352282 i want to pay a tribute to a young man who gave me my worst seventy minutes on the football field his name was payne he played left guard for lehigh he weighed about 145 pounds was of slight build and seemed to have a sort of sickly pallor i have never seen him since but i take this occasion to say this was the greatest little guard i ever met at least he was great that day payne had been playing back of the line during part of the season but was put in at guard against me i had a hunch that he was going to bite me in the ankle when he lined up the first time for he bristled up and tore into me like a wild cat i have met a goodish few guards in my day and was accustomed to almost any form of warfare but this payne went around me like a cooper around a barrel and broke through the line and downed the runners in their leg in sight and hung on for dear life he darted through between my legs would vault over me what he did to me was a shame he was not rough but was just the opposite i never laid a hand on him all the afternoon he would make a world beater in the game as it is played to day
1352283 tell him not to worry about me better look out for himself
1352284 send word over to haughton and ask him how he likes that ask him if he thinks im all in perhaps he would like to have me quit now
1352285 sometimes for a few days before the game an old blue may come down to does all the coaching the cambridge match is for blood and while friendly enough is likely to be much more savage than any other in the match i played in which oxford won 35 3 the record score in the whole series which started in 1872 we had three men severely injured in the first three minutes of the game one of our star backs was carried off the field with a broken shoulder while our captain was kicked in the head and did not come out of his daze until about seven oclock that evening he played throughout the game however our secretary was off the field with a knee cap out of place for more than half the game a game of rugby by the way consists of two 45 minute halves with a three minute intermission there are no substitutes and if a man is injured his team plays one man short we beat cambridge that year with thirteen men the greater part of the game twelve for some time against their full team of fifteen their only try touchdown in plain american was scored when we had twelve men on the field we were champions of england that year and did not lose a match through the fall season though we tied one game with the great harlequins club of london whom we afterward beat in the return game of the fine fellows who made up that great oxford team six are dead five of them somewhere in france

1352294 i got to know walter camps methods and ways of playing so that
1352295 during my last two years of football the rushers were unanimously of
1352296 i remember once in my senior year our divergence of views on this question about three weeks before the final game nearly split our team and that as a result i nearly received the doubtful honor of becoming the captain of a defeated yale team camp fearful of wet weather and possible snow at the thanksgiving game and with channing eaton and fred remington as the heavy yale ends and everybody big in the rush line excepting myself was trying to develop us with as little kicking as possible and was sensitive because of the protests from the us sport clocks we were all summoned one evening to his room in durfee the situation explained together with his unwillingness to assume the responsibility of captain unless his ideas were followed his fear of defeat if they were not followed his willingness to continue on the team as a halfback and to do his best and his resignation as captain with the suggestion of my taking the responsibility of the position things looked blue for yale when walter walked out of the door but after some ten minutes discussion we decided that the open game was the better despite camps opinion to the contrary but that we could not play the open game without camp as captain some one was sent out to bring walter back matters were smoothed out we played the open game and never lost a touchdown during the season but during the four years i was on the yale varsity we never lost but one touchdown from which a goal was kicked and there were no goals kicked from the field this goal was lost to princeton and i think was in the fall of 78 the year that princeton won the championship the two men that were more than anybody else responsible for the record were eugene baker and walter camp but behind it all was the old yale spirit which seems to show itself better on the football field than in any other branch of athletics
1352297 we came here to play football not to play against phenomenal kicking

1352354 por el tiempo y por la capacidad operativa no era posible abarcar el c rculo completo entonces se deten a al sujeto que estaba vendiendo en la calle y pasaba a control de detenci n no lleg bamos al financista o al laboratorio clandestino de la m sica ni a la imprenta clandestina
1352355 en el caso de la primera operaci n de libros que hicimos en la que incautamos 82 mil ejemplares el principal imputado era un ex empleado de una importante editorial en ese caso l ten a mucho conocimiento del comercio del libro de hecho ocupaba dos casas pareadas una de ellas s lo para almacenar ejemplares destinados a provincia sin embargo aparte de este caso no hemos detectado un nexo entre imprentas clandestinas y editoriales
1352356 hab a autores best seller como coelho isabel allende y marcela serrano sin embargo el grueso era lectura escolar complementaria lo que nos llam la atenci n a nosotros y a los expertos de las editoriales era la calidad de los libros que era muy buena era muy dificil distinguir un pirata de un original en este caso el imputado llevaba alrededor de seis meses ejerciendo el comercio ilegal
1352357 seguramente otra unidad policial detect una imprenta que imprim a pirater a formalmente de d a y de noche claro que debe haber muchas m s estamos trabajando en eso
1352358 casi dos millones de d lares en el valor del precio de los libros originales
1352359 no necesariamente por eso el trabajo es m s complejo que incautar lo que est en las calles o en los persas hay que buscar al distribuidor en el lugar donde se acopian existen librer as establecidas que adem s de originales comercializan libros falsificados y los distribuyen
1352360 la ley se ala que deben ser destinados al autor que es contactado a trav s del archivo nacional nosotros no podemos donarlo hemos recibido muchos llamados de directores de colegios de provincia pidi ndonos donar estos libros pero por ley no podemos hacerlo ser a como legitimar el pirateo
1352361 establecimos que los impresores de libros piratas iban a las librer as a ofrecer libros en mochilas para evitar ser sorprendidos en la v a p blica con una caja grande pero se estableci que los due os de algunas librer as del centro ninguna connotada que venden estos textos contactaban a los ambulantes no es que los ambulantes vayan a la imprenta sino que van a las librer as peque as
1352362 en pleno centro las calles santo domingo catedral san diego en provincia es lo mismo es el ambulante el que va a buscar los libros falsificados a determinadas librer as no a al imprenta venden en promedio a 1 500 pesos cuando el precio promedio de los originales es de 6 mil pesos
1352363 los ambulantes que venden pirater a en la calle est n coludidos con los delincuentes incluso los defienden cuando la polic a detiene a alguno
1352364 lamentablemente aqu en la pirater a tambi n se ocupan menores de edad hay familias enteras que se dedican a la pirater a
1352365 hemos desbaratado laboratorios clandestinos de m sica de pel culas en donde toda la familia trabajaba en la v a p blica tambi n se usan menores que se contactan con delincuentes y con el consumo de drogas

1352401 obama is a tad cooler than mccain on probably 57 fronts said emily goulding 25 of los angeles
1352402 obamas better looking than mccain obamas more stylish than mccain obamas more fit than mccain he refers to better music than mccain
1352403 obamas big with the kids everyone knows that said tom johnson 21 of norfolk va
1352404 mccain that guys not cool i just cant call mccain cool
1352405 its got to be obama said david munn 20 of keene n
1352406 hes younger i think he has more of a connection with my generation i just think he communicates better to my generation especially with issues in iraq mccain is all right but not as cool as obama
1352407 cool thing down hes an avid basketball player listens to jay z on his ipod and was on the cover of this months issue of rolling stone magazine
1352408 illiterate when it comes to using a computer he turns 72 next month and if elected hed be the oldest president in american history to begin his first term
1352409 coolness or the perception of it at least really matter to young voters
1352410 i dont think you can ignore that factor said james kotecki a 22 year old political video blogger who achieved fame on youtube last year after he interviewed former republican presidential candidate ron paul in koteckis georgetown university dorm room
1352411 what obamas been able to do is capitalize on his hipness at least as far as younger voters go said kotecki whose video commentaries now appear on politico com the website for the washington political newspaper
1352412 i think its not that they dont support his issues and his policies but younger voters are more willing to work for him and work passionately for him because hes someone who resonates more on their wavelength
1352413 coolness is often associated with youth but elder status doesnt automatically signify
1352414 you can certainly be cool at any age kotecki said
1352415 look at hugh hefner hell be cool til the day he dies but for him and for ron paul or anybody whos elderly and whos cool part of it is what they represent that makes them that
1352416 the most important thing in terms of reaching youth is not being cool its being authentic or true to who you are goodstein said
1352417 i think hed look ridiculous if he tried to purposefully seem younger than he is if he started doing extreme sports or something ridiculous
1352418 has a very conservative image and that doesnt really help him either souris said
1352419 shes not the type like obamas wife who can get down and dirty with younger people and really relate to them
1352420 never look down to test the ground before taking your next step only he who keeps his eyes fixed on the far horizon will find the right road

1352440 the widespread nature of the illnesses points to an inherent weakness of our industrial food production system when production is centralized and fresh food travels thousands of miles contamination can spread farther and faster
1352441 the fda has said that local and homegrown tomatoes are unaffected by the current salmonella outbreak shopping at farmers markets for produce grown close to home is one way consumers can reduce their risk of food borne illness
1352442 it is a miracle for me because i was able to smile again laugh again and just feel alive again

1352449 but thats because rates are high when rates were low no one called for inflation targeting to be shelved
1352450 but i urge you not to suggest abandoning inflation targeting
1352451 and thus you wouldnt be able to hold the central bank responsible
1352452 we must all do our bit to bring inflation down to the target range in the medium term

1352473 unless there is a radical transformation of existing business processes well in advance of any collaborative programme then a project is doomed to failure before it has even started collaboration introduces an entirely new way of working and this has a direct impact on the way people work how they interact with it and how they are trained businesses need to understand all these facets before undertaking a project of this nature user buy in is an absolute pre requisite to success
1352474 it policies also need to be reviewed this must encompass issues such as the appropriate use of email and instant messaging technologies as well as ensuring that the organisation has the capability to archive and monitor all communications
1352475 collaborative solutions should in fact eradicate the need for this sort of communications technology as everything can be captured on the collaboration platform which in turn will support many aups
1352476 collaborative solutions enable individuals and groups to interact in real time and keep a record of whatever they discuss and agree to do increased levels of communication and co operation between your employees partners and customers drives any organisation towards an anytime anywhere culture that delivers tangible business benefits
1352477 start with one technology area and then expand to others alternatively start with one business process and then add in others applying the collaborative technology as and when you assess the success of the initial projects the third option is to start with one business unit or group before large scale roll out

1352494 let me say this ive never been more nervous on the field in my life
1352495 growing up in texas you see those kinds of storms all the time you learn that lightning is nothing to fool around with
1352496 ill stand out there in the rainstorm all day long but thunder and lightning in that kind of proximity its definitely a hazard you have to get the fans out of there we have to be out there but if you give those fans a reason to hang around they will
1352497 if they had continued the game i wouldnt have gone back out there not for a while
1352498 like i said before the inning you have to be an idiot to stand outside during a lightning storm thats just common sense
1352499 when the last one hit it was too close even for us and i pulled them off i would never put any team or player or umpire in harms way
1352500 this time of year with the playoffs and teams in contention we know its tough
1352501 i dont really want to be here at midnight but thats our job thats what you do when the second rain came it just wasnt going to happen we talked to everybody and then called the game
1352502 it was pretty crazy lightning and tornado sirens going off the weather was pretty nuts
1352503 actually it looked like somebody stood above the stadium with a ziplock bag full of water and opened it up it really did you could barely even see right field
1352504 we thought dvds would be the most requested they werent it was books
1352505 despite what many believe books are still popular i think people just still enjoy curling up with a book

1352516 todav a hemos visto estos d as al anterior ministro de justicia hablando de construir nuevas imputaciones para que de juana siguiera en la c rcel pero eso es hacer un flaco favor a la democracia y al estado de derecho
1352517 la democracia y el estado de derecho como m s se fortalecen es con la aplicaci n escrupulosa y rigurosa de la ley y de la normativa vigente en cada momento
1352518 el excarcelamiento de de juana chaos es repugnante y vomitivo
1352519 football engages motivates and inspires but we know it can spill over and get ugly we all have responsibility to deal with these excesses and i sense now there is a dedication from all quarters including the media to do that
1352520 we want prevention rather than sanction and weve given credit to the media for playing a major part in the reduction of simulation
1352521 now we want to see this programme becoming much more than just a campaign and results in making unacceptable behaviour just that unacceptable
1352522 captains must accept a new level of responsibility for the conduct of their teams and work closely with the referee
1352523 if some players go too far we can still recognise the benefits of a quiet word being applied but we also want referees to stand and deal with confrontation not back away some will have to change their mindsets
1352524 it has been difficult to keep referees who have had adverse experiences but we need to tell them they can apply the rules with full fa backing
1352525 we also need to ensure an enjoyable environment for youngsters playing the game they sometimes need to be protected from the influence of overly competitive adults who put too much store in success at that level and provide unnecessary tension
1352526 of course the game must be about competing and winning if possible but not to an over obsession
1352527 now we have a lot of people implementing this new scheme who are good at what they do and it gives me every confidence it will succeed
1352528 of course it is appraisal time at the start of any season fair enough because the game quite rightly has a growing social responsibility
1352529 players are seen as role models and im sure my members accept that some of the things that were seen last season were not too pretty
1352530 we certainly cant take for granted that our game will always automatically attract new supporters
1352531 when we went there we found an astonishing amount of gorillas
1352532 this is the highest known density of gorillas thats ever been found
1352533 we know very little about ebola and how it spreads

1352559 getting serious about gaming impact of video game industry raises concern
1352560 aside from the violence obscenity and negative themes the larger and greater problem lies in the fact that video games control many peoples hearts and minds creating a monotonous zoned out new reality
1352561 god family and friends do not exist in many games

1352601 the problem with vre is that you dont display symptoms so you may have it but the nurse doesnt realise and they touch you then touch another patient without washing their hands
1352602 if vre patients have been sharing a bathroom and its not thoroughly cleaned it can spread rapidly
1352603 once upon a time we use to think that one or two cases was serious
1352604 vre has to be an indication of the cleanliness of wards you have to find and isolate a vre patient fast
1352605 it is not the levels we need to worry about but making sure they are reducing
1352606 if what you read to me is what they have published then it is the report there are so many indictments in the report and the committee has recommended that both the icpc and efcc should further investigate the matter and prosecute those indicted
1352607 i could have given you the report but we have resolved in our meeting not to speak to the press on the matter until it has been laid on the table i am surprise how this report leaked out

1352620 that is such a disgrace ive lost all faith in the system because there are so many athletes who are slipping under the radar
1352621 that is not sport its plain cheating and we need to be vigilant in nailing those who cross the line
1352622 i have got to the point where this is just farcical and simply unfair on the athletes who are clean and get there on their own merit
1352623 it is a joke and again ive lost count of what ive missed out on because of drug cheats
1352624 i was slammed from pillar to the post by the media for not making it past the first round and then i get this news that the girl just in front of me goes positive
1352625 the same thing happened in sydney in 2000 and i missed the olympic final by three hundredths of a second despite one of the girls since returning a positive sample
1352626 in the afternoon when he got home he was a grey green colour staggering and didnt know what day it was
1352627 i tried to keep him in school in sydney but he was so terrified of the noise from trains strangers in the street derelicts
1352628 i had no idea it had happened to him i got home from school and he was in the foetal position in bed with all the lights off going through a major panic attack
1352629 you look at him and he looks like a completely normal boy but he has massive panic attacks and nightmares
1352630 maybe hes a bit softer because hes got a twin sister
1352631 everyone that meets him loves him adults find him very charming hes more comfortable around them than he is around other kids

1352635 i am sending an sms to sonny bill and to khoder too asking them to ring me so i can arrange services
1352636 they added both nasser and toulon to the proceedings on the basis of them having engaged in and inducing sonny bill to break his contract
1352637 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks
1352638 then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab sent by a top u s army scientist at ft detrick without resort to any speculation or inferences at all it is hard to overstate the significance of that fact from the beginning there was a clear intent on the part of the anthrax attacker to create a link between the anthrax attacks and both islamic radicals and the 9 11 attacks
1352639 much more important than the general attempt to link the anthrax to islamic terrorists there was a specific intent indispensably aided by
1352640 that means that abc news four well placed and separate sources fed them information that was completely false
1352641 the same government lab where the anthrax attacks themselves came from was the same place where the false reports originated that blamed those attacks on iraq surely the question of who generated those false iraq anthrax reports is one of the most significant and explosive stories of the last decade

1352649 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1352650 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1352651 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1352652 has merit in terms of just a short term effect on prices
1352653 i offer no suggestion it will make a long term impact on the fact that demand worldwide is going up while supply is flatlined
1352654 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1352655 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1352656 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1352657 id prefer to go to woolies but weve got coles where i live so thats where i go

1352665 in my private practice within the last year or two the stress level of my patients has increased dramatically
1352666 a lot of time it will come down to family stress job issues economic issues people cant make ends meet a lot of marital dysfunction people overworked complaining about bosses i try and help people put these issues into perspective
1352667 it is known that chronic stress stimulates the laying down of extra fat in the abdominal area and has been associated with an increased risk of diabetes heart disease and hypertension
1352668 acute stress mobilizes with adrenaline and then hopefully the body adapts
1352669 but if its left in overdrive because of chronic stressors then the long term effects on biology
1352670 life brings these things and the way i acted was going to show them how to act when something in the future goes bad what they thought of me and how i handled myself in front of them was important
1352671 those runs allowed me to be by myself and to think and rethink and reposition those thoughts it was an opportunity to work out physically but also to put myself together again
1352672 apple is certainly trying but i just dont think given the lack of a qwerty keyboard that youre going to see the iphone supplant the blackberry in terms of usage in the enterprise
1352673 particularly in the bay area thats been at amp ts cross to bear
1352674 its cobbled together a network of cellularone which is terrible and a few others its not the greatest coverage
1352675 youre waiting around and in that time you couldve gotten something done like walk the dog
1352676 obviously for my job and doctors appointments i go out of my way to be on time
1352677 that way his being late equals him being on time
1352678 and heres the simple fact i got here on time and you can manage to as well
1352679 if its a friend who does this a lot and it really puts you out remind them that your time is just as valuable as theirs
1352680 in new york they wait until the agreed meeting time and then they go were more laid back and tolerate more than we probably should
1352681 if were talking about someone who is chronically late they might be avoiding anxiety or anger or resisting something
1352682 perhaps they are overscheduled and need to say no once in a while
1352683 he always taught me its better to be safe than sorry
1352684 if im late for practice it just stresses me out
1352685 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is
1352686 by contrast theres almost no marketing for psychotherapy which has comparable if not better outcomes
1352687 the couch turns out to be an effective 21st century treatment
1352688 dogs in good health with good energy respond quicker than a dog with multiple health issues

1352735 d espite the seemingly powerful narrative that ivins committed suicide because investigators were closing in this is still far from a shut case the fbi needs to explain why it zeroed in on ivins how he could have made the anthrax mailed to lawmakers and the media and how he or anyone else could have pulled off the attacks acting alone i believe this is another mistake in the investigation

1352854 the report is more tittle tattle than based on hard evidence and we are deeply disappointed at the anecdotal nature of the fieldwork and the lack of appreciation of the great strides we have taken
1352855 indeed it ignores the many positive things that the industry is doing to promote social responsibility and the ways in which underage sales and other issues around the responsible serving of alcohol have been tackled

1352860 the national minimum wage should provide a fair deal for workers and employers alike
1352861 the industry has struggled to absorb increased staffing costs for over a decade and any further pay hikes could prove to be the fatal blow for many pub and bar operators

1352865 ive been talking to british beer amp pub association chief executive rob hayward for instance about the number of pubs that are still closing
1352866 i represent a largely rural constituency in a number of rural communities the pub plays a very important part and the laws have had a damaging effect theres no question pubs do complain about the extra burden and costs created by the licensing act
1352867 a lot of claims were made for the act and my experience is that if anything the reverse has happened

1352874 i dont think its a done deal that we know where we are legally as far as minimum pricing is concerned
1352875 its not inconceivable that there could be an exemption under european competition law
1352876 from time to time stories are published of watches agreeing to minimum pricing agreements to prevent drunkenness or possible disorder however these sorts of agreements are against the law and must be avoided as they carry extreme financial penalties
1352877 basically dont go there a minimum pricing agreement is a cartel and its illegal

1352917 we have made every effort to absorb rising costs but the sheer size of increases we have faced in recent months and the fact that we are seeing further rises across virtually every element of our business means that we now reluctantly have to pass on some of these increases to customers
1352918 we are committed to being as efficient a producer as possible in terms of our operating overheads and will continue to focus on cutting costs across the business we are at the same time continuing to invest heavily in our leading portfolio of brands
1352919 however the fact remains that the brewing process is a very heavy user of energy so rises have an immediate impact on the price of producing a pint particularly so given the scale of the increases we have had to cope with this year
1352920 i cannot remember a time when so many major cost increases have come through so consistently across virtually every aspect of our business
1352921 theres got to be a distinct possibility there could be a third increase before the year is out

1352930 as you go around the housing estates of the midlands and the north in particular the scale of the boarding up in blue collar areas is on a considerably greater scale than i remember in 1990 91

1352932 i am concerned about ageing odor and know there are anti ageing odour products but have not bought them myself

1352934 more japanese men are becoming concerned about their smell and so the need for anti body odor products is growing
1352935 its the bastard child of everything weve been striving towards over the 15 20 years that realtime worlds dma and david jones have been making games
1352936 its where we want to go in terms of sandbox gameplay and everything that started with grand theft auto and was evolving through crackdown
1352937 the deal we made for the cars is a full album game download and rock band is the only game title out there putting full albums up as downloadable content
1352938 having said this we would not license the full album out for a similar use
1352939 can and will when the opportunity presents itself license single tracks from this album for other games
1352940 frankly i think that a lot of the intellectual property we create are better than the licenses that doesnt mean there isnt room for great licenses theres room for both
1352941 i think what youre noticing is that in years gone by we havent had as many great original intellectual properties theres a lot more of that this year from ea and i think from here forward
1352942 i think what redeems our industry is quality and i think we take a step back every time we take a license and exploit it with a crappy game thats not what were about
1352943 police called my husband and wanted to talk to him probably about the olympics last time when police came to our home they told us to leave the city during the games we turned down their request and insisted on staying then the police said they would put us under house arrest
1352944 they want me to avoid being interviewed by foreign journalists i told them that what they are doing has violated chinas constitution and wasted taxpayers money i also told them that i am neither a criminal suspect nor a terrorist and that what they are doing has no legal basis the games havent started yet but all kinds of security is now being put in place and it doesnt feel like the friendly atmosphere you would expect at a sporting event
1352945 there are people watching me now they arrived on july 22 they came to have a chat with me in mid july and they came again yesterday the national security bureau told me that they were going to organize me so i asked them what they meant by organizing they didnt give the exact details of what they had in mind but then it became clear that they wanted me to go away to leave beijing and go to a place far away from the olympics venues i said really that they should be ashamed of themselves to say such a thing i asked them on what basis they were saying this they said that because i was connected to the june 4 1989 incident and because i was very active and that i was implicated in hu jias case and so on and so on that i had never cooperated with the authorities to find a harmonious path
1352946 they said if i didnt go that they didnt have enough manpower and therefore would have to take me to a detention center or prison where they could keep an eye on me it would be a lot easier for everyone if i just agreed to leave beijing i would get three meals a day whatever i chose to do but that i absolutely must leave beijing
1352947 the olympics isnt supposed to be a political event but the measures the authorities are taking right now are stricter than after june 4 1989 they are using a lot of the same measures they employed at that time and even more tightly enforced than before the news of a big meeting following the killing of six shanghai police officers had been broadcast overseas and i think they were afraid that a lot of the newly arrived foreign journalists would approach me for interviews and that i would continue to give interviews
1352948 they were already watching me and following me 24 hours a day recently they have had anyone coming to my home sign a register anyone who comes to visit me has to leave their name address telephone number and have their id checked
1352949 i hope that we will get a full report at the national peoples congress after the olympics are over into exactly how much money manpower and resources were devoted to preventing foreign journalists from reporting on china and from blocking off the voices of ordinary chinese people from being heard either by the chinese government or by the international community
1352950 i cant go out any more they called me today to inform me there are four people watching me a public security officer two security guards and a person from the neighborhood committee they told me that if i needed to go out they would take me in their car my work unit told me that this will take effect from july 20 to sept 20

1353021 from each according to their ability to each according to their need
1353022 if we invest in our families and in ordinary americans by helping them go to college with tax cuts for 95 percent of families to reward them for hard work and give tax cuts to help them save for retirement such are the ways everyone can have a stake in our economy
1353023 we americans cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to be ok thats not leadership thats not going to happen

1353029 we have been given permission to use about 1 4 of an acre of a piece of parkland near the nursing home
1353030 it is now a question of clearing the area and preparing the ground for next spring
1353031 we are putting down plastic to prepare the way for the new garden
1353032 i have seen a similar idea in dolphins barn in dublin where a seven acre site was turned into a garden where it was originally planned to build a motorway
1353033 sligo town also has a community garden at the family life centre this would be a garden for everyone in ballymote to enjoy and contribute to
1353034 it would be a place for all of the community to come together and contribute their various skills towards making it a place to cherish
1353035 we hope it will be something the community will take pride as a special part of their own place a garden gives quite a scope for creativity
1353036 we have raised 250 from a disco and are opening a bank account as well
1353037 residents are relieved that the decision taken supports their submission on the proposed development
1353038 we regret the necessity to have had to resort to an bord pleanala on the matter the residents in the area are hopeful that the landowners will consult with them prior to any further planning application to develop the site
1353039 most especially we thank the crew of the coast guard helicopter who arrived just in the nick of time without you we wouldnt be alive to make the following thanks
1353040 daryl deserves an added thanks for towing her springfield lass to browns bay to get her beached for a first inspection to see if shed make it back to rosses point and then rising very early the next morning with andrew henderson and owen carter to tow her back to rosses point after she was pumped out
1353041 thanks too to tom sr tom jr and kyle mccallion for making their boat stingray available to the rnli crew of eithna andrea and john thank you for guiding her to shore and holding her there till we could get there
1353042 many thanks to stephen heraghty from ballyconnel who guided us to browns bay and along with dermot healy arranged for hugh conway to bring his digger to the strand many thanks to hugh conway for many hours of holding fast
1353043 also thanks to freddie parle who donned his diving gear and got the ropes out to springfield lass that got her beached and righted and for taking a look for possible damage to the hull
1353044 a special thanks to crewmember owen mclaughlin for his absolute calmness under fire we are filled with gratitude to each and every one of you god bless you all
1353045 shell be an actress an artist or a writer or perhaps all three
1353046 she loved sligo and its people and was so proud of the sligo shirt on display in our ladys hospital in crumlin
1353047 she had a limp that would come and go and we thought that perhaps she had just injured herself dancing or playing football at first it wasnt painful
1353048 the x rays went to galway and came back clear they couldnt figure out what it was there was a lot of time lost in the early stages
1353049 the care and support that they gave meant that blathnaid got more time at home than most children in the same condition
1353050 he talked of survival but the next day blathnaid woke up in excruciating pain and had relapsed
1353051 one day she asked her granny if she was dying and she replied that we are all dying but we dont know when or where which was a good answer
1353052 she just wanted to make something out of every day such as going out to some of her favourite places around sligo such as half moon bay strandhill or dooney rock
1353053 these allocations build upon the excellent work of previous rounds of the programme and continue to support dedicated community spirit and reward local volunteerism
1353054 i am particularly delighted that strandhill community park ltd has received 70 000 for the development of their facilities i am also grateful to see a grant of 130 000 for cloona cool community park
1353055 councillor mcgarry informed the standards commission that he had sent on the bank statement in august 2007 the standards commission had no record of receiving this
1353056 the donation received by councillor mcgarry which required him to open a political donations account was received after polling day
1353057 legally councillor mcgarry was not required to have disclosed this donation or to have furnished details concerning his political donations account to the standards commission
1353058 the hse had said that roscommon hospital was going to lose its a amp e accident amp emergency and that the surgeons were going to be transferred to portiuncla hospital ballinasloe but deputy finneran came out last week and said that surgeons would be remaining in roscommon
1353059 we dont know yet what he finneran will deliver but it seems that a couple of weeks after the hse announcement about the roscommon surgeons moving to portiuncla that deputy finneran is saying that they wont and that a amp e will be retained in roscommon
1353060 what strikes me is the contrast with what is happening in sligo and what is happening in a next door constituency it is a very similar situation about getting a derogation from a national policy
1353061 we have an excellent centre here the figures for outcomes in sligo stack up with anywhere those figures have been put out there and nobody has contradicted them all the evidence we have so far is that sligo is a centre of excellence
1353062 raising awareness of our services is always at the forefront of everything we do and i was delighted to hear that the club intend to send out some of our literature to all their members
1353063 aimed at reaching out to all sports fans and sports people we started the ball rolling with an ad in the sports pages of the
1353064 previously people might not have expected to find information on samaritans in those pages but we felt that it would reach an audience who might overlook it elsewhere in the paper
1353065 the response to this was both instant and encouraging and we hope to announce details of support received in the coming weeks
1353066 the company spokesperson also referred to the department of transports strategic rail review of 2003 in his comments without realising that the review had not evaluated the sligo derry proposal and in any case was now out of date given rapidly increasing oil prices and the new urgency relating to dealing with climate change
1353067 via a flawed and limited economic appraisal methodology that was widely criticised at the time
1353068 its absurd and irresponsible for a state railway company owned by irish taxpayers including those in the north west to dismiss rail development proposals out of hand when government policy is increasingly focused on dealing with energy efficiency and climate change issues
1353069 this also contradicted cie research into the economics of rail that was published as far back as the 1980s
1353070 an outline proposal for the 700 million extension of the western rail corridor is currently with the department of transport and preliminary data suggested the link through donegal would generate environmental social and economic benefits of 80 million per annum to the region
1353071 would undesirably add to and consolidate commercial development which spoils the rural character of the area
1353072 bring these structures back from near ruin to their former glory

1353086 solzhenitsyn was one of the most important people in the history of russia he wrote exactly what he thought and needed to be remembered
1353087 its a shame that not all young people understand how important he is
1353088 im not the new big anything ive been around for ages and ive been doing all this stuff behind the scenes and i want to put it in the spotlight a bit
1353089 the whole industry is going to have to run hard to stay still in the coming 12 months
1353090 dealing with this is a matter of fairness and common sense
1353091 when we go to a restaurant or to have our haircut and we leave a tip we expect it to go to the staff member in addition to their pay not to be processed through the payroll to make up the minimum wage
1353092 we want to encourage employers to make it clear how tips are distributed so customers know where their money is going and whether or not the establishment operates a fair tipping policy
1353093 under no circumstances do we use tips to top up wages
1353094 the issue of how tips are used has been a thorny one for the trade
1353095 personally i would like to see staff who receive a tip from a customer keep the cash but in practice many pubs and restaurants pool tip money and distribute it evenly among all staff members sometimes according to the hours worked
1353096 many staff actually rely on tips as a supplement to their wages to ensure they take home a decent amount of money the practice of paying people less than the minimum and using tips to make up the shortfall is wholly wrong
1353097 we do not see the need to extend leave for those with children as old as 16
1353098 operation relentless is a prime example of partners working together to help reduce crime and to make licensed venues safer for their customers
1353099 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
1353100 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
1353101 i think this is half baked i dont think were ready for it i dont think the people want it
1353102 i dont know whos going to do it be justice minister because weve not been involved in any discussions on it it appears the alliance havent been properly involved in discussions on it i dont believe the sdlp has
1353103 so how you can announce an agreement without other parties being involved in it escapes me
1353104 a blind one legged monkey could now orchestrate these regular farragoes
1353105 we took these risks and decisions in the name of peace and progress
1353106 northern ireland is crying out for bright young politicians with new ideas and fresh thinking yet how would they ever get a foot on the political ladder when every run of that ladder is occupied by greedy politicians with dual and even triple mandates
1353107 they the dup and sinn fein really ought to consult with us before they spin about us
1353108 i think there is this idea that they can rely on us to ride to the rescue well they can t expect that when they haven t spoken to us on the issue for the last 16 months
1353109 we have been given the job to provide an effective opposition by the electorate and the fact is this is an incoherent and incompetent executive and my party will play no part in that
1353110 the reality is the executive in place has failed to tackle a range of problems from education to rural planning to the irish language and the proposed maze stadium
1353111 and the thought that they need us to take on a department they can t deal with on top of all the others they ve been unable to deal with properly is just bonkers
1353112 he loyally and steadfastly preaches the gospel but he doesnt shove it down our throats we get on well with david
1353113 i have never felt self congratulatory in any way about my involvement because it did precipitate a conflict which eventually claimed 3 500 lives and that is inescapable
1353114 it would be very cruel to say that what we have ended up with is a twilight home in east belfast for retired gunmen but are relations today between the communities really that different
1353115 im just not convinced that the outcome we do have is any better than what we wouldve had had the march not went ahead
1353116 the thought that this would lead to a re emergence of militant irish nationalism which would in turn bring about the resurgence of militant loyalism would simply never even have occurred to us
1353117 what this was about and what it has returned to was equality of citizenship history will record the provisional iras campaign as a continuation of the civil rights movement by inappropriate means
1353118 between the pomposity of bew and the extravagance of mccann i might look like the sane one
1353119 i am confident that together we have a real determination to do something positive for the local trade
1353120 publicans have responded magnificently to our survey and that also speaks volumes about the dreadful daily pressure they are under
1353121 i urge as many publicans as possible to come to our summit meeting at the end of september for which invitations will be sent out shortly
1353122 the standard of dishes was exceptional and it was hard enough choosing the five finalists let alone the overall winner id like to congratulate all of our chefs on some first class recipes and on the passion they have shown for embracing and working with local suppliers
1353123 he cost me a bloody fortune but hes a fantastic horse and is capable of competing at olympic level im calling him andre after pete his competition name is the b cks

1353125 we believe the commercial is exceptional and hits the mark for secret obsession we are anticipating a very successful global launch
1353126 just reinforces our belief in the campaign which has really struck a chord with consumers and in true calvin klein fashion sparks controversy

1353128 some of the friends i had the ones who had the biggest problems were the ones who actually were never allowed to drink anything at home whereas the ones who drink responsibly were the ones who were given a glass of wine or a small glass of beer or a shandy or something
1353129 thats the right way to do it in the home
1353130 when youre a teenager and you go to parties normally there are adults there so that is fine
1353131 i think the idea of saying that we need to create some kind of public space where that happens i think thats quite different
1353132 what was anticipated to be a difficult and challenging year has so far proved to be that and more
1353133 the strategic review is ongoing and is being undertaken at a time when the company has a strong balance sheet
1353134 this program will run constantly for three days in all states and union territories
1353135 the protest is being held against the shameful capitulation of the central government before separatist elements on land allotment to amarnath shrine board
1353136 we need some more time to finalise a common minimum programme as well as the council of ministers
1353137 so we requested the president to give us at least three more days to form a new government on the basis of consensus
1353138 it is becoming necessary to set up new fire stations as large scale multi storeyed buildings and colonies are coming up
1353139 i felt humbled to even be put forward for the obe in the first place so my visit to the palace was an extra special privilege
1353140 the whole day was superb and we were very well looked after
1353141 the monsoon session is scheduled to start on august 11 for which notification was necessary on or before july 28 last two weeks before the session but the government did not make any notification till today sensing that it has no political majority in parliament
1353142 many of the establishments are so pressed for custom that they will do anything to fill their bar mainly selling toxic drinks in devastating quantities to kids who consider a good night out to be one that ends in copious vomiting
1353143 this body bbpa agreed and many publicans said they agreed too that it was a bad idea to offer promotions that depended on patrons scoffing drinks within a limited period of time or based on entry fees that included the reward of allowing people unlimited alcohol
1353144 by flouting their own rules these licensees throughout the country have fouled their own nests and are busy destroying the very pub culture upon which their livelihoods depend
1353145 and im afraid to say the situation is one of circular decline where desperate publicans are as we speak slashing the prices of drinks in an attempt to beat the lack of business in this way skippers scuttle their own ships
1353146 the european style caf culture that new labour fantasises about will never be possible while british publicans demonstrate such utter contempt for responsible drinking and the social rudiments of drinking pleasure
1353147 decent licensees in france would never sell alcopops never mind sell them at minimum prices because they know it would destroy their custom their self respect and ultimately their business
1353148 means that no publican is held to any high standard and no patron either of what it means to be part of a healthy and valuable pub culture
1353149 behaviour lifestyle and social determinants of heart health from research to policy planning programmes and services

1353153 whilst the market is nervous here in wales there is little doubt that our focus on quality production the installation of new vessels and improved cask racking will allow us to compete on favourable terms and build for the future
1353154 ha ha bar amp grill has proven very popular with our customers in our other locations and we think the people of norwich will love it to
1353155 it is a very serious situation we are in talks with our bank to try to borrow the money
1353156 we need the bank to take a long term view
1353157 the bank has got to be a partner with us not just a lender customs have come back to us with a fair deal we have breached some covenants which has put our facilities under review
1353158 but this is a good business turn arounds dont happen that quick we are 17 18 up on the brewing side and the pubs are trading in line with the market they were trading 15 down but have now stabilised
1353159 we hope the bank sees what the team here has created in the past six years
1353160 may cast significant doubt on the groups ability to continue as a going concern
1353161 because consumers are also feeling the pinch in the current climate food operators are having to take a hit on their margins rather than raising prices to mitigate costs
1353162 for many this potentially wipes out profits altogether already we have seen operators particularly pub companies announcing a slowdown in like for like sales
1353163 consumers are reining in their spending often opting for a takeaway rather than a meal out or choosing a cheaper restaurant than they otherwise would we are unlikely to see any uplift in trading for the rest of 2008
1353164 the rise in the cost of labour fuel and other expenses is squeezing margins
1353165 while it is possible to bear this for a short period the extent of the large rise in costs over the past three months indicates that rather than a temporary blip this represents a wholesale drop in profitability
1353166 food commodity prices have grown by 40 over the past year this takes several months to be reflected in the prices paid by foodservice operators so there are still months of prices rises in the pipeline
1353167 the current ban on smoking in public places leaves smokers exposed to the elements of the british winter
1353168 unfair to treat bars and pubs the same as other public places when it comes to smoking as smoking tobacco is something people traditionally do in bars and pubs
1353169 was seen to be the fairest solution whilst also protecting workers and the wider public from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke
1353170 parliament also gave consideration to exposure to the elements of a british winter for those who go outside and smoke
1353171 firstly we wish to thank the four venues who remain vigilant in refusing to serve alcohol to underage children
1353172 however we are very disappointed with the stores that failed underage drinking is heavily liked with anti social behaviour which can be a menace to local residents
1353173 somos v ctimas propicias de una antigua maldici n tenemos que ganar el pan con el propio sudor
1353174 forming close alliances with fellow career politicians who just so happen to have this scandal or that scandal attached to their names
1353175 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
1353176 once again liberals fail to understand the consequences of what this would mean it would mean that the costs of goods at wal mart would rise by a good degree once wal mart is forced to pay employees at a certain salary pay health benefits etc who do you think is going to actually pay for that what about the poor exploited workers at wal mart how can i stand to see them be taken advantage of the simple truth is like most minimal wage employees the vast majority of wal mart employees who would be effected by unionization would be teenagers there are not many middle aged men who support a family of 4 working the cash register at wal mart that is the simple truth
1353177 the drinks they have agreed not to sell are the ones we most often seize from youngsters and so its hoped that by taking them away during the summer holidays well reduce anti social behaviour and underage drinking in the area
1353178 every off licence in benwell agreed to take part and have been positive throughout and i think this demonstrates that they are being responsible and are willing to lose money in order to help improve the situation
1353179 they understand the benefits to themselves and the community and we are here to support them should any issues arise during the initiative by all of us working together including the community we can reduce alcohol related youth disorder in the area

1353239 iran will not give up a single iota of its nuclear rights the countrys president said saturday scornful and smug about an informal deadline to stop expanding uranium enrichment or face more sanctions

1353241 in vienna austria where the iaea is based diplomats said iran faced a sept
1353242 was the headline over an article in the daily telegraph on august 1 2006 reporting
1353243 the un has set today as a final deadline for iran to suspend uranium enrichment
1353244 the guardian reported on february 21 2007 the final deadline right
1353245 the iranians did not give a clear answer if they dont give a clear answer then i think we will have no choice but to begin again to prepare sanctions resolutions for the security council
1353246 ms rice said at the aspen institute in aspen colo but ms rice added that she did not expect the u n security council would prepare sanctions until september ruling out any action in the next few weeks

1353254 we are in administration but we are not closing its mainly to do with our massive expansion plans
1353255 we probably timed it wrong with the current credit crunch weve spent 4m over the past 18 months but it just hasnt worked out for us

1353258 ill be looking to make a purchase or take a stake in a business in the drinks or retail business where branding is a key part of the proposition
1353259 as predicted the smoking ban and reduced levels of consumer confidence have had a significant impact on the short term trading position of the business
1353260 our retail division is also suffering from a historic lack of investment but positive returns are being made from our investment in pub refurbishments and cains brands are increasing their presence nationally
1353261 i had dinner on the beach with a crush and there were lights on the palm trees then went walking on the beach and after that we slow danced wait it gets better while we were slow dancing my crush and i had our first kiss and after it i leaned back and i said you cheated and he said why and i said i dont kiss on the first date then he said well i never really play by the rules i was waiting for a a director to say cut i was like are we shooting this right now

1353263 the bottles were being sold at full price months ago but they were no longer on sale
1353264 two or three cases or 36 bottles were later found behind the bar and were sold off at the cheap price but they were limited to one per person and only offered to regular customers
1353265 as with any pub operator we constantly review our estate to maximise the potential of our pubs one of our key strengths is that we have the ability to make sure that we have the right pub in the right place operating under the best model
1353266 as part of business as usual we have identified circa 50 pubs to transfer from our managed to leased estates
1353267 driving when under the influence of any substance is dangerous to the driver themselves along with their passengers people in other cars and pedestrians we should not tolerate this type of behaviour
1353268 drivers need to act responsibly at all times campaigns like this reinforce the message that drinking and getting behind the wheel of a car is unacceptable
1353269 beer sales are on the slide and the tax increase in the budget has made it worse
1353270 this is hitting britains brewers and pubs hard its also creating a large hole in the chancellors pocket with the treasurys tax take also down
1353271 this must call into question the governments planned beer tax escalator wheres the logic in taxing more when youre taking less
1353272 with around one million jobs reliant on the trade the loss of 1 6m pints a day is having a serious impact not just on the sector itself but on the uk economy as a whole
1353273 beer sales in pubs are now at their lowest level since the great depression of the 1930s down seven million pints a day from the height of the market in 1979
1353274 were trying to manage a faltering economy falling consumer spending and escalating costs on everything from raw materials to fuel the last thing we need is another tax increase
1353275 we need a change of approach from the government brewing is a major industry beer our national drink and pubs a treasured part of our national culture
1353276 yet with further duty increases planned the treasury continues to see the brewing industry as a cash cow to be milked in future budgets these falling tax revenues show that its time for a rethink
1353277 it is unfortunate that the identified methodological flaws in the original specification for the project were not corrected
1353278 they have resulted in figures that significantly misrepresent the true scale of product that is sold in the uk market that carries unit and other labelling information
1353279 it is also particularly disappointing that the media and others have been briefed on what is erroneous information and the industrys reputation tarnished as a consequence
1353280 we believe that our consistent policy of achieving a sustainable rent for each pub is contributing to our resilient performance
1353281 although the market is difficult and we do not expect any improvement in the economy in the short term we are still seeing growth in eating out in marstons pubs despite the squeeze on discretionary expenditure and weaker confidence
1353282 we are also experiencing volume growth in the excellent range of marstons premium ales
1353283 cost inflation remains a significant challenge but we are controlling our costs well and are taking appropriate actions to offset some of the increases in the costs of brewing raw materials food supplies and utilities
1353284 negative thinking do you do that and you dont even know it
1353285 under senator mccains plan the oil companies get billions more we dont pay any less at the pump and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis
1353286 the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1353287 the new plan is really just a lot of words warmed over
1353288 its easy to try to hide behind the words but the reality is barack obama is not leading on this issue

1353295 the acceptance with which god receives us into his favor as righteous men
1353296 since god justifies us by the intercession of christ he absolves us not by the confirmation of our own innocence but by the imputation of righteousness so that we who are not righteous in ourselves may be reckoned as such in christ
1353297 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ

1353336 whilst spouses may have the skills experience or qualifications to make them the most appropriate candidate for work in their partners parliamentary or constituency office this is less likely to apply to mps children whether under 18 or young adults
1353337 furthermore recent incidents involving the employment by mps of their children demonstrate clearly the negative impact this has on public confidence in members
1353338 the proposal is therefore that mps children should no longer be able to gain paid employment in their parents constituency or parliamentary offices or in any other role relating to the parents work as an mp

1353376 the pro shariah local taliban are sons of the soil they are not separatists and are the upholders of the integrity of pakistan they may be ultra conservatives but when they call for the shariah implementation they are in line with the nations constitution which visualises an islamic pakistan some people like rehman malik and others who share the formers perception are raising hell that they would not let the shariah call prevail for in their perception it will be against the government writ a state as they frantically argue cannot afford to have two kinds of law and administration
1353377 right now in fata the federation has lost friends those who side with the federation are killed by dubious elements thus it will be good politics if pro state tehrik i taliban pakistan is embraced by the gilani administration for seven obvious reasons
1353378 one it will be a step towards restoring the government writ two it will bring much needed peace three it will bring order to a chaotic situation where the colonial set up has already collapsed for its sadistic approach to people and their problems inefficiency and insensitivity four once the local taliban are recognised as the rightful representatives of their people in their region of influence they will be able to chase out miscreants from their jurisdiction five they can also go after the blood of the agents provocateurs and indian recruits engaged in sabotage and fomenting scare in society six the taliban can also negotiate neutralisation of the presence of foreign elements if due inquiry proves their presence seven it will strengthen pakistan as a nation and a state
1353379 from all counts the fata situation is manageable it offers challenge as well as hope islam can heal wounds give courage and help build a nation that yearns for islams remedial power the call for the shariah is not a laughable joke if the ppp administration and the establishment that supports it did not read the situation correctly it may devastate our nation today it is the call for the shariah in fata tomorrow its sympathy wave can embrace the whole nation the colonial world and its manifestations in pakistan are in the death throes the nation cannot continue with its stink for long the fata call is a wake up call

1353430 oh he did put a bit of ointment here and there and i did ask him about the level of dicks attention in particular the needles he said if i was stupid enough to enjoy all was ok even those long needles he did add that i should not do it very often though
1353431 so you didnt charge because he did not use your body
1353432 yes he used my body the kinky bastard it is a shame i dont tell you what he gets up to patient doctor confidentiality you would enjoy it we had planned for him to pierce my nipples for me but before you get interested he didnt after dick used them so well earlier i telephoned the doc who agreed that it may curtail that sort of treatment
1353433 my beautiful girl is talking to me but she is not telling me what she actually is dying to tell me come on out with it
1353434 alright than i have had him pierce me down there before i show you i will talk through my thinking having decided i did want something done first i ruled out the inner or outer lips can look sluttish and either get in the way or even pull when
1353435 that left the clit or the hood i understand that there is a risk of losing sensitivity going into the clit no way is that a possibility for the new chantal what is called a vertical clitoral hood sounded good and is a possibility if i have any more which is not very likely
1353436 the doc has been checking up on one called the triangle where the clit is pulled away from the body and a horizontal pierce made behind the clit but not interfering with its nerves this one stimulates the back of the clit giving even more pleasure to the owner
1353437 more sexual pleasure is presumably what you went for although i do not see that it is possible for you to get more stimulated you will have steam coming out of your ears
1353438 see it sits out the way for normal day to day wear but as soon as i get any action on my clit it will be pressing down on the jewellery and it does look rather nice well
1353439 the main drawback is that my week off will not be long enough for it to
1353440 my beautiful girl i think we better go to bed and you have a long rest i will try and not wake you in the morning
1353441 i cannot understand the difference in my body these days a few weeks ago a few slaps on the ass had me bruised and aching for a week now dick and the doc put my body through idiotic torture and a few hours later although i have several aches and glowing bits nothing very painful
1353442 dont be silly i loved it thank you so much for a superb session i hope you enjoyed it a least as much as i did
1353443 i am absolutely fine the doctor even checked me over last night and he added some decoration to my body you will like
1353444 dont worry he even said the long needles were fine in moderation look if i give you his cell phone number i am sure he will enjoy a chat you can exchange notes
1353445 perhaps you can clear any new sadistic ideas with him first rather than worrying about things like two long needles being too much for me
1353446 no i wasnt criticising everything was just right and of coarse we have an appointment in four weeks time
1353447 i really should not but if you take it easy certainly not a proper session but ok two weeks yesterday
1353448 the ceiling is not very high but i see what you mean i can probably get that fixed
1353449 you enjoyed that so much four weeks is too long to wait you are insane
1353450 by christ i feel as randy as hell come on home and use my ass
1353451 my piercing in the tongue was to give others pleasure but my new one was for me and it really does do just that i must not work until monday we insist the girls have all the week off but im dying to start back i will have to limit action to ass and mouth for another week in fact i might let dick be the to try my steel enhanced pussy next sunday
1353452 hey you think too much of dick you have lots of other customers to satisfy as well
1353453 yes i do have lots of other customers there are so many requests coming in for appointments with me that i am not going to work the line at weekends unless it gets really busy
1353454 i am going to take appointments tuesdays thru saturday have mondays free and reserve sundays for specials from a supply and demand point of view i will have to charge 500 and 750 for the basic that may cause some of them to move on to the other girls
1353455 this is a first you are talking about limiting your sexual pleasure although i note that you are spreading the gratification over the whole week
1353456 only limiting for practical reasons i have already got bookings averaging about six a day for the coming week and bear in mind they are all for my ass
1353457 this piercing is almost too good it keeps reminding me of how much i enjoy being used very frustrating this week it increases the sensation of anal enormously i cant imagine what it will feel like with pressure on the top of my clit at the same time
1353458 ohh god what have i done you said that if i got anymore satisfaction from my clit i would have smoke coming out of my ears the doc had to check on his work and i dont know about smoke my ears must have been flaming like the afterburners on a fighter jet
1353459 he did say it was healing extremely well as far as her could tell but he said i had better not use my pussy until next sunday
1353460 there you go dreaming of dick again did the doctor prescribe a strong tranquilizer to keep you sane
1353461 you split everything you earn 50 50 with me so i think it is fair that i do the same i am going to get that money grabber of a lawyer in town to draw up a partnership agreement with us owning the ranch on a 50 50 basis
1353462 so in away i will get 75 of my earnings is that to encourage me to work even harder
1353463 which would you prefer i can give your lovely cock some action with my mouth now or perhaps you would like a little show and than mouth and ass
1353464 i have let things get out of hand this week while my mind and body appreciate the action it is unnecessary for me to work every day the excitement dull for both you and i with that sort of routine and we have plenty of girls that can make my customers just as happy as i can
1353465 you are sounding sensible my love but i should say that we have girls that make our customers nearly as happy as you can
1353466 i could be conceited and agree but it is not really true although i am in the top half dozen anyway i am definitely going back to working on just two nights a week thursday and friday but keeping my options open for specials on other days
1353467 are you sure you can manage to keep your resolve you have yet to experience the full effect of your clit stimulation from your new with normal sex
1353468 that is what made me have these thoughts it already adds to my response even during anal and the doc showed me the effect it can have on monday if i do not limit myself i think i may truly become addicted which i do not want i have made a mental contract with myself that says the two days only except for specials i have already got several booking for the coming week which i will obviously honour
1353469 for the moment there is only g5 and intel builds i have a g4 laptop but im having problems getting firefox to successfully build on it so that may take a few days believe me g4 builds will come once i get these issues worked out

1353694 demand for diesel is rising in the u s and europe and its price has been shooting up much faster than that of petrol gasoline
1353695 most crude when refined produces diesel and petrol the lighter the crude the bigger the share of diesel refinery upgrades to get more diesel from heavier crudes could take two years to relieve the pinch
1353696 until then refiners dont want to produce more diesel from cheaper heavier crude because that would mean producing more petrol sales of which have dropped
1353697 the u s could also ease the diesel squeeze by adjusting the federal requirement that 9 billion gallons of ethanol be blended with us petrol supplies this year
1353698 the ethanol mandate is reducing the amount of petrol used and so are petrol prices in excess of 4 a gallon the side effect of less petrol use is less production of diesel and more pressure on crude oil prices
1353699 easing the ethanol mandate would also slow the increase in food prices ethanol a biofuel is made mostly from corn the cost of which has also been soaring
1353700 europe for example has become a large importer of the fuel while the u s has become a significant exporter for the first time in years traders report that the united states will export perhaps 400 000 barrels per day to europe in july a year ago no diesel exports were going from the u s to europe
1353701 the concept of empiricism is very important in my way of working with photography i come up with a theory about how a certain matter must be and then i use a kind of reverse science to make this theory come true i make archives of hundreds of images and then start editing down the material until it confirms my theory this method of working leads to extensive series of images to gather evidence in support of a certain viewpoint is a central point in my work for example the theory behind the series woodland was very simple that there is no system behind natures design unless you wish for it be i went into the woods in search for images that would dispel the notion of systematic design in nature the result was a series of high contrast images of dense woodland like line drawings a riot of branches and harsh sunlight with machina nbsp i continued on the theme of order and disorder this time not in nature but in the stainless steel jungle of a nanotechnological research laboratory my idea was that as something grows more complex it also moves closer to chaos logic turns to anarchy when theres too much of it the scenes from machina are in a way similar to the ones from woodland in that the trees have the metallic appearance of machines and the laboratory equipment has a very organic structure

1353734 with most cameras today we feel that iso 100 400 defines our comfort zone this means we use this range without any further thought with the canon rebel xs 1000d we can risk iso 800 or 1600 more often than not
1353735 low light performance was very good shots taken at iso 1600 were sharp and colour accurate with only a hint of visible colour noise this was eliminated with the high iso noise reduction setting long exposure noise reduction produced minimal image softening
1353736 the great performance results i achieved from the camera coupled with canons notorious ease of use means the eos 1000d is perfect for its target audience
1353737 for us the 64mm 2 5 inch lcd screen feels poky and the simplicity of the control layout makes the cheerfully oversized buttons and the screen feel adrift in wasted real estate on the cameras back theres one control wheel which means altering aperture involves holding down a button and turning the wheel simultaneously were not keen on this but its par for the course in this section of the market
1353738 canons new eos 1000d rebel xs is a modest upgrade over its predecessor and in terms of af points an actual downgrade but canon knows new budget dslr buyers greatly value the presence of image stabilisation and live view both of which are now crucially offered here and unlike nikon it also means canon now offers live view on all its consumer dslrs this could be a trend were seeing on budget dslrs where canon like nikon and sony have both added new features while taking away or reducing the functionality of others at least the mirror lockup and depth of field previews on the 1000d xs remain though
1353739 the buttons are large and easy to press each is labeled clearly and for those used to canons interface navigating the buttons on the eos 1000d shouldnt pose a problem like the eos 450d the menu and playback button have been shifted from the left to the top of the lcd
1353740 its clear that canon has found itself in a situation where they are lacking a model at the low end of the digital slr market while the 450d has allowed canon to come on leaps and bounds in what it offers an increase in features and tech has meant the 450d has become a mid level entry level camera rather than an entry level entry level model
1353741 the 1000d is designed to fit into canons model range beneath the 450d which explains much of why the 450d was such a step up from its predecessor the 400d in many respects the 1000d is still a step up from that model with remarkably few compromises made to keep the costs down

1353753 we are concerned that at a time when tbi is recognized as the signature wound of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan one of the most widely accepted and critical rehabilitative treatments for this injury known as cognitive rehabilitation therapy is excluded by the militarys tricare health insurance program
1353754 given the prevalence of tbi among returning service personnel it is difficult to comprehend why the militarys managed healthcare plan does not cover the very therapies that give our soldiers the best opportunities to recover and live full and productive lives
1353755 his remarkable recovery from a severe tbi has been widely cited as a powerful example of the great innovations of our military healthcare system
1353756 yet the treatment made available to mr woodruff may be denied to u s military personnel who are similarly afflicted
1353757 wounded warriors need and deserve unfettered access to this vital treatment
1353758 since brain injuries compromise physical emotional and cognitive abilities it is unethical not to treat all three domains
1353759 the human intellect is our most precious resource once the brain is injured we should spare no resources to facilitate the brains cognitive recovery
1353760 with great numbers of soldiers returning home with brain injuries we must provide a full continuum of care
1353761 the best way we can honor the life of sgt gerald cassidy is by taking steps to ensure that we never again fail our heroes returning home from battle
1353762 no soldiers who have been wounded in service for this country should have their care compromised or delayed when they return home we cannot bring sgt cassidy back but we can honor his sacrifice by resolving to do better by our men and women in uniform
1353763 with hundreds of thousands of service members returning home from iraq and afghanistan suffering from traumatic brain injuries we must ensure these heroes have access to the best care and treatment available
1353764 these combat related injuries require immediate and regular rehabilitation in order to help these service members live independent and healthy lives its deeply concerning that one of the most accepted treatments for tbi cognitive rehabilitation therapy is not covered under the militarys health insurance program i call on secretary gates to immediately address this alarming lack of coverage and provide our service members with the care they deserve

1353849 obamas better looking than mccain obamas more stylish than mccain obamas more fit than mccain he refers to better music than mccain
1353850 mccain that guys not cool i just cant call mccain cool
1353851 hes younger i think he has more of a connection with my generation i just think he communicates better to my generation especially with issues in iraq mccain is all right but not as cool as obama
1353852 what obamas been able to do is capitalize on his hipness at least as far as younger voters go
1353853 i think its not that they dont support his issues and his policies but younger voters are more willing to work for him and work passionately for him because hes someone who resonates more on their wavelength
1353854 look at hell be cool til the day he dies but for him and for ron paul or anybody whos elderly and whos cool part of it is what they represent that makes them that
1353855 the most important thing in terms of reaching youth is not being cool its being authentic or true to who you are
1353856 i think hed look ridiculous if he tried to purposefully seem younger than he is if he started doing extreme sports or something ridiculous
1353857 has a very conservative image and that doesnt really help him either
1353858 shes not the type like obamas wife who can get down and dirty with younger people and really relate to them
1353859 its not a popularity contest hes running for leader of the free world
1353860 i am going to lead our nation to energy independence and im going to do it with a realistic and comprehensive all of the above approach that uses every resource available to finally solve this crisis
1353861 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1353862 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1353863 without a doubt this addiction is one of the most urgent threats weve ever faced
1353864 our understanding with the us was good throughout and it never came to acrimony but they are the biggest subsidisers in the world in terms of what affects us so we will have to see them in court
1353865 i dont have any problem if they want to offer a partial deal that puts a cap on their subsidies
1353866 but countries want the power to say no to some things in order to get what they want i dont think partial deals work in a system like the wto
1353867 this was in slow motion and now it will be accelerated
1353868 its quite possible that thursday will be the last day that rififi will be open it seems that the owner of rififi has come to an impasse with the landlord as you might have known rififi has been occupying the space on a month by month basis since march and the landlord is now asking for substantially more money its possible that hes playing hardball but if an agreement isnt be reached by thursday then it will really be the last day that rififi is open im sorry we didnt have a couple of weeks to plan for this but the relationship between the landlord and the owner has always been somewhat unstable so it was hard to predict if and when the end would actually come please be assured that all of the time and effort you put into producing your show has been greatly appreciated if there is any change in the situation i will let you know as soon as i hear about it
1353869 weve spent a trillion or so dollars 30 000 dead or wounded a large loss in international influence and prestige all for the sake of disarming a country with no wmds
1353870 my concern right from the beginning was that the war wouldnt be worth the effort it would require and that the american people dont have a good record in supporting long costly struggles in developing countries
1353871 no cameras no reporters and we all know why senator mccain doesnt want to be seen hat in hand with the president whose failed policies he promises to continue for another four years
1353872 w e did not find that raines knew that the companys accounting practices departed from gaap in significant ways
1353873 surrender is not an option defending america at the united nations
1353874 the islamic revolutionary guards corps has recently tested a naval weapon with a 300 km range in which no vessel would be safe and would be sent to the depths
1353875 enemies know that we are easily able to block the strait of hormuz for unlimited period
1353876 the strait and vessels are in range of our various weapons
1353877 in view of the proximity of the strait of hormuz to our shores this distance is within the range of an assortment of weapons and its closure for us is very feasible and we face no limitations from the point of view of time
1353878 people in at least 14 villages will be adversely affected by the construction including the vibration and noise from the explosions and the release of chemical substances in natural water sources and soil pianporn said
1353879 i do not understand why prime minister samak wanted to dust off the water diversion project despite the fact that it has yet to be approved by the national environmental committee first pianporn added
1353880 who will benefit from the proposed water diversion projects are they the people or the politicians said lertsak
1353881 peoples participation in any decision making is also required for such megaprojects as it could have an immense impact on their lives
1353882 making gujarat water secure needs multiple approaches and rwh is the safest and least expensive option relying solely on mega projects like sardar sarovar project and the proposed kalpasar would be a mistake water security needs a bottom up vision and community leadership to make every drop count
1353883 overexploitation of upstream water and future climatic changes pose grave risks to river water supply mega water projects operating on the supply side could become stranded assets
1353884 mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1353885 our economy is in turmoil i dont have to tell the people of youngstown
1353886 people here have known some hard knocks and hard times
1353887 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1353888 we already have enough kitchenware to fill several new york city sized kitchens
1353889 give a gift that will last a lifetime our memories of a fabulous honeymoon
1353890 the pangolins were packed and ready for export to china via seaports in sumatra and java
1353891 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1353892 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1353893 it is quite spectacular we are just wiping out primates
1353894 the problem with these species is that they have long lives so it takes time to reverse the decline it is quite depressing
1353895 this creates access allowing people to go to places that they could not go in the past
1353896 primates are relatively easy to hunt because they are diurnal live in groups and are noisy they are really easy targets
1353897 many of the asian primates like langurs are 5 10kg so they are a good target generally you find that what is big and easy to get disappears very quickly
1353898 if you kill seven 10 or 20 mountain gorillas it has a devastating impact on the entire population
1353899 within the red list criteria you are allowed to anticipate what will happen in the future as well as look at what has happened in the past
1353900 so it was decided not to change the mountain gorillas listing because of the sudden deaths and we do not know when it is going to stop
1353901 the lion tamarins were almost extinct in the wild but they were very popular in zoos so there was a large captive population
1353902 so zoos around the world decided to join forces to introduce a captive breeding programme to reintroduce the tamarins in brazil
1353903 they were not exposed to eagles or snakes and they did not know how to find food so a lot of them died but some did survive and slowly the numbers began to increase
1353904 it took time money and effort at all levels from the politicians to scientists and volunteers on the ground for just two species
1353905 when we went there we found an astonishing amount of gorillas
1353906 this is the highest known density of gorillas thats ever been found
1353907 we know very little about ebola and how it spreads
1353908 we dont even know the animal that spreads it around
1353909 i would suggest that a minority of people had hidden them with the intention of causing harm to police officers and possibly to the horses or dogs we are using on patrol
1353910 to link a stash of knives allegedly found somewhere in the hoo peninsula in kent to the camp for climate action is nothing but a smear campaign against us
1353911 to suggest that the campers environmentalists living at a camp serving only vegan food would even consider hurting a police horse shows the polices press release to be nothing but political policing
1353912 this in no way justifies the way the police are treating the camp
1353913 it is disgraceful to suggest that the campers have criminal intent
1353914 this is obviously an attempt by the police to distract us from raising issues about climate change
1353915 we hope to sign mou memorandum of understanding with indonesia such agreement will encourage a policy of palm based biofuel that both countries can use
1353916 it is very important and there are many other subjects that we can work together

1353920 over and above the 750m already pledged was accorded during talks after meeting karzai in the indian capital new delhi on monday

1353928 this is especially helpful for new teachers but could also benefit experienced ones who notice students faltering or not responding well on certain topics
1353929 as teachers we always benefit from feedback but often our administrators are not science certified and cant really help on subject specific matters
1353930 the quantum mentors will provide teachers with unlimited access to training where they can work at their own pace
1353931 the ability to stay ahead of the class and have the urgently needed tools to prepare lesson materials will be a time saving resource and excellent confidence builder for new and out of field teachers
1353932 jesus said that we are to render to god the things that are gods and to caesar those that are caesars our caesar is a government of the people by the people and for the people in order for us to render to caesar the things that are due him we should indeed participate in our government our lord would have it so
1353933 if you aspire to anything beyond that youre not going to live there any more and thats the choice you make
1353934 some of these are vocational things like nurses its accepted they go into it knowing that thats part of the deal
1353935 many people like teachers dont do things for the pay but you wont find a teacher that works as hard as we do

1353938 the residents are so angry and have said they will put poison around the plantation areas to kill the elephants unless officials take quick action
1353939 im afraid that another attack on their plantations will push villagers to launch their plan
1353940 people here eagerly planted palm oil as it brings more profits but its all been easily destroyed by elephants
1353941 if you are contacted directly by the inspector generals office or the government accountability office requesting information of any kind please do not respond to questions or make any statements
1353942 if it were easy it wouldnt be realistic because these are not easy issues
1353943 i was just struck by the enormity of the challenge before us
1353944 the notion of large reductions from the chinese perspective seems absolutely undoable
1353945 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1353946 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction

1354040 there was a slight safety risk for women wearing normal bras with metal parts underneath a bullet proof vest
1354041 if the vest is hit by a projectile this can have an impact on the metal bit in the bra underneath and cause injuries
1354042 i suppose ive always grown up around the idea of starting a shop in order to start a scene
1354043 its just a word thats used to describe the enemy you know who they dont want you to like today but maybe those same people they wanted you to like yesterday
1354044 both of my parents names are a lot to live up to
1354045 shes been down to this store and she loved it
1354046 essentially at the root of all thats where i come from where she comes from its the idea that you lead a much more interesting life when you dress up
1354047 i wasnt particularly enamoured with calling it terrorist at first but after a couple of days of rationalising i kind of understood it

1354058 how to create a casus belli between tehran and washington
1354059 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war
1354060 the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up
1354061 in order to provoke an attack which could then be used to justify material breach
1354062 the most extraordinary exchange takes place when lt gen michael delong bemoans shrinking political support for neo con war plans on capitol hill and suggests that sympathy for the bush administrations agenda will only be achieved after a new terror attack
1354063 rumsfeld agrees that the psychological impact of 9 11 is wearing off and the behavior pattern of citizens in both the u s and europe suggests that they are unconcerned about the threat of terror
1354064 so i can understand the argument for not writing something that was rejected uh maybe my attitude always towards editors is theyre mice training to be rats but the point is jejune if you know what that means

1354163 the government has to pay some attention there is a need to take feedback and after studying the success of this campaign the government should distribute a plant to every individual of the state from next year which will keep the environment clean and the dream of becoming a herbal state will also get fulfilled the launching of such campaign by the government is going to us benefit us definitely

1354171 saya ingin bicara dengan anda boleh saya duduk di sini
1354172 anda yang melukis the final doomsday pada pameran kami yang terakhir kan
1354173 the final doomsday mendapat apresiasi luar biasa dari pengamat seni dan mahasiswa lain dari sana kami berpendapat bahwa anda punya potensi luar biasa untuk menjadi pelukis romantisme
1354174 tapi saya tidak tertarik bergabung dengan klub seni anda dan juga tidak tertarik untuk menjadikan melukis sebagai pekerjaan tetap
1354175 kami ingin menawari anda untuk ikut dalam pameran lukisan bertemakan romantisme yang diselenggarakan kementerian pemberdayaan perempuan akhir tahun ini
1354176 ketika kami menerima undangannya kami langsung terpikir untuk menawari anda ikut serta dan mewakili pelita buana
1354177 saya hanya ingin tahu apakah klub seni tidak punya pelukis romantisme sehingga harus mengundang orang dari luar klub
1354178 saya hanya melukis jika saya mau dan saya melukis berdasarkan perasaan saya jadi saya nggak butuh role model seperti gusti
1354179 saya hanya minta kalian tidak mengganggu saya selama proses melukis sampai lukisan tersebut rampung kalian hanya tinggal menyediakan media lukisnya saja dan saya akan ambil bagian dalam pameran ini bagaimana
1354180 ini semua keperluan anda untuk menyelesaikan lukisan anda nona sabrina
1354181 semua pameran punya tema masing masing yang harus dipatuhi peserta kan
1354182 pokoknya melukiskan wanita dari berbagai sudut pandang oleh karena itu mungkin gusti meminta chloe sebagai modelnya
1354183 bisakah kalian tidak mengganggu saya sama sekali saya akan menyerahkan lukisan itu pada kalian tepat tanggal 1 desember nanti bagaimana
1354184 saya akan melukis sesuai gaya saya dan karena itulah kalian meminta saya ikut kan
1354185 dan juga karena lukisan ini terlalu indah untuk sebuah lukisan cat minyak biasa
1354186 kamu pasti punya alasan kenapa kamu selalu menampilkan rona gelap dalam tiap lukisan kamu
1354187 tempo hari the final doomsday menampilkan naluri ketakutan yang kuat dan kamu mencoba menimbulkan perasaan tersiksa di lukisan kali ini kamu bahkan nggak punya role model kan jadi semua ketakutan dan ketersiksaan ini berasal dari dalam diri kamu sendiri dan kamu mencoba mengeluarkan perasaan itu dalam setiap lukisan kamu kamu seolah ingin memberitahu dunia perasaan traumatis yang kamu rasakan di saat kamu mungkin nggak punya tempat untuk mengadu
1354188 saya sudah bergelut dengan lukisan semenjak saya kecil dan tebakan saya benar kan
1354189 kabar baiknya trauma itu justru sekarang mengental dan jadi ciri khas kamu
1354190 saya tau kamu pernah mengadakan pameran lukisan pribadi pada saat usia kamu sembilan tahun dan bahkan pernah menjadi dirigen orkestra pada saat berusia enam tahun darah seni kamu terlalu kental sayangnya semakin dewasa kamu jadi semakin meronakan ketakutan itu sehingga semua seni yang berasal dari tangan kamu menjadi kental dengan rona traumatis itu
1354191 menurut saya chloe cuma prototipe gadis cantik yang selama ini didefinisikan masyarakat
1354192 orang membentuk prototipe cantik lewat berbagai kontes kecantikan chloe hanya satu bentukan prototipe itu ia menjadi stereotipe orang cantik seperti yang diinginkan orang orang
1354193 menurut saya pengertian cantik dikembalikan pada siapa yang menilainya karena sebagian besar nilai di dunia ini bersifat subyektif
1354194 saya diutus oleh pelita buana ke sini saya mewakili pelita buana dan saya hanya ingin mengabadikan wanita tercantik di pelita buana dalam lukisan saya itulah alasan kenapa saya memilih chloe
1354195 kalau saya boleh memilih saya tentu lebih memilih kamu yang jadi model saya
1354196 sepertinya saya emang nggak pernah bisa sembunyiin sesuatu dari kamu ya
1354197 ya udah besok saya tunggu di kantin fakultas teknik jam sebelas
1354198 saya ada kuliah lagi jam satu sampe sore besok kamu mau kita ngobrol banyak kan
1354199 saya nungguin kamu selama satu setengah jam dan harus terima penjelasan kamu saya nggak punya banyak waktu gus dan saya nggak bisa mentolerir keterlambatan siapapun
1354200 saya harus menyiapkan segala hal yang berhubungan dengan pameran pribadi saya yang pertama di indonesia
1354201 kamu kan udah janji ama saya dan kamu nggak membatalkan janji itu at least kasih saya kabar kek sms kek
1354202 kamu udah bikin saya kecewa hari ini dan saya nggak tertarik pada apapun yang berhubungan ama kamu setelah hari ini
1354203 dari pamerannya gusti ini kan hari terakhir pamerannya denger denger loe akrab ama gusti akhir akhir ini ya
1354204 pamerannya rame lho lukisannya keren keren semua gue sih nggak bisa menafsirkan lukisan tapi gue rasa kalo loe kesana pasti loe menikmati banget deh loe sama gusti satu aliran kan

1354463 wir m ssen tats chlich abwarten was in hessen passiert
1354464 angenommen die spd in hessen beschlie t sich von der linkspartei nicht nur tolerieren zu lassen sondern auch eine koalition mit ihr einzugehen soll da nicht ein gefestigtes und berzeugtes spd mitglied sagen d rfen unter diesen umst nden kann ich die nicht w hlen
1354465 damals waren wir in einer extremen oppositionspolitik die nicht mehr vereinbar war mit der entwicklung der welt nach godesberg stand die neue konomische grundorientierung fest
1354466 darum bin ich auf der seite von wolfgang clement der auch k nftig sagen will wenn es in einzelnen bundesl ndern koalitionen mit den linken gibt werde ich die partei diesmal nicht w hlen
1354467 aber es ist f r die spd voraussetzung f r eine konstruktive entwicklung weil wir unseren weg in einer vollkommen ver nderten globalen welt erst noch finden m ssen
1354468 es ist schwer eine sozialdemokratische mehrheit zustande zu bringen aber das darf eben auch nicht das endg ltige ziel sein das ziel muss vielmehr sein die partei als volkspartei auf eine grundlage zu stellen die unter den kommenden schwierigen wirtschaftlichen bedingungen bestand hat
1354469 er hat den versuch unternommen der partei eine zerrei probe zu ersparen indem er viele kompromisse eingegangen ist ich pers nlich meine die spd braucht eine zerrei probe eine mit positivem ergebnis die partei braucht klare formulierungen und keine weiteren versuche bei allem immer alle einzubinden

1354596 our health care system today continues to rely on largely inadequate technology including the traditional stress test that only shows danger signs when the arteries are obstructed by 70 percent or more
1354597 a successful cardiac stress test can actually give patients a false sense of security it doesnt mean you dont have heart disease and it doesnt mean you cant walk out of that test and weeks days or even hours later drop dead from a heart attack

1354605 i am delighted to join the board and work with esps strong management team to further develop and grow the business
1354606 the north dakota law is far ahead of any other state corporation law in providing rights for stockholders
1354607 it addresses each of the major issues in corporate governance
1354608 its an intriguing idea and someone was bound to do it sooner or later
1354609 it will be interesting to see how it plays out in terms of shareholder approval
1354610 i would think any shareholder who understands the benefits of the north dakota law would support this proposal
1354611 ultimately it comes down to the judiciary and the view is that the delaware judiciary is investor protective
1354612 there is no corporate judiciary in north dakota dedicated to the resolution of corporate disputes
1354613 my preference as an investor would be to make sure the law is clear rather than having to run to the courts to establish my rights
1354614 the delaware judiciary is limited by the statute in the rights it can provide investors theres no way for example that the delaware judiciary could create a right of proxy access which north dakota has
1354615 while a corporation has wide latitude for the actions it takes thats based on the premise that directors are agents of shareholders
1354616 the corollary is that shareholders should be able to structure the procedures for nominating and electing directors
1354617 has generally limited the ability of shareholders pursuing special interests to recover their solicitation expenses
1354618 have a strong basis to reaffirm the traditional prerogatives of the board under delaware law to manage the business of the corporation and decide how to spend its funds
1354619 were pleased to see that citigroup is fulfilling the commitment it made to investors earlier this year and look forward to working with the new board leadership
1354620 what we really need is new blood on the board that will expand strategic vision for the future of the company that includes focus on the core business
1354621 i think that its valuable for members of the committees to get some sense of what the other committees are doing
1354622 while the stock price has been dropping in large part because of the mounting subprime losses we contend that much of the current depression of the stock price reflects investor confusion over citigroups sprawling makeup
1354623 the shareholders of a delaware corporation have the right to participate in selecting the contestants for election to the board the shareholders are entitled to facilitate the exercise of that right by proposing a bylaw that would encourage candidates other than board sponsored nominees to stand for election
1354624 does not go far enough because the bylaw contains no language or provision that would reserve to cas directors their full power to exercise their fiduciary duty to decide whether or not it would be appropriate in a specific case to award reimbursement at all
1354625 this decision makes delaware less relevant to future discussions about shareholder rights and makes a federal solution the only alternative for shareholders seeking fair and open elections
1354626 the ball is pushed back to the sec for when the next chairman will finally have to resolve shareowner rights to proxy access
1354627 although many will likely view this as a loss for stockholders i believe they should view the case as a significant win yes the director reimbursement bylaw was held invalid but the court held that the election process was a proper subject for stockholder action a bylaw mandating the inclusion of stockholder nominees on the companys proxy statement should fare much better under a ca analysis
1354628 should doom any substantive component to a poison pill redemption bylaw such as a requirement that directors not adopt or renew any pill that could be in place longer than a year
1354629 increasing investor votes coupled with consumer interest in such issues as climate change makes a perfect storm of pressures that result in companies responding positively to reasonably framed shareholder resolutions
1354630 we think valeo is worth four times more than its current stock price
1354631 having active shareholders willing to get involved in the management of the company stabilizes the capital of french listed companies
1354632 m anagers had become used to running companies without being accountable active shareholders break that habit
1354633 it is impossible for us to effect the change we see as possible if we dont change the board
1354634 the hired hands who manage csx railroad should be given their walking papers
1354635 if csx had devoted more attention to running its railroad as efficiently as other railroads do they wouldnt be in the position theyre in
1354636 they could be charities and university endowments but they could also be foreign governments sovereign wealth funds
1354637 not saying thank you very much when we offered the board seats was unreasonable
1354638 this is very much cutting edge best practice in corporate governance
1354639 management doesnt want its actions to be scrutinized by a better informed board
1354640 in our view the conclusion is not changed by the presence of economic or business incentives that the counterparty may have to vote the shares as the other party wishes
1354641 to justify their actions on the basis of formalistic legal arguments even when it is apparent that they have defeated the purpose of the law
1354642 consider these violations and the patterns of deceptive conduct from the tci group including false testimony under oath as you evaluate whether the tci group nominees are fit to serve on the board of a u s public company
1354643 simply put the bear market mauled the 2008 proxy season
1354644 the collapse of bear stearns on the eve of the season let most of the air out of the shareholder activism balloon
1354645 people are focusing on whether there is going to be a tomorrow in the market and not on these traditional governance issues
1354646 some institutions may believe given the trauma of the marketplace that management shouldnt be distracted by these concerns
1354647 boards have gotten a lot better at opening a dialogue with investors and that may be having an effect
1354648 unprecedented outreach effort to solicit votes from institutional and retail investors
1354649 what shareholders were looking for was responsiveness from directors and in those cases they gave them a break
1354650 when investors seemed to be incensed by pay there was a reaction
1354651 at merrill and citi there was new management so shareholders gave them the benefit of the doubt
1354652 its hard to imagine not having say on pay in some form given that it exists in england
1354653 while many public and labor funds appeared reluctant to rock a sinking ship hedge fund activists were only too happy to raise the jolly roger

1354677 patients wishing for revision or secondary surgeries can be most challenging to a cosmetic surgeon because often times these patients are dissatisfied angry and doubtful
1354678 what happened the first time in most cases is that the patient and doctor did not clearly express their expectations prior to the surgery the doctor doing the revision surgery has to make sure that same mistake doesnt happen the second time around
1354679 the patient must also keep in mind that some results are completely unattainable especially those who seek cosmetic surgery as a quick fix to alter their appearance or want to have multiple procedures done at once need to be educated on the risks on the other hand doctors have to push ego aside and realize that he or she may not be able to fix everything and relay that honestly to the patient

1354690 in seeking to fulfill our vision of healthy communities were bringing our close knit network of physicians together to share clinical and financial information on one allscripts network
1354691 we planned to take this step eventually but the stark rule change provided us the opportunity to move forward in a much more aggressive manner and to build physician support for the deployment over a much shorter time
1354692 we are pleased that evangelical community hospital is able to support the deployment of the allscripts electronic health record to our staff members who might not otherwise adopt and use an electronic health record either because of cost or fear of implementation difficulties
1354693 we carefully evaluated multiple vendors and believe that allscripts offers the best combination of functionality and support it is clear that the use of an electronic health record will enhance patient safety and the quality of care delivered by these physicians
1354694 the connectivity to other community physicians that allscripts will provide is especially important
1354695 it means that patients being seen by multiple providers or going to the emergency room may be confident that all their physicians have access to the same information including medical history test results medication lists and allergies this will allow provision of more timely safer care and avoid duplication of tests and procedures
1354696 a big challenge that we face is that a large number of college students in the area have no medical history on file at the hospital
1354697 also elderly patients who often have multiple health issues and are on numerous medications are brought to the emergency department for care we want to diagnose and treat these and all patients in the most efficient and effective manner possible ihealth clearly gives us the ability to deliver quality care for them by making it easier for our providers to quickly locate vital clinical information
1354698 having spent four years in the susquehanna valley im pleased that allscripts will be helping to keep the local population healthier and i applaud evangelical community hospital for their commitment to developing an end to end community care model ensuring that physicians throughout the community have the information they need when and where they need it to improve the quality of care they deliver and ultimately lower the cost of running a medical practice
1354699 the introduction of these new programs helps address evolving online threats and provides more practical guidance to assess and manage risk
1354700 in the race between exploit and protection microsoft is committed to shifting the advantage to the security industry the microsoft active protections program gives security software providers the information and resources they need to help better protect customers
1354701 as security threats become more sophisticated the global security community must combine its resources and work together to provide maximum security protections to worldwide internet users
1354702 no one organization can counter online attacks alone therefore we must use the combined strength of the industry partners customers and public organizations to build a more secure environment for everyone
1354703 the fast increase of price and ocean freight has threatened the smooth development of chinas steel and iron industry what should we do to solve this problem we should make long term countermeasures at present the best method is to control the amount of ore import thus to control the fast increase of steel and iron
1354704 gastric bypass patients work very hard to manage their weight and adjust their lifestyle after surgery
1354705 sometimes through no fault of their own or their surgeon the benefits of the bypass procedure are not permanent
1354706 to date revision options have been expensive difficult to perform and risky for the patient effectively leaving them without any treatment options now with this new incisionless procedure being offered at bluegrass bariatric we have a new and dramatically less invasive way to correct a key cause of weight regain
1354707 by eliminating skin incisions this new procedure may provide important advantages to patients including reduced risk of infection and associated complications less post operative pain faster recovery time and no abdominal scars
1354708 my original gastric bypass procedure was the best thing id ever done for myself i lost 99 pounds and really felt great but then the weight gradually started coming back
1354709 i was so thrilled to hear that there was an incisionless procedure that could help me
1354710 i left the hospital after the rose procedure and only felt a little ache in my shoulder which went away after i took one pain pill i immediately felt fuller faster during meals and have already lost 24 pounds

1354719 i know that it will be difficult but most do
1354720 of course i want to win a spot on the first team but i figure id most likely go to the farm or juniors this depends strictly on the club
1354721 i have gradually gotten into it i think it is most apparent to stay on the spot

1354940 means for wasting peoples time especially that of the elite and means for stealing money
1354941 i made him kill his brother and bury him under earth till he disappeared
1354942 i whispered to him you son of the old man save the treasuries to win you are one of the greatest men
1354943 i told him you are the greatest one in the palace
1354944 what did you say to the one who drinks wine
1354945 i told him you should drink this grapes juice it is the answer to all your problems it wipes out your troubles and dont worry you know the way to repentance and its doors are always open for you

1354948 o allah show us the tuth as truth amp give us the ability to follow it amp show us the falsehood as falsehood amp give us the ability to avoid it
1354949 the prophet saws visited his mother s grave and wept and everyone there wept with him saws then the prophet saws said i sought my lord s permission to seek forgiveness for her but he did not permit me i then sought permission to visit her grave and he permitted me to visit her grave
1354950 o my father why worship that which hears not and see not and can profit thee nothing 43 o my father to me hath come knowledge which has not reached thee so follow me i will guide thee to a way that is even and straight 44 o my father serve not the shaytaan for the shaytan is a rebel against allah most gracious 45 o my father i fear lest a penalty afflict thee from allah most gracious so that thou become to the shaytaan a friend
1354951 dost thou hate my gods o ibraheem if thou forbear not i will indeed stone thee now get away from me for a good long while
1354952 peace be on thee i will pray to my lord for thy forgiveness for he is to me most gracious
1354953 o my son embark with us and be not with the disbelievers
1354954 i will be take myself to some mountain it will save me from the water
1354955 this day nothing can save from the command of allah any but those on whom he has mercy

1354962 displayed extraordinary effort and showed a firm commitment to lead the team which will be responsible for attacking the targets that we have agreed to destroy
1354963 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media
1354964 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from the cia ever involved in any such effort
1354965 the cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous

1354971 the rain started coming down they started covering the field and about 10 minutes later they asked us to move towards cover and then we started hearing the tornado sirens go off
1354972 it was pretty cramped down there the whole terminal was down there

1354993 the aversion to long term and deeply committed study of science among american students also stems from other cultural imperatives
1354994 the antiscience agenda is visible as early as kindergarten with its infantile versions of the diversity agenda and its early budding of self esteem lessons but it complicates and propagates all the way up through grade school and high school in college it often drops the mask of diffuse benevolence and hardens into a fascination with identity

1355010 tudo quanto o pai tem meu por isso vos disse que h de receber do que meu e vo lo h de anunciar
1355011 jesus falou assim e levantando seus olhos ao c u disse pai chegada a hora glorifica a teu filho para que tamb m o teu filho te glorifique a ti
1355012 pai justo o mundo n o te conheceu mas eu te conheci e estes conheceram que tu me enviaste a mim
1355013 porque n o recebestes o esp rito de escravid o para outra vez estardes em temor mas recebestes o esp rito de ado o de filhos pelo qual clamamos aba pai
1355014 e eu serei para v s pai e v s sereis para mim filhos e filhas diz o senhor todo poderoso

1355084 the increased acceptance of greener vehicles such as hybrid and electric vehicles is to be encouraged they have an important role in improving fuel economy and reducing emissions our advanced external sound synthesis technology increases pedestrian safety while retaining the cars environmental benefits we hope that legislators introduce minimum noise requirements for vehicles to encourage the adoption of technologies such as ours which will ultimately increase pedestrian safety
1355085 blind and partially sighted people use the noise of oncoming traffic as a cue for when it is safe to cross a road if a quiet hybrid electric vehicle is approaching then they will no longer have this cue and are immediately put at risk
1355086 as the leading voice on transport and mobility issues in the visual impairment sector guide dogs believes further research and development is needed to address the issues of identifying quiet vehicles for blind and partially sighted people the charity recognises the environmental benefits of these vehicles however more consideration needs to be given to the safety implications to visually impaired pedestrians
1355087 road safety professionals teach children that they can improve their safety by listening for traffic and the sound of an approaching vehicle is a warning that most pedestrians will use before making the decision to cross the road new electric engines make vehicles much quieter so we need to look at ways of ensuring the safety of pedestrians we welcome innovative solutions which address this

1355255 while others have linked agent orange to cancers such as soft tissue sarcomas hodgkins disease and lymphoma there is limited evidence so far associating it with prostate cancer
1355256 here we report on the largest study to date of vietnam war veterans exposed to agent orange and the incidence of prostate cancer
1355257 our countrys veterans deserve the best possible health care and this study clearly confirms that agent orange exposure during service in vietnam is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer later in life
1355258 just as those with a family history of prostate cancer or who are of african american heritage are screened more frequently so too should men with agent orange exposure be given priority consideration for all the screening and diagnostic tools we have at our disposal in the hopes of early detection and treatment of this disease
1355259 with this consortium the field of psychiatry has come together in a way that is unprecedented
1355260 with the understanding that no individual study has enough power to ask these incredibly important questions
1355261 the consortium should be recognized for taking the important first step towards unearthing the full underlying genomic architecture of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
1355262 only by doing such a large study could we have uncovered these stunning findings to such a high degree of confidence thus setting the stage for an even more complete understanding of the full genomic contributions to disease
1355263 in this second generation of medical genetics we can use new genomic technologies to look at thousands of patients at a much finer resolution than ever before
1355264 it is encouraging that both research teams identified these same genomic sites
1355265 in light of these new findings there no longer needs to be an argument that this type of variation plays a role in some of the risk
1355266 the task now is to understand how rare structural variation together with other kinds of genetic variation and environmental effects work together to produce schizophrenia
1355267 this wonderful framework has enabled the development of new tools and made them rapidly available
1355268 plink is not only crucial to our studies of psychiatric genetics but because it and other analysis tools are made publicly available they are becoming the international standard for whole genome studies
1355269 just observing one of these events in a patient does not in itself tell you anything about the role of that particular variant in causing that persons disease
1355270 we now have a strong foothold into the genetic architecture of this psychiatric disease
1355271 after over a year of negotiations i am pleased to announce an historic coalition supporting legislation to make health insurance more affordable for the 47 1 million workers in our nations small businesses and the 14 1 million self employed persons
1355272 contrary to popular belief most people who dont have insurance are not out of work in fact they work full time in small businesses that cannot afford health insurance for their workers small business owners across america are trying to do their part to help provide their employees with health insurance but they are struggling with annual double digit premium increases this bill helps solve that problem
1355273 we commend this bipartisan group of senators for supporting small business and working to address their no 1 concern the ever increasing cost of healthcare
1355274 the pooling options and tax credits outlined in this bill directly reflect on nfibs small business principles for healthcare reform helping to stabilize costs and incentivizing small businesses we will continue to work with leaders in congress to pursue new approaches to addressing the healthcare crisis that continues to burden americas job creators
1355275 for many realtors and those with families the total cost of health insurance can rival or even exceed their monthly mortgage
1355276 this bill will empower trade associations and other organizations to help guide their self employed and small business members through the process of finding coverage
1355277 the ilmb is aware of the issues on lake windermere and is working with the regional district of east kootenay rdek including the district of invermere to address many of the issues you raise
1355278 the rdek has requested a moratorium on land act applications on the foreshore of lake windermere and we expect a similar request from invermere
1355279 the moratorium would allow the local government to complete planning including zoning on the lake to manage future foreshore development
1355280 no decision will be made until we hear from the applicant and from invermere
1355281 first the town and other government agencies are undergoing a process of appropriately managing lake windermere

1355357 today s newspapers invest in their web sites out of vanity and from an inability to get their heads out of the geographically defined markets of the past they have a local paper so they assume they need a local site bull developing and maintaining a web site is expensive and reduces the funds available to support the journalism and community building
1355358 if you think you need sql and html people on full time staff then you re probably not understanding what it will take it succeed in the future
1355359 heck an online paper isn t much more than a complicated blogger com if google can provide free hosting to the citizen journalists who are making life difficult for the newspapers google should be able to host the newspapers for free as well the idea would be to have each newsroom focus on whatever it does best and then link them all together into a larger whole which is greater than the sum of the parts
1355360 get out of the manufacturing and distribution and technology businesses as soon as possible turn off the press outsource the computers outsource the copyediting to india or to the readers collaborate with the reporting public and then ask what you really are the answer matters dearly
1355361 we have decided that having separate newsrooms has reached the end we have gotten as much out of it as we can we need to be in one building so we can learn what the other does no decision has been made but i think there is an agreement that we need to be together somewhere we have not talked about where we have talked conceptually about it

1355364 i think the dry bulk shippers as a group should outperform as long as globalization and demand for commodities continues but the better ones like tbs international dryships genco shipping and eagle bulk shipping especially so
1355365 if we look at the themes that have been driving the c dollar during the last couple of weeks now number one is that weve seen a fairly substantial weakening in commodity prices especially crude oil
1355366 the market is paying a little more attention to that because the last few corrections in crude oil have been very short term and fairly shallow
1355367 more protracted in terms of time and a lot larger in terms of the magnitude of the corrections
1355368 were starting to see economies in the u k europe and japan for example start to exhibit weakness
1355369 people are beginning to get worried we are going to see reduced demand for commodities which obviously filters back into negative sentiment for the c dollar

1355420 abbywinters com has always been tremendously supportive of asacp first as a member then as a corporate sponsor and last year they upgraded to title sponsor
1355421 in addition to supporting asacp financially they continue to champion efforts to protect children from viewing age inappropriate material on an international level through their use of the restricted to adults rta website label quite simply asacp could not carry out its mission without the support of dedicated sponsors like abbywinters com

1355541 despite my intimate understanding of the mind set that requires such careful attention to who is in and who is out i am still somehow taken by surprise each time i am confronted with my old schools inability to treat me like any other graduate i have tried in my own imperfect way to live up to values that the school taught me expressing my respect and love for the wisdom of the tradition while trying to reconcile jewish faith with scholarship and engagement in the public sphere as a result i have not felt myself to have rejected my upbringing even when some others imagine me to have done so by virtue of my marriage in the sense of shared history and formation i remain of the community even while no longer fully in the community
1355542 the reason for the resistance to such marriages derives from jewish law but also from the challenge of defining the borders of the modern orthodox community in the liberal modern state it is defined not so much by what people believe or say they believe it is much safer not to ask as by what they do

1355554 unattended by meat the palate not distracted by unrelated sauces their purity and fragrance is thrown into relief the course is an automatic relaxation point in a meal perhaps more attractive to many modern day gourmets than the archaic mid menu sherbet or the somewhat barbaric

1355571 i do not expect great things from an eventual meeting but it is evident that there will be a thaw in bilateral relations
1355572 i believe that turkey is an important player in the caucasus balkans and the middle east as turkey has more influence armenia is more and more isolated
1355573 moreover as turkeys negotiation process with the european union advances economic and cultural relations will improve with armenia
1355574 even if the president is willing for progress it will be negotiated behind the scenes and made public at the last minute
1355575 this is propaganda by armenian because it is turkey that brings conditions

1355599 the case is very strong that teaching elementary middle school and high school students to use a repertoire of comprehension strategies increases their comprehension of text teachers should model and explain comprehension strategies have their students practice using such strategies with teacher support and let students know they are expected to continue using the strategies when reading on their own such teaching should occur across every school day for as long as required to get all readers using the strategies independently which means including it in reading instruction for years

1355620 the classic goal of catechesis was to inform the understanding of the
1355621 who have been rebuked by the church or forced out of their church related positions for their criticism of the policies of pope john paul ii as well as more mainstream catholics who share the same outlook
1355622 catechesis is generally conceded to be a dismal failure today survey after
1355623 the catechetical collapse of the past 35 years has not been an isolated phenomenon one of the most prominent partisans in the campaign that produced the new catechetics fr berard marthaler cheerfully concedes that it has had a symbiotic relationship with biblical scholarship the liturgical movement and the new theology
1355624 thus in what was supposed to be an age of lay empowerment the dre and her
1355625 much talk was heard about the signs of the times but the new experts
1355626 at the high school level the new religious education seldom involved
1355627 nor is this crisis past even now widely used catechetical texts embody a
1355628 john cardinal wright and his congregation for the clergy were seriously embarrassed by a series of resolutions passed by the english speaking language group at the congress
1355629 clear your minds of theological smog your hearts of induced sociological confusion so that you may recapture joy in the lord
1355630 to make sure he doesnt fall on his face in much more
1355631 well maybe but there are those of us who believe that professionalism despite all its virtue can ruin religion more quickly than sin at least if the sinners have contrite and humble hearts
1355632 expressed the wish that revelation should not be diluted or drowned out in a catechesis which is centered on speculative or psychological side issues catechesis should not propose immature theological opinion or even more serious theological opinions that are contrary to the faith
1355633 a heavy heart with tears lucker told a group of educators in
1355634 years of confusion and diversity in catechetical instruction material have left an entire generation in a state of ambiguity
1355635 confusion of voices making it all the more difficult to
1355636 the book states its material is drawn from human experience written
1355637 this is a tired repetition of a narrowly understood view of human
1355638 this is a flattened landscape where the experience of god from the great
1355639 does this mean thats the source of the doctrine well the pope came up
1355640 where does the teaching about birth control fit into this discussion
1355641 some say birth control is a definitive teaching others that it is an
1355642 so obviously it becomes a power issue a patriarchal issue and a political issue when the people in rome want to have a theological discussion on a particular topic they will bring in theologians from around the world but theyre all hand picked so they all say the same thing theyll say we consulted broadly on this issue and this is what we hear but really theyre only listening to one side of the question we give great weight to officially held positions and we arrive at them as i described before through listening to the theologians having free and open discussion of these questions and listening to the people
1355643 what i need from you josh is a little more urgency its not going to be like that in a game you are too casual you are too casual for me
1355644 no i dont joey galloway is still not ready to go b j askew is still not ready to go ill say jeff garcia and jovan haye are making progress but theyre still not ready to go charles bennett left practice with some heat and hydration problems i believe hell be ok other than that i really dont have any other updates antonio bryant made his return today and was somewhat limited but he gutted it out its a credit to him
1355645 well luke mccown had both of them we dont get out here early every day all year and get center quarterback exchanges for any other reason thats the no 1 fundamental in this game at this point in time its ridiculous
1355646 i saw some improvement the guys are practicing hard its very competitive every time the defense stuffs the offense you want to be mad if youre an offensive coach when we get a big explosive play offensively you want to be mad if youre a defensive coach but when you go back to your room to look at the tape theres some very good things that we can build off of
1355647 im doing well its a grind putting together the scripts putting together the rotations what we worked on today we worked on the four minute drill where the offense has a lead and youve got to make a first down running the ball normally to close out the football game we were successful once and unsuccessful another time we worked on the last three plays of the game in desperation with our backup players that could possibly be in that role against the dolphins you try to be creative to stimulate your players and also challenge them its been fun in some regard its also been a lot of late nights and early mornings you get a little tired but im going to live when im alive and sleep when im dead as bon jovi says
1355648 he looks good he runs effortlessly hes making the effort to become a more reliable blocker hes a rare target throwing the football to him hes got great receiving ability and we like the things hes doing
1355649 warrick looks good to me warrick is picking it up he understands the offense hes more comfortable hes moving very quick and instinctively and im really impressed with warrick dunn
1355650 he can watch and be a spectator at this point hopefully in the next 48 hours hell be able to get back on the practice field in some capacity whether it be in a walkthrough or in individual work hes not far away but these injuries youve got to be careful with you dont want to have a setback hes making real good progress
1355651 well hand out a game plan so to speak were not really specifically looking at the dolphin defense theyre going to run a 3 4 defense theyve got a new defensive staff there were going to try to continue to challenge our players learning our offense and well put together and introduce the miami dolphins to our players so our players are familiar with their personnel and their scheme but were not going to spend countless hours game planning for the regular season we never do
1355652 i see a lot of what i saw last year in the second half of the season i see a guy that not only can rush the passer and has speed to get the corner but hes also becoming a much more complete player were running the ball left in our 9 on 7 drills more than we ever had just to try to get him ready for the regular season and obviously we want to try to become a better running team left and right inside and out hes a more complete player and hes got great upside
1355653 no hell we have so many quarterbacks i collect them so were going to have to figure out what to do well have a starter and well try to get as many guys in the game as we can but well make that assessment here in the next couple days and well go from there
1355654 hes a pro bowl quarterback that had a very good offseason hes in tremendous shape except for his calf so i feel good about garcia i really feel good with the way brian griese is moving this football team right now hes making a lot of throws really good decisions and hes handling the no huddle offense extremely well i like the flash that luke mccown has hes got some real flash playmaking ability weve just got to harness it a little bit better weve got to do a bit better job coaching
1355655 i didnt see much of the game last night obviously we had meetings ourselves but hall of fame weekend is more than just a preseason football game the introduction of emmitt thomas art monk darrell green gary zimmerman andre tippett what a great great weekend
1355656 obviously this is a different training camp than weve experienced weve been going indoors for the most part in the afternoon well have three or four guys normally get ivs in the morning but we havent had any in the afternoon our training staff todd toriscelli was at the university of miami down there hes on the cutting edge of dealing with the heat hydrating our players and taking care of them the cool down tent halfway through practice is a real good way to cool the body temperature also

1355688 molson brands that are marketed and sold in the us by coors brewing company have been declining in recent years
1355689 most recently increases in packaging and freight costs on imported products combined with continued volume declines have significantly impacted the overall profitability of the brands in the us
1355690 while management continues to believe that the molson brands play an important role in the millercoors brand portfolio it was determined that the value of the intangible brand asset has been impaired the company therefore recognised a 50 6m non cash charge in the second quarter to reduce the carrying value of the molson brands in the us
1355691 across our company our top brands continue to outperform the industry in the second quarter and we achieved net pricing gains and substantial cost savings in each of our core markets
1355692 at the same time however energy and commodity inflation has become a bigger challenge for our company and for the global beer industry this cost inflation combined with our higher tax rate drove lower after tax income for our total company in the quarter

1355729 it should be a pretty good group as long as the coaching doesnt screw it up
1355730 he has an environment that if hes going to take off this is a great place for him
1355731 hes really big and really fast and really talented if he can gain consistency and stay with us well stay with him we have a chance for a great marriage
1355732 we have a lot of potential to do a lot of things
1355733 we cant fall into the trap of just banking on talent its all about work we have to keep working to get better
1355734 if they can avoid the distraction of the brett favre situation they can go pretty far if jeff garcia stays healthy

1355738 jeremy is a guy i want to play my entire career next to
1355739 now you have five guys who are smart young and talented we have the makings of a good offensive line

1355741 so far my biggest challenges have been speaking a different language and being away from my family
1355742 once i begin my service one of the challenges will be integrating into a new community in a foreign country and facilitating youth and families programs that address the needs of the host community
1355743 the application process alone was 11 months my parents consider this the opportunity of a lifetime and are very excited for me
1355744 the absolute professionalism and overwhelming support i received from the staff at the sheriffs office was indescribable the uwf criminal justice program faculty coordinated the communication between me and the sheriffs office and it was an amazing feeling to receive such support from uwf
1355745 my advice is to set a goal and simply do it
1355746 graduation was exciting and terrifying for me i was happy to receive my degree but scared of what the future held i gave the peace corps a lot of thought and after a year of working in the social work field i applied and now i want to do it more than ever
1355747 approximately 50 percent of military participating in off duty education choose online learning courses due to their temporary duty deployments or just the need to have flexibility and portability as some days are 12 hour days while others may be shorter
1355748 our student support system is what makes uwf stand out among other colleges and universities
1355749 students have questions today and are deploying tomorrow we offer them immediate assistance to take care of whatever they need so they can complete their courses
1355750 many military service members choose uwf because it offers an online program that provides them with the flexibility and convenience to start at one place and still continue their education despite being called to duty
1355751 they truly appreciate that they can create a schedule that works for them
1355752 we have spent the past eight months conducting research and development on arabic language and culture

1355754 i am disappointed and it was a surprise because this is a player who has played in the champions league and been in the argentina squad for the olympic games you have managers talking about how good he is so i think the system needs to change greece asking about him when you have eight or 10 teams asking about a player and hes not playing it means that he is good he has a long contract and i think he can impress and next year will be a different situation
1355755 when it comes to ethics and showing that you have a real concern for ethical issues then what you do is make a check from your campaign organization that is sitting on as we all know that is sitting on a lot of money which came from these sources and give it away give it to charity
1355756 his failure to do so i think shows that he just doesnt get it when it comes to some of these ethical issues

1355769 ive had so many positive experiences being a part time specialist and i hesitate to even write about the positive things that ive experienced because i dont want to step on any toes by blogging about work all that to say i went in as a part time specialist being pretty skeptical of the retail world granted i love apple computers and have had both the hardware and software enrich and make my life easier for years but i wrongly assumed that just because it was a retail company that it would be similar to my other prior retail experiences and my hang ups with commercialism in general i was wrong apple has been amazing and the culture you become a part of when you use an apple computer is only that much stronger when you become a part of the growing family who work for the company

1355777 while others have linked agent orange to cancers such as soft tissue sarcomas hodgkins disease and lymphoma there is limited evidence so far associating it with prostate cancer
1355778 here we report on the largest study to date of vietnam war veterans exposed to agent orange and the incidence of prostate cancer
1355779 our countrys veterans deserve the best possible health care and this study clearly confirms that agent orange exposure during service in vietnam is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer later in life
1355780 just as those with a family history of prostate cancer or who are of african american heritage are screened more frequently so too should men with agent orange exposure be given priority consideration for all the screening and diagnostic tools we have at our disposal in the hopes of early detection and treatment of this disease
1355781 only now can we see the whole stage play no longer just the opening scene and the curtain call
1355782 endometriosis occurs when cells of the inner lining of the womb are found growing outside of the uterus
1355783 we found the telomere a region at the end of all chromosomes that prevents the chromosome destroying itself during cell division is abnormally long in women with endometriosis
1355784 our research shows however that cells in the lining of the womb are unique in that they can express this enzyme in the early stages of the menstrual cycle when cell division is important but not during the latter stages when implantation of the fertilised embryo becomes a priority
1355785 women who have endometriosis express this enzyme in both the early and late stages of the menstrual cycle which means that the cells will continue to divide and lose their focus in supporting the establishment of a pregnancy as a result the lining of the womb may be more hostile to an early pregnancy and the cells that are shed at this late stage in the menstrual cycle may be more aggressive and more able to survive and implant outside the uterus causing pain in the pelvic or abdomen area
1355786 until now the only option for transplant patients has been to take a cocktail of drugs for the rest of their lives
1355787 these drugs can cause severe side effects and cannot always prevent the slow destructive process of chronic rejection which often leads to the failure of the transplanted organ
1355788 that is why our use of transplant acceptance inducing cells taics in kidney transplant patients is such an exciting development as it could eventually offer patients who have had transplant surgery a much higher quality of life free from complex drug regimes
1355789 although our use of taics is still in the preliminary stages the results of our clinical trials on 17 kidney transplant patients are promising
1355790 we concluded that although the stage one trial showed that taic therapy was both safe and clinically practicable the trial was unable to provide evidence that postoperative taic administration has a beneficial effect
1355791 although our stage two clinical trial did not provide conclusive evidence of a beneficial effect of pre operative taics treatment the results were encouraging
1355792 they suggest that taics promote a physical state that might allow us to minimise the drugs we use to stop the patients immune system from rejecting their new organ
1355793 our research clearly shows that infusing taics into patients before they have a kidney transplant or after the procedure has been carried out is a practical and safe clinical option
1355794 although this procedure is still being developed and refined it poses an exciting possibility for clinicians and patients alike

1355799 how to use the internet to advertise promote and market your business or website with little or no money
1355800 at least one proposal has surfaced that would charge users by the byte after a certain amount of data has been transmitted during a given period
1355801 this is a kind of volume cap which i do not find to be a very useful practice given an arbitrary amount of time one can transfer arbitrarily large amounts of information
1355802 rather than a volume cap i suggest the introduction of transmission rate caps which would allow users to purchase access to the internet at a given minimum data rate and be free to transfer data at at least up to that rate in any way they wish
1355803 in my view internet traffic should be managed with an eye towards applications and protocols
1355804 for example a broadband provider should be able to prioritise packets that call for low latency the period of time it takes for a packet to travel from point a to point b but such prioritisation should be applied across the board to all low latency traffic not just particular application providers
1355805 broadband carriers should not be in the business of picking winners and losers in the market under the rubric of network management
1355806 network management should be narrowly tailored with bandwidth constraints aimed essentially at times of actual congestion
1355807 in the middle of the night available capacity may be entirely sufficient and thus moderating users traffic may be unnecessary

1355878 there have been incidents where clinicians have not reported where they have witnessed harm to a patient as a result of another surgeon conducting his or her work
1355879 we cannot allow these circumstances to keep going on where doctors witness harm serious harm on some occasions and not have it reported
1355880 you read the report and its almost a complete replication of what happened in bundaberg
1355881 and the really terrifying part is its still the same attempt by the bureaucracy to say its not our fault lets blame the doctors
1355882 but queensland health are to blame and the only change ive seen is that the bureaucrats are now smarter about how they get back at whistleblowers
1355883 they the commission do make the observation that the changes made would have gone a long way to stop this thing that happened in mackay from occurring again

1355900 it was like a little finger then now it is like a thumb
1355901 tibetan buddhism has five major sects though dalai represents the gelupa or the yellow sect all sects were following dalai before he had fled after that he has ceased to be a religious authority he is regarded as a political activist now
1355902 dalai lama is welcome only if he supports the policy of central government but it seems till now he has no intention of doing so
1355903 violence is not only illegal it goes against the teachings of buddhism
1355904 tibet is an integral part of china dalai lama should respect this historical fact and unity of the country
1355905 we heard huge shouts at around 12 pm while the children were in their classes and then saw burning torches being thrown over the wall and onto the roof of the school building
1355906 we closed the gates and sheltered the frightened children into a safe area in the school
1355907 indiscriminate violence to create a sense of terror and chaos
1355908 tibet is developing faster than ever it has brought changes in interests and correlation of forces too at present the very important task is modernization and the harmonious scientific sustainable development though the march 14 incidents were minor in nature the central government should be more vigilant about the development of tibet
1355909 before the democratic reforms they had the ruling role in older system they owned more than one third of the productive forces they had cultural political and judicial dominance also after the democratic reforms they lost many of the privileges serfs and peasants were liberated that caused some kind of discontent among monks particularly among living buddhas chairman mao had once remarked jocularly that the monks produce neither goods nor descendants they only consume
1355910 chairman mao urged dalai lama to lead the democratic reforms which he could not do modernization is not only needed for china it is needed for tibet too few monks may be still nostalgic for the old days they are far far away from modernization
1355911 dalai does not want the stability and development of tibet he has pre meditated the violence in lhasa for the last 50 years dalai has maintained relations with the western forces particularly the anti china forces in fact they are the sources of his strength and he is being used as an instrument of hostile forces
1355912 however dalai is spreading misinformation through the media and in the period of opening up he is out to damage the image of china we have to counter that propaganda we have to show to the whole world the truth in tibet the reality in tibet
1355913 there is no point in discussing with him about the future of tibet up to 1959 he was the minister in chief in tibet he is no one in tibet now tibetan autonomous region government and the chinese government are the only representatives of tibet we are ready to discuss with him only the future of the 14th dalai lama and not of the future of tibet
1355914 for example on pages where users are typically focused on reading an article ads placed directly below the end of the editorial content tend to perform very well it is almost as if users finish reading and ask themselves what can i do next precisely targeted ads can answer that question for them
1355915 for organic local whole foods less processed and packaged foods organic and local meat and dairy consumption as well as decreased consumption and sustainable seafood
1355916 the great thing about buying locally is you can usually talk to the person youre buying from about how they grew the food and how far it has traveled
1355917 you can have an interaction people dont really have at a big supermarket
1355918 will give people better options about what they can purchase
1355919 this is where i have to be enigmatically vague never say never ill say that im not working on one at the moment im not working on one at the moment doesnt mean nobody else is but that doesnt mean they are either sorry for the obvious pr reasons we cant talk about what were doing now
1355920 the final guide we have this year is to think of them in an e10 context that doesnt mean it wont change but this fall they wont be able to blow each others heads off
1355921 after lamenting the missed opportunity to make dick cheney his own vice president in 2001 mccain will have a chance to choose his very own cheney
1355922 we think its important that the american people have all the facts at their fingertips when it comes to john mccain and his vice presidential pick this site gives reporters voters and activists a chance to review the record and see for themselves that no matter who he picks a mccain ticket means more of the same for families already struggling to pay out of control energy costs keep their jobs and stay in their homes
1355923 it wasnt planned it was just a song i really loved that i heard nobody will ever know who official girl is about they think its about certain people but its not anything that happens in my personal life is personal i never actually put anything out there nobodys really known who ive dated
1355924 based on my past and how my last album came out i really need to come back much much stronger i wanted to have more personality i really want to tell a story when im doing a song vocally either you like my voice or you dont im not trying to blow like mariah back when she was doing that
1355925 whats funny about it is when i was growing up i wasnt confused i knew exactly what i was my dads filipino my mom is mexican west indian and a little melting pot in school you were either black or white being asian really wasnt anything until i got to high school and was modeling all the time and it was important because it intrigued people black people definitely didnt claim me before they were like light skinned over there shes just not for us its all perception the other day i was at the drugstore and this girl in line was like shes next the white girl im not white im not even close
1355926 we need to show people we are still the gunners and can win the title
1355927 it was difficult for me personally to see my team mates losing points when he was injured but it was not just me
1355928 everything changes players have to play in what is not their right positions and it is really difficult when you have to change things
1355929 i am very happy because until now i have not been playing for five months so it is great to be back here with all my mates
1355930 we have been getting better and better we are playing quite well at the moment and have won against a top team like real
1355931 we showed everyone we can still play well even if we have lost some players
1355932 now we have to win the title we play to win everything and we will try to do it
1355933 samir nasri is a very good player and we are lucky to have signed him i have played alongside him in the french national team and i know he will find his place in the arsenal team
1355934 i think he can do it and will show everyone he can play very well
1355935 everyone the fans as well are all very happy he is a very good player and it is important for us to keep him
1355936 i am confident he can do it again and he wants to show he is always a good player
1355937 the matter is closed now he ronaldo is a manchester united player its finished hell be playing here next season believe me its finished
1355938 rafael van der vaart is the first and possibly the only signing of the summer for real madrid
1355939 we believe that this squad is full of quality of plenty of talent its a team which is a great family very close
1355940 we said that the new arrivals would be few but of great quality that seemed logical after two successful seasons in which weve brought in 19 young promising players
1355941 this the low number of signings was a request of the board of directors
1355942 ronaldo is a fantastic player one of the best in the world
1355943 if he came it would be great of course but out of respect i cant say anything more about this matter
1355944 randy has told martin to get the players he wants and not worry about the money we all know we need more players we trust martin to know what the squad needs and to go and get the players
1355945 if martin oneill came to randy and said i need 30million for player x and the player would fit into what we are trying to do randy would have his cheque book out before martin could get past the players name
1355946 additionally he will be equally ready to fund the other players that martin says he needs randy has never said no to martin
1355947 randy is no roman abramovich but he does have a wallet and he will open it martin knows that randy has made it perfectly clear we do not have to sell a player to buy a player
1355948 randy is in it for the long term he wants europe he wants winning football he wants entertainment for the fans
1355949 this is more than a business to him villa is a passion
1355950 ive had two good seasons but youve got to keep challenging yourself as a player to keep progressing and hopefully this season i can push on again
1355951 playing in europe is a big boost to everyone at villa but it also means you are playing against different systems and players which presents a challenge in itself
1355952 you play against quality players in the premier league but europe will be different again
1355953 if i can play a bit in europe this season hopefully it will help me stay in the england squad and that i can win the first cap ashley young has had his first caps and i would love the same if i can impress the coach
1355954 i think european football will be that next step were ready to make that step as a team the players who have tasted europe before want to taste it again and the rest of us want it for the first time
1355955 i doubt well get rooney fit for the start of the season with the virus hes had
1355956 its a virus he picked up in nigeria and its not a nice one but quite a few have had it
1355957 its such a bad virus and hes got to be training to be fit
1355958 i dont know whether we will have a team ready nani is suspended anderson is in the olympic games
1355959 michael carricks come in this morning and he may play a part of the game on sunday
1355960 well this aint the best news in the world were far too thin on the ground at the moment up top i hope the silence on the transfer market is cos fergie is tieing something up only first team strikers with experience we have are rooney and tevez you cant count saha in my opinion for plenty of reasons 1 always injured 2 rumours are he was at the sunderland game and looks like he could be going there 3 when fergie talks about which strikers we have when saying frazier campbell has a chance he doesnt even name saha anymore does anyone know whats going on with manucho
1355961 i would hope there will be a few more coming in before the season starts three four five who knows
1355962 but sometimes the expectations from players advisors are way beyond where we can go
1355963 thats fine by me weve got a wage structure at west brom and the players all understand that its a philosophy i try to have and it wont be broken
1355964 but the search for new players is continuing there is a lot of work going on behind the scenes some targets get pretty close to coming to fruition and then disappear
1355965 on the other hand we continue to get closer to the finish line with other targets
1355966 i would like a few more bodies in but they have to be of the right quality if you cant get the right quality you just have to keep going
1355967 for me by the end of this window hopefully weve got a squad together that can compete for the first three or four months of the season and do okay
1355968 if we need to do anything in january hopefully we are in a position where we can continue to strengthen which we must do
1355969 hopefully the bigger picture is we do well this year and this time next season we are adding again and continually improving
1355970 ive had great support from the chairman and the board ever since ive been here
1355971 hopefully the reward is a bit of stability and a team that proves over the next few years that it is a premier league club
1355972 there is a substantial bid on the table and i think the board are contemplating that
1355973 there are one or two clubs who have expressed an interest in zheng zhi and i dont think it is fair on us or the clubs to name them there are some decisions im afraid i cant dictate and one of those decisions is the finance they need to keep this clubs head above water
1355974 im never going to interfere with that because it is the club which has to survive not me as a manager or any individual player
1355975 baraks declarations show that the israeli government failed to cope with hamas and the palestinian resistances steadfastness and they also failed because the palestinian people supports the resistance
1355976 barak and his fruitless government do not know that if they commit such follies they will pay a heavy price violence cruelty and terrorism cant provide occupation with safety and security

1356012 states like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world
1356013 our first priority must always be the security of our nation and that will be reflected in the budget i send to congress my budget supports three great goals for america
1356014 my budget includes the largest increase in defense spending in two decades
1356015 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1356016 we need to be able to address a national energy strategy and then try to work on environmental efficiencies as part of that plan
1356017 we cant just start with things like emission standards at a time when were at a crisis with the entire national energy policy
1356018 there was not enough emphasis that if we move aggressively toward sustainable energy we will transform our energy costs
1356019 we were not as clear as we might have been
1356020 my heart goes out to the families of the victims as well as to the community and the whole u p i was raised in the up and i know how much we yoopers value the serenity and safety that goes with living there when i was a kid we didnt even have a lock on our front door it wasnt needed and were not talking that long ago this kind of senseless act will bring the community together but will also leave scars that will make people think twice about their safety
1356021 i demand to know where al gore is declaring that this rise in the lake levels is all just media bunk and that were all still doomed because of global warming
1356022 he wants to tax oil companies profits which will raise the price of gas and use the money to help motorist pay for the more expensive gas is this robbing peter to pay peter
1356023 like any dog this breed needs to be matched with the right owner i dont know much about this specific owner or the circumstances but pit bulls are often a thugged out status symbol and are not given the assertive leadership they require heck it may have to come to the point where one needs to be licensed to own certain breeds banning them may only increase their mystique and status amongst those ill equipped to care for them
1356024 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1356025 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
1356026 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
1356027 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1356028 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
1356029 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1356030 young gore sets out for his new home where the sky is clear the water is clean and there are no republicans
1356031 former vice president al gore who for the past three decades has unsuccessfully attempted to warn humanity of the coming destruction of our planet only to be mocked and derided by the very people he has tried to save launched his infant son into space monday in the faint hope that his only child would reach the safety of another world
1356032 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
1356033 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
1356034 this is no fantasy no careless product of wild imagination no my friends these indictments that i have brought to you today specific charges herein against the individuals their acts of treason their ultimate aim of sedition these are matters of undeniable fact i ask you now to pronounce judgment on those accused

1356038 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
1356039 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
1356040 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices we cant drill our way out of the problem i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive energy plan
1356041 does this mean you endorse using gas hogs and large mansions
1356042 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will cause in the future catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
1356043 an overwhelming number of scientists have determined that catastrophic manmade global warming is real and that any further debate over the science is pointless
1356044 marketed not on the basis of science its about what is known or what can be proved about the natural world rather than the number of scientists who are willing to publicly commit to a particular opinion
1356045 an overwhelming number of scientists they are referring to scientists working under the auspices of the u n s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc that agrees man made greenhouse gas emissions are or will in the future wreak havoc on the climate
1356046 head counts of scientists seem to be the name of the global warming game
1356047 the white house has taken a beating over the years in the press on climate and facts no longer matter
1356048 the latest move was to list the polar bear as an endangered species
1356049 there are many more polar bears today than 40 years ago and predictions of the bears demise are entirely based on politically inspired speculation
1356050 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect other countries to say ok
1356051 regulate the pantries of america as well as thermostats and modes of personal transportation mccain and the bush administration are drinking the same kool aid the initial response from the bush administration to relevant new facts seems to be see no consensus hear no consensus speak no consensuses
1356052 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
1356053 son a fool with a plan can beat a genius with no plan
1356054 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
1356055 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
1356056 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
1356057 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
1356058 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
1356059 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
1356060 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1356061 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1356062 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
1356063 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
1356064 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
1356065 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
1356066 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
1356067 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
1356068 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
1356069 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
1356070 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
1356071 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
1356072 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
1356073 presents a vivid alarming profile of americas current financial status
1356074 the story of americas four key deficits budget savings balance of payments and leadership
1356075 suggestions for how best to recreate a fiscally sound nation for future generations
1356076 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
1356077 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
1356078 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
1356079 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
1356080 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1356081 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1356082 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1356083 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1356084 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1356085 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1356086 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
1356087 a young man born in the middle of this century and from the middle of this country
1356088 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
1356089 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
1356090 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1356091 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
1356092 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
1356093 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
1356094 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
1356095 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
1356096 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
1356097 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
1356098 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
1356099 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
1356100 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
1356101 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
1356102 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
1356103 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
1356104 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
1356105 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1356106 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1356107 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1356108 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1356109 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1356110 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1356111 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1356112 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1356113 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1356114 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1356115 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1356116 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1356117 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1356118 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1356119 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1356120 weve stopped thinking in terms of hillary people and obama people what was good about this was that we got everybody involved
1356121 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
1356122 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
1356123 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
1356124 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
1356125 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
1356126 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
1356127 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
1356128 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
1356129 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
1356130 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
1356131 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
1356132 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
1356133 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
1356134 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
1356135 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1356136 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1356137 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1356138 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
1356139 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
1356140 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
1356141 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1356142 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1356143 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1356144 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
1356145 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
1356146 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
1356147 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1356148 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
1356149 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
1356150 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
1356151 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
1356152 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
1356153 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
1356154 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
1356155 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
1356156 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
1356157 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
1356158 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
1356159 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
1356160 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
1356161 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
1356162 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
1356163 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
1356164 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1356165 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1356166 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1356167 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1356168 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
1356169 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories

1356172 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1356173 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1356174 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1356175 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1356176 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
1356177 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
1356178 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
1356179 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
1356180 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
1356181 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
1356182 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
1356183 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
1356184 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
1356185 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
1356186 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
1356187 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
1356188 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
1356189 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
1356190 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1356191 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1356192 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
1356193 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
1356194 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
1356195 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
1356196 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
1356197 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1356198 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1356199 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1356200 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
1356201 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1356202 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1356203 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1356204 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1356205 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
1356206 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
1356207 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
1356208 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
1356209 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
1356210 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1356211 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1356212 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1356213 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
1356214 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
1356215 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
1356216 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
1356217 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
1356218 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1356219 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
1356220 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1356221 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
1356222 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
1356223 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
1356224 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
1356225 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1356226 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1356227 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1356228 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1356229 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
1356230 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
1356231 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1356232 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1356233 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1356234 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1356235 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1356236 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
1356237 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
1356238 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
1356239 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
1356240 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
1356241 if the vice president says its do able i believe
1356242 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
1356243 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so

1356247 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
1356248 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
1356249 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
1356250 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1356251 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
1356252 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
1356253 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
1356254 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
1356255 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
1356256 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
1356257 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
1356258 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
1356259 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
1356260 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
1356261 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1356262 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
1356263 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
1356264 a very cute little girl grabbed my leg and asked where are my parents where are my brothers
1356265 i saw her parents and brothers were on a plane that was set to take off in three minutes
1356266 i ran quickly because i knew that every minute mattered at the same time the police tried to contact the flight attendants to get them to stop the plane when i reached the gate the plane was no longer there
1356267 were in shock theyre very responsible and organized top notch people apparently one relied on the other and this is what happened
1356268 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1356269 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
1356270 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
1356271 key positions you have embraced that we believe are essential to sustaining this movement
1356272 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
1356273 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
1356274 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
1356275 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
1356276 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
1356277 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
1356278 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
1356279 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
1356280 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush

1356305 obamas revised position on a key energy issue was his second shift in three days
1356306 obama in shift urges tapping oil from u s reserve
1356307 had met with economic advisers and business leaders in washington last week and they had advised him to call for tapping the government reserve
1356308 team obama cast the proposal as a refinement rather than a flip flop on obamas previous opposition to tapping the 770 million barrel reserve
1356309 energy policy is offering more flip flops than a lake tahoe souvenir stand

1356329 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
1356330 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
1356331 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey

1356367 he wouldnt even try to sit up on his own
1356368 i ordered the recumbent bicycle from bike works in brandon and i had to special order the pedals they had to fashion a guard that extends several inches from the bottom of the pedal to keep my foot from turning in so that my foot does not unlock
1356369 in the beginning he used voice recognition but once he got use to the keyboard he did not need the software anymore
1356370 that is the whole problem with a child who develops cp if they dont ever push it and use those muscles they will never work the more you use the muscles the better they will function
1356371 it was basically a draw to become active i knew that i was able to balance and pedal on a stationary bike when i began i had no stamina at all i could do barely any miles with time and persistence i was able to bring my average mileage up
1356372 it is also improving my gait my knees have a tendency to draw together turn in when i am walking the training is giving me the strength to keep my knees apart
1356373 i think over all it is attitude and will that gets me on the bike the training will help you but unless you have the motivation and the inspiration to do it and to overcome pain you wont succeed

1356382 there are psychiatrists and there are psychologists so whats the difference and which one are you
1356383 the rally drew 75 000 people but the media did not give any credit to the opening act the decemberists who are wildly popular in portland
1356384 im not saying that obama wouldnt have drawn a big crowd but certainly when you have a band that popular opening for him on a beautiful day that probably should have been mentioned by the media
1356385 youd think the media would find it interesting that a presidential candidate had a band open for him that typically plays the soviet national anthem the song that celebrates communism in russia

1356468 the energy information agency eia projects that if we go the drilling route we could hit peak production of 200 000 barrels a day by 2030
1356469 there are alternatives to drilling for oil in environmentally sensitive areas that can produce real results conservation is the most obvious suppose we raised average fuel efficiency to 40 mpg by 2030 this would save us more than 5 million barrels of oil per day 25 times as much as we would get from senator mccains offshore drilling since many cars sold today already get more than 40 mpg this is hardly an unrealistic target wherever we set our targets the simple arithmetic shows that it is far easier to have an impact on oil markets through conservation than drilling in environmentally sensitive areas

1356491 lifetime social security benefits depend in large part on longevity
1356492 at every age african american men and women both have shorter life expectancies than do their white counterparts as a result a black man or woman earning exactly the same lifetime wages and paying exactly the same lifetime social security taxes as his or her white counterpart will likely receive a far lower rate of return
1356493 a black male born today has a life expectancy of 64 8 years but the social security retirement age for that worker in the future will be 67 years that means probably the majority of black males will never even receive social security retirement benefits
1356494 benefits are calculated on the basis of the highest 35 years of earnings over a workers lifetime workers must still pay social security taxes during years outside those 35 but those taxes do not count toward or earn additional benefits generally those low earnings years occur early in an individuals life that is particularly important to african americans because they are likely to enter the workforce at an earlier age than whites
1356495 elderly african americans are much more likely than their white counterparts to be dependent on social security benefits for most or all of their retirement income
1356496 african americans would be among those with the most to gain from the privatization of social security transforming the program into a system of individually owned privately invested accounts
1356497 the personal accounts would produce far higher returns and benefits for lower income workers african americans hispanics women and other minorities

1356807 parents in the dublin 15 area have suffered greatly over the last 15 years due to the failure of fingal county council and the department of education to properly coordinate the granting of planning permission for new houses with the construction of new schools this new code of practice the provision of schools and the planning system seeks to ensure that local authorities and the department of education are working together and meeting the needs of local communities
1356808 this new code of practice builds on the principle set out by minister gormley in recent guidelines on sustainable residential development in urban areas where it was set down that no new large estates should be built before an assessment of the need for school places in the area or the provision of new schools places at the same time as the residential development the two documents are part of the commitment the green party obtained within the programme for government to reform the manner in which schools are planned and developed throughout the country
1356809 some of the proposals in the new document mirror practices that have been occurring in fingal already such as the department of education using the local authority as its agent in purchasing sites for schools and also the use of multi school campuses which also contain community facilities
1356810 there is also a proposal to exempt from the planning system temporary school buildings and minor development works in schools this will mean that these works which are often of an emergency nature can now happen with minimum delay

1356830 rampant habitat loss exacerbated by hunting for food and to supply the wildlife trade in traditional chinese medicine and pets
1356831 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1356832 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1356833 were going back almost 10 million years before any previously described asian anthropoid
1356834 the new fossils from india are exciting because they show that the anthropoid lineage is much more ancient than we realized
1356835 most of the fossil record of ancient primates is made up of teeth because teeth are easy to preserve and hard
1356836 occasionally we get lucky enough to have a skull to work with but in this case a few teeth is all we have
1356837 from the tooth size and structure we can say something about the animals body weight and diet because teeth have crests that are differentially developed depending on whether they ate primarily insects leaves or fruit
1356838 nkoranza north district recently created has many teething problems with regard to revenue generation and development of the sites would enhance its fortunes
1356839 while it is still somewhat unclear what assumptions are driving marvels film production guidance the contribution from the film slate in 2008 and lifetime appears to be about 60 of what we were expecting on a revenue basis and at a lower margin

1356863 obama is a tad cooler than mccain on probably 57 fronts
1356864 obamas better looking than mccain obamas more stylish than mccain obamas more fit than mccain he refers to better music than mccain
1356865 mccain that guys not cool i just cant call mccain cool
1356866 hes younger i think he has more of a connection with my generation i just think he communicates better to my generation especially with issues in iraq mccain is all right but not as cool as obama
1356867 what obamas been able to do is capitalize on his hipness at least as far as younger voters go
1356868 i think its not that they dont support his issues and his policies but younger voters are more willing to work for him and work passionately for him because hes someone who resonates more on their wavelength
1356869 look at hugh hefner hell be cool til the day he dies but for him and for ron paul or anybody whos elderly and whos cool part of it is what they represent that makes them that
1356870 the most important thing in terms of reaching youth is not being cool its being authentic or true to who you are
1356871 i think hed look ridiculous if he tried to purposefully seem younger than he is if he started doing extreme sports or something ridiculous
1356872 has a very conservative image and that doesnt really help him either
1356873 shes not the type like obamas wife who can get down and dirty with younger people and really relate to them
1356874 yes market growth has come down this year compared to last year but overall russia is a growth engine
1356875 we are doing well and i believe we can keep growing market share step by step it is a very profitable market so the total contribution from russia to carlsbergs performance and business is extremely important
1356876 the fed is really locked in right now they cant go forward or backward
1356877 kentuckians like all americans are hard hit by record high gas prices
1356878 these tough times call for creative solutions and i believe allowing kentuckians the option of using an electric vehicle is one of those solutions electric vehicles may help ease the burden on the pocketbooks of hard working kentucky families as well as reduce their carbon footprint
1356879 in addition my administration will also aggressively pursue any economic development opportunities to recruit manufacturers and the jobs that come with this growing field
1356880 we will work diligently to develop and implement standards to ensure safe operation of these vehicles on kentucky roads

1356912 or should we redefine dying in the context of games isnt it more like tennis where you can lose a set but go on to win the game or are there bigger lessons to be learned from games
1356913 i was fed up with the way games companies are run the long hours culture the complete chaos and the fact that obviously i was a frustrated designer working purely as a coder
1356914 i had been self employed before and i think i just have the dna that makes me a better lone gunman than someone elses employee

1356945 i certainly hope to be an advocate for smart stories and smart debate about issues involving race and also to be a champion for hiring and promoting people from diverse backgrounds who really excel
1356946 what role do you think if any race has played in your life and career
1356947 thats an interesting question you know im mixed race my dad is black my mother is white
1356948 you think its a net plus or a net minus when you put it all together your race
1356949 well i think its a net plus for me again as a journalist just because i think it broadens my field of vision if you will in terms of stories and issues and i think its been a strength as a manager because i think ive seen potential and strength in people of various backgrounds that perhaps other managers would not have you know one of my proudest accomplishments at newsweek was hiring fareed zakaria who is became our foreign affairs columnist and editor of newsweek international im not sure that somebody else would necessarily have seen his potential in quite the same way at that point in his career
1356950 any additional sort of pressure to calibrate interest in and concern about issues of concern to african americans for fear of being seen as biased in perhaps a way that a person of another background might not
1356951 well my feeling at newsweek always was and its also my feeling at nbc my first priority is to do the best job i can so you know at newsweek it was to be the best editor i could be in washington it will be the best bureau chief and that you know i dont see that in racial terms you know i dont think that ken chenault goes to work everyday at american express and says you know how can i help black folks in my job
1356952 i think i think he thinks that way but i think his first priority is to be the strongest possible ceo for american express
1356953 having said that i think anybody in a job of influence has an area where they can champion causes well not necessarily causes if youre a journalist but issues and stories and coverage and so forth that is of particular interest and i have i think been a stronger advocate for coverage of issues involving race and what i like to think of as sophisticated coverage and not just knee jerk coverage than i think somebody else might have been one of the things just in the last year working with nightly we did a whole week long series on black women that i suggested and that got a tremendous amount of attention and debate my first priority is going to be to be the best bureau chief i can but along the way i certainly hope to be an advocate for smart stories and smart debate about issues involving race and also to be a champion for hiring and promoting people from diverse backgrounds who really excel
1356954 im going to be the executive to whom the executive producer at meet the press will report
1356955 the worst of the three networks on the score of offering up latino guests
1356956 i will say however that i one of the things ive done in the last year here in new york has been to be part of the nbc news diversity council which looks at all of those issues we take them very seriously we recognize that we have work to do i think weve made progress in a number of areas but i intend to use my influence in washington to continue that progress
1356957 we had been affectionately warned by his colleague juju chang in her introduction that martin loved dirty jokes the fact that he loved dirty jokes in inappropriate places did not come up
1356958 shortly after he began bashir remarked how exciting it was for him to be in a room full of great looking asian babes and then added that he was glad he was standing behind a podium so no one could see how excited he really was
1356959 it took me about five seconds for the comment to sink in and then i did something i rarely do in public i started booing shockingly i wasnt joined by too many people
1356960 im happy to be in the midst of so many asian babes he said onstage with his 20 20 colleague juju chang nearby
1356961 we should go a bit further i was wondering about a hip hop reference and connect him to the
1356962 or why not the great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
1356963 the jokes premise might have worked with a comedians touch it might have been seen as edgy but from bashir it was neither edgy clever witty or entertaining it was just strange like watching someone like imus break dance and flash gang signs to gain street cred
1356964 this kind of remark has no place in any setting and martin knows that and is truly sorry for his serious error in judgment
1356965 when i first heard martins ridiculous joke i thought oh man what an inappropriate thing to say but ive known martin for a long time hes a good man who said a dumb thing he has since apologized to me for his boorishness and i know he deeply regrets it
1356966 i wanted to write and apologize for an inappropriate comment that i made at the aaja dinner last friday and for the offence that it caused to those present
1356967 upon reflection it was a tasteless remark that i now bitterly regret
1356968 i am grateful to you for the opportunity to address those present and hope that the continuing work of the organization will not by harmed or undermined by my moment of stupidity
1356969 we dont censor our speakers or tell them what they should say particularly as a journalism organization i appreciate the point he was trying to make but could his speech have been in better taste i would say so
1356970 bashir talked about cultural identity and how for many journalists especially those who are just starting in their careers it could be considered as an obstacle instead of an asset
1356971 never before have i seen management treat its employees as contemptuously as tribune co managers have treated those at the sun
1356972 they treat everybody badly what happened to me had nothing to do with the color of my skin i was going to lose my column
1356973 i said i could take the money and be miserable at home
1356974 as a result there will not be any involuntary separations
1356975 im focusing on my literary organization the national book club conference my annual event ended just yesterday it was extraordinary with
1356976 and im teaching sports reporting at morehouse starting this semester
1356977 im seeking work in the communications profession however broadly that can be defined but dont have any firm leads as of yet
1356978 after the buyout the diversity percentage will remain about the same this means we should still be among the top for newspapers our size
1356979 and the republicans they dont have any new ideas thats why theyre spending all their time talking about me theyre going to try to say that im a risky guy theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills
1356980 rick davis the campaign manager for senator mccain issued a statement thursday tough one saying barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
1356981 his comments were clearly were clearly the race card because of what he said everybody can read his remarks and in fact his campaign retracted these remarks so i think its very clear and i was very disappointed
1356982 all right go ahead mayor and tell us what you think about this uproar because its obviously a serious matter
1356983 well i dont know that it is that serious i think its probably more reflective of the fact that the mccain campaign has had a bad several weeks in terms of the schizophrenic nature of their attacks on senator senator obama everything from the paris hilton ad and the foolishness of that and the fact that the economy is still the dominant issue in this campaign
1356984 obviously hes not playing it to black voters i dont think so hes going to get practically all of those votes to get moderate white voters who are sensitive to the race issue for what benefit i cant answer the question
1356985 and then bositis told me that he thinks the mccain campaign is desperate and theyre throwing everything but the kitchen sink at obama
1356986 the popular image of the campaign mccain bantering with national journalists in the back of his bus has in reality all but vanished the traveling press is now routinely stiffed in favor of five minute sit downs with local reporters
1356987 at the same time the arizona senator is having trouble making news or at least news that advances his campaigns goals and when he does it is often reacting to the media hurricane that surrounds barack obama
1356988 price was among at least three other reporters and the only black reporter surrounding mccains campaign bus gov charlie crist and his fiancee carole rome were already aboard when a member of the arizona senators security detail asked the reporter to identify himself price had shown his media credentials to enter the area
1356989 when another reporter asked why price was being removed she too was led out of the area other state reporters remained
1356990 i would first express regret that your reporter was moved and i can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that race had nothing to do with it
1356991 what i think this debate is really about is acknowledging privilege
1356992 just last february univision announced that it had hired mackin away from hearst argyle television where he had managed the station groups web and dtv initiatives prior to that role he had managed 14 of the hearst argyle stations at univision mackin was responsible for the companys 64 spanish language univision and telefutura stations
1356993 jim hummel an abc6 news reporter for the past 13 years who is known for the you paid for it investigative segments resigned yesterday morning saying he was disturbed by the sensational direction the station has been taking
1356994 the former providence journal reporters departure comes 10 months after abc6 was bought by global broadcasting of southern new england hummel said there was pressure to sensationalize news and use slang such as lowlife and thug to describe defendants in an effort to increase ratings for the third place local news station
1356995 it happened on a beach on july 31 1968 the white boys little sister threw his beach ball into the water
1356996 the black boy who was swimming retrieved the ball and took it back to him the white boy thanked the black boy and that was how charlie brown met franklin in peanuts with that appearance franklin became the first black person in charles schulzs magnificent comic strip happy 40th franklin
1356997 spanish speaking news outlets all across the country have grown to become major players in their markets and all trends indicate that growth is only going to continue
1356998 one startling change has been the tv watching habits of hispanic viewers in 1995 most hispanic viewers in new york primarily watched english language television 62 percent over spanish language stations 38 percent according to nielsen media research last year viewers favored the spanish stations 71 to 29 percent similar trends are happening elsewhere that might be alarming to people who believe these new citizens arent assimilating into their new country but univision executives say the majority of their viewers homes are bilingual

1357011 without a sale it is even possible that bmn would be dismantled altogether which would put all of bmns employees including the unions members out of work bmn its employees and the communities it serves will be severely harmed if this happens due to the loss of jobs and three local newspapers
1357012 it does lay out an extreme case of what could happen if eventually a sale were not made but certainly there is not any indication in this filing nor is it accurate that the newspapers going to be closed down next week or next month
1357013 it is a possibility that this could happen if over time we were not able to get a sale and business conditions continue to deteriorate

1357023 ive found an old wetsuit boot and flung it out
1357024 i caught it and was astonished to realise it was a hobnail boot
1357025 the sole of the boot has lots of nails hammered in to give it grip

1357055 given that the northern spotted owl has been experiencing about a 4 percent annual rate of population decline for the last 15 years any reductions from current levels of habitat protection cannot be justified
1357056 they are sort of rushing to this assumption of if it hasnt been identified as an owl conservation area it isnt going to be providing any habitat area to the owls and that simply is not true
1357057 we feel like we have a pretty solid broad network of habitat to work with for the recovery of the owl

1357084 its to do something outside the mundane to do something to challenge myself and something to define the year

1357119 here is something i do not quite understand with asian women who prefer white men do they really have to attack demonize and vilify asian men as an asian man i prefer white and latin women first however i am not going to sink to the level to say that i date other women because there is something wrong with asian women or because asian women are at fault unfortunately asian women who prefer white men seem to always have to resort to blaming and attacking asian men in order to justify themselves is that necessary or compulsory

1357292 ive tried to figure out where senator obama is on this it doesnt sound to me like hes changed his position hes pretty strongly against drilling and against domestic production he gave an energy speech that i might point out is two months after senator mccain led out the lexington project in five separate speeches on this issue but he seems to be pretty firmly against drilling even now
1357293 i think obama was smart politically to kind of blunt the advantage that mccain had on drilling by saying as part of a compromise im happy to do that hes not a rigid ideological politician hes willing to make a deal
1357294 i think obama is willing to take positions which will offend some groups that have rigidly supported rigid positions in the past but as long as he can expand and reach to new groups hes going to go for it off shore oil drilling has never been popular in the democratic party but i think the obama campaign has seen that hes got to reduce the pain at the pump at least to get him through the summer driving season
1357295 i dont think its a flip flop i think at the end of the day these are complicated issues and if theyre going to basically do as they say they are have a comprehensive energy plan or a comprehensive war plan they have to have bipartisan support theyre now down to fighting for the independents each side has got their democrats or their republicans and its this large segment in the middle thats getting larger and larger has not yet made up its mind and thats the battlefield from now until the election
1357296 weve got to cut these guys a little bit of a break if youre going to make a bipartisan compromise you do have to accept stuff that youre not for lets not forget if were talking about a flip flop john mccain flip flopped on this same issue

1357320 unfortunately no matter the outcome of this trial this schedule alone may not be enough to ensure that senator stevens has the ability to compete meaningfully in the upcoming election
1357321 senator stevens must be able to campaign albeit limitedly during the trial were venue transferred to alaska senator stevens would have the opportunity to campaign in the evenings and on weekends during the trial
1357322 if they have evidence this thing suggests why didnt they indict bribery
1357323 it suggests they wanted to prosecute in the district of columbia on the false statement charges because they thought it would be easier to get a conviction here
1357324 maybe they didnt want to prosecute the case in alaska because they were afraid the people up there would have been sympathetic to him
1357325 things are going to come out that they never knew about sen stevens
1357326 once the damning evidence becomes public the house of cards begins to fall
1357327 bring charges on what they can actually prove there may be things out there that they didnt charge because its a little squishy bribery cases are exceeding difficult to prove against a politician
1357328 it is entirely unacceptable for members of congress to accept hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts for businesses that theyre helping with their legislative power
1357329 there is actually no explanation that mr stevens can give that is good enough about why it was okay for bill allen to give him 250 000 worth of gifts
1357330 anytime a united states senator a u s congressman or others are charged with intentionally hiding gifts thats a very serious charge those gift rules are there for a reason theyre there to protect the integrity of our system

1357396 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1357397 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1357398 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1357399 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1357400 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

1357422 we have developed a strategic relationship with newtec over the years and have found its products to be both innovative and highly reliable
1357423 for this particular project newtecs tellinet software platform has been integrated into our skyarcs product line and it has already demonstrated significant improvement in the internet experience of the users through increased browsing speed and network security

1357476 we love the distinctive characteristics found in our vineyard partner brosseaus chalone appellation chardonnay but the weather is a tad too warm to produce grapes with the amount of acid we require for our wines this posed a dilemma given our natural approach

1357505 theyre bringing in everything theyre bringing in scrap iron and steel aluminum brass stainless steel
1357506 just as were speaking a pickup truck is coming across our scale with some farm equipment and some old barbed wire fence
1357507 they get money here and they supplement their income and pay for their food and their fuel and their rent and everything else

1357524 finishing down there hurts it hurt me and the rest of the lads they feel that as much as i do last year we had to turn it around and eventually we put a run together it will be another tough year because every club is improving everyone is throwing money at it and getting better buying better players we have to keep up with that if you stand still you can go backwards
1357525 hes a fantastic player i hope he can score a lot of goals for liverpool and that i can play alongside him many times weve only been training together for a few days but the important thing for me is that he is always talking during games

1357629 i am very sorry to say that it is a reality that the molson kawasaki racing team will cease to operate next season
1357630 kawasaki heavy industries kawasaki motors europe and kawasaki motors uk have over the past 10 years formed a fantastic relationship with the church family who own the team based on trust and passion for success with our race machines the team their staff their riders and have always given us 100 per cent commitment and professionalism
1357631 we had big plans for the team to continue as our official factory supported mx2 team in 2009 and so understandably we are deeply disappointed that this will not be possible we will maintain our full support to the molson team until the end of this season and truly believe that they will finish it in style and on top of the podium
1357632 making the decision that the team will stop has been one of the hardest decisions we have ever made but we feel it is the right time and it is the best decision all round
1357633 it is a very sad time for all of us but we want to enjoy the rest of the season as well as continue to work hard towards winning the british mx2 title with stephen sword and well hopefully reach the gp podium at least once more this year too
1357634 we would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who we have worked with over the years the riders mechanics and sponsors past and present for their support towards the team and for helping to create some great memories for us
1357635 we have been with kawasaki right from the start of toms racing career and its been a long standing and very rewarding relationship we are very grateful to kawasaki for putting so much trust into us and our team and for giving us the opportunity to run their factory mx2 team it was a great honor for us
1357636 it was a very difficult decision to make as you can imagine but we discussed it together as a family and made the decision to end the team on a high rather than potentially face difficulties as our family priorities changed and we were perhaps unable to give kawasaki the team our riders and the hardworking team staff our full focus and attention which is what they all deserve
1357637 weve had a very enjoyable and healthy relationship with kawasaki over the years and i believe its been mutually beneficial

1357656 empty your mind of all thoughts let your heart be at peace return to the common source returning to the source is serenity
1357657 sampajanna is sometimes translated as awareness so sati sampajanna becomes mindfulness and awareness as though awareness is not automatically included as part of mindfulness
1357658 mindfulness is general recollectedness not being scatter brained whereas awareness is more precisely keeping oneself under constant observation not letting ones actions or thoughts or feelings etc pass unnoticed
1357659 during the era of the transcendentalists especially between the 1840s and the 1880s largely influencing the american traditions of spiritualism theosophy and mental healing
1357660 two roads diverged in a yellow wood and sorry i could not travel both both and
1357661 thats my man brett whatever he wants is fine with me
1357662 i wish this husband of mine could make up his mind
1357663 we are really pleased that graham has chosen to stay with us especially after a lot of interest from other counties
1357664 he is one of the most promising young bowlers in the country and im sure he will continue to be a great asset to our team
1357665 to be able to boast an effective bowling attack made up of local lads which include liam plunkett and mark davies reflects well on the area
1357666 im delighted to be staying at durham i love playing for the club and the decision to stay was an easy one to make
1357667 its been a great environment for me to develop my game and the set up here has been great for me over the years
1357668 december 16 1848 the lord gave me a view of the shaking of the powers of the heavens
1357669 him that overcometh will make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name
1357670 and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god
1357671 perseverance is a means that god has appointed by which one will be saved we will use the words condition and means interchangeably when we use the words sic means we use it in the sense that perseverance is a necessary means that god has appointed for attaining final salvation
1357672 conditional warnings and admonitions suspend gods judgment in the last day on perseverance in this age since the reformation many protestant christians have tended to overstate pauls doctrine of justification with the effect that pauls orientation on salvation as not yet fully realized has virtually collapsed for paul justification remains fundamentally the eschatological verdict
1357673 is that they convert the consequence of perseverance salvation not yet attained into the cause of perseverance salvation already possessed
1357674 jesus speaking to his disciples said it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved matt 10 22 cf 24 13 now at first glance that appears to contradict the truth that god is going to keep us saved but it doesnt we are energized to endure by the indwelling spirit the mark of justification is perseverance in righteousness to the very end
1357675 the one who is saved will persevere unto the end
1357676 the one who perseveres to the end will be saved
1357677 perseverance is a means that god has appointed by which one will be saved we will use the words condition and means interchangeably when we use the words means we use it in the sense that perseverance is a necessary means that god has appointed for attaining final salvation
1357678 my problem is the word attaining persevering is not a necessary evidence of justification but it actually attains justification
1357679 is both biblically and theologically accurate but the text we are examining does not say that
1357680 the one who is saved will persevere unto the end
1357681 it would follow that our justification is held in suspense until the final judgment
1357682 everyone who believes is justified acts 13 39 showing that righteousness becomes theirs
1357683 running with confidence being assured that we shall win the prize
1357684 it would follow that our justification is held in suspense until the final judgment
1357685 schreiner and caneday acknowledge this for they also say conditional warnings and admonitions suspend gods judgment in the last day on perseverance in this age since the reformation many protestant christians have tended to overstate pauls doctrine of justification with the effect that pauls orientation on salvation as not yet fully realized has virtually collapsed for paul justification remains fundamentally the eschatological verdict ibid p 154 160 161
1357686 conditional warnings and admonitions suspend gods judgment in the last day on perseverance in this age
1357687 without realizing it this author transposes jesus warning from a prospective incentive for perseverance to the end into a retrospective test that exposes pseudodisciples by their past behavior how does this transposition occur it begins with conceptual discomfort because conditional warnings and admonitions suspect gods judgment in the last day on perseverance in this age
1357688 although we have already shown in chapter two how new testament writers have a dual orientation in their concept of salvation including both already and not yet it may be helpful to summarize briefly pauls perspective we do so primarily because since the reformation many protestant christians have tended to overstate pauls doctrine of justification
1357689 observe then how steve fernandez ripped the bolded italicized underlined portion from its context to say what he wanted to say
1357690 since the reformation many protestant christians have tended to overstate pauls doctrine of justification
1357691 commits the common reductionistic error of presuming that any discussion of salvation is necessarily a discussion of justification
1357692 since the reformation many protestant christians have tended to overstate pauls doctrine of justification
1357693 with the effect that pauls orientation on salvation as not yet fully realized has virtually collapsed
1357694 many protestant christians have tended to overstate pauls doctrine of justification so that it swallows up all other metaphors for salvation
1357695 since the reformation many protestant christians have tended to overstate pauls doctrine of justification so that it swallows up all other metaphors for salvation
1357696 the overstatement of justification it would seem is clearly their disagreement with the reformed teaching that justification is a completed and final declaration made at the point of first believing
1357697 salvations already aspects with the effect that pauls orientation on salvation as not yet fully realized has virtually collapsed into an overrealized view that the whole of salvation is already fully ours
1357698 in him who raised jesus our lord from the dead
1357699 it could be samits final championship game of the season for us and its an important game for him to continue his run of form and catch the eye
1357700 somerset have a quality opening pair in marcus trescothick and justin langer and it is important that we achieve a big score in our first innings bilal shafayat is feeling good after his hundred last week and wed like to see a century from one of the batsmen in this game

1357704 we demand the academic freedom to gain knowledge and a society that doesnt allow scientists to do that has got a problem
1357705 the people who are responsible for the recent vandalism are acting criminally aside from impairing scientific research and damaging property they are now putting innocent people at risk
1357706 the industry is very anxious that unfavorable facts dont get out there one tactic is to tar any critic as irrational
1357707 its really tough to get our viewpoints represented in the media
1357708 the biotech industrys claims about genetically altered crops are perennially overstated in truth agricultural biotechnology has almost nothing to offer to the world food crisis in the short term
1357709 when gmos were developed in the u s we didnt know what was hitting us it was in our food service before people understood what gmo meant
1357710 by the time gmos became standard we had no choice we couldnt have labeling because it was already happening by the time it got across the pond in the uk they had the advantage of seeing it happen here first

1357729 if you professor glover were stranded at the midnight hour in a desolate los angeles street and if as you stepped out of your car with fear and trembling you were suddenly to hear the weight of pounding footsteps behind you and you saw 10 burly young men who had just stepped out of a dwelling coming toward you would it or would it not make a difference to you to know that they were coming from a bible study
1357730 the greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is christians who acknowledge jesus with their lips and walk out the door and deny him by their lifestyle that is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable

1357778 there will always be speculation about good players and vedran is a very good player
1357779 rafael van der vaart is a player of great quality vision and talent
1357780 we are certain that he will be a player who will help us complement the already very strong squad we have
1357781 he is the first and almost certainly the last signing we will make this season
1357782 i doubt well get rooney fit for the start of the season with the virus hes had
1357783 its a virus he picked up in nigeria and its not a nice one but quite a few have had it
1357784 its such a bad virus and hes got to be training to be fit
1357785 theyve said its a bad virus and waynes not back in yet hes not been training its been a long time
1357786 rafael van der vaart is a player of great quality vision and talent
1357787 we are certain that he will be a player who will help us complement the already very strong squad we have
1357788 he is the first and almost certainly the last signing we will make this season
1357789 at the moment manchester united and the player are in an argument and madrid are waiting and we cant do any more for the time being
1357790 obviously its clear that we want cristiano with the quality that he has but there is a contractual problem that united and the player have to resolve not us
1357791 will he persuade the club to let him go i cant say that that questions for the player who has publicly said his dream is to play for madrid
1357792 well that just goes to show you that you dont need an eye to see
1357793 well that just goes to show you that you dont need an eye to see
1357794 i wasnt pleased with my results in wales especially on the first day i had to push really hard in conditions that i am not so strong in but here in france i knew i could be fast i rode well on both days especially on day two so its great to have won mika is not so far ahead in the championship now so the last two rounds of the series should be really exciting
1357795 i made some changes to my bike and my head and it seemed to have worked
1357796 i dont really know what was wrong on day two in wales or day one here but i rode like i should and like i normally do on day two
1357797 it was as if they did everything they to could make sure the enduro test didnt flow
1357798 it was difficult on a big bike which added to the heat made the second day really tiring
1357799 i crashed before the extreme test and as the bike hit the ground it sheered the bolt that holds the bars to the clamps by the time wed got the clamps off the spare bike i was out of time

1357806 it will be no surprise to anybody that billy and tommy are in the team it was the third member who was always going to be a very difficult choice shauns form has certainly stepped up a gear recently and he is regularly starting to challenge the established grand prix riders for podium places climbing onto the podium in both bulgaria and sweden billys mx1 british championship form has been devastating leaving everybody else to fight for 2nd place tommys world championship form speaks for itself taking his first double victory and leading the series after round 7 both riders like the donington park circuit and achieved excellent results at the mxgp in 2007 im sure shauns first appearance in the mxon team will spur him on even more we will certainly be aiming for the win tommy now has much more experience of climbing to the top of a world championship rostrum billys form on home soil and shauns determination plus of course the support from the partisan crowd will add inspiration to the team budds creek was my first mxon as manager and i enjoyed it immensely unfortunately we suffered from injury early on but beating the americans on home soil was always going to be difficult im sure we can make it as hard for other teams at donington
1357807 its the first time this season that ive finished on the podium on both days so i am very pleased its been a great race and it was a true enduro gp day one went very well for me but it was close between myself and albergoni day two didnt go so well though because i made some mistakes on the extreme test which cost me a lot of time
1357808 there were not a lot of places where you could pass cleanly so i spent the first few laps deciding where to get aubin

1357812 i had been using outside lines to make passes but they werent the fastest i was afraid to switch my lines though and paid the penalty as philippaerts led the others through i got a bit of arm pump too but i rode through it and was coming strongly again at the end

1357836 the strategy according to democratic aides pelosi takes the heat on energy policy while behind the scenes shes encouraging vulnerable democrats to express their independence if it helps them politically
1357837 pelosis gambit rests on one big assumption that democrats will own washington after the election and will be able to craft a sweeping energy policy that is heavy on conservation and fuel alternatives while allowing for some new oil drilling democrats see no need to make major concessions on energy policy with a party poised to lose seats in both chambers in just three months even if recess averse republicans continue to pound away on the issue

1357927 there is a common misconception that marine species are not as vulnerable to extinction as land based species
1357928 however we increasingly realize that marine biodiversity is also faced with serious environmental threat and that there is an urgent need to determine the worldwide extent of these pressures to guide marine conservation practice
1357929 these galapagos corals and algae are the first of many marine species that will be added to the red list due to our findings
1357930 what is significant is that climate change and over fishing two of the biggest threats to marine life are the likely causes in these cases
1357931 marine ecosystems are vulnerable to threats at all scales globally through climate change regionally from el ni o events and locally when over fishing removes key ecosystem building blocks
1357932 we need more effective solutions to manage marine resources in a more sustainable way in light of these increasing threats

1357934 5 and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge 6 and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness 7 and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity 8 for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ 9 but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall 11 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
1357935 an entrance will be supplied to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom
1357936 to be poor in spirit is to have a humble opinion of ourselves to be sensible that we are sinners and have no righteousness of our own to be willing to be saved only by the rich grace and mercy of god
1357937 13 and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner
1357938 7 but what things were gain to me those i counted loss for christ 8 yea doubtless and i count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ 9 and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith 10 that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death 11 if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead 12 not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus 13 brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before 14 i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus 15 let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you
1357939 out of our personal experience of the mercy of god
1357940 singleness of heart the honesty which has no hidden motive no selfish interest and is true and open in all things
1357941 at peace with god and thus themselves filled with sweet peace they live in peace if possible with all men and work to keep and to make peace where peace is threatened or lost theirs is the work of true christians who follow in the footsteps of the prince of peace
1357942 the tense and voice of the verb passive perfect may be regarded as permissive
1357943 who have allowed themselves to be persecuted or have endured persecution
1357944 the idea is that they did not flee from it but willingly submitted to when it came to them
1357945 29 for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake 30 having the same conflict which ye saw in me and now hear yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution

1357967 1 and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men ye are the light of the world a city that is set on an hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfil for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven for i say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raca shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift agree with thine adversary quickly whiles thou art in the way with him lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast into prison verily i say unto thee thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not commit adultery but i say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell 31 it hath been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement but i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery again ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is gods throne nor by the earth for it is his footstool neither by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black but let your communication be yea yea nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but i say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust for if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if ye salute your brethren only what do ye more than others 48 be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect
1357968 1 and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him a he saw the multitudes that were following him 25 and there followed him great multitudes of people from galilee and from decapolis and from jerusalem and from judaea and from beyond jordan
1357969 2 and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them
1357970 1 in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judaea 3 for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet esaias saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight
1357971 1 then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil 2 and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was afterward an hungred 3 and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple 6 and saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them 9 and saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me get thee hence satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison he departed into galilee 13 and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of zabulon and nephthalim 14 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles 16 the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw two brethren simon called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers follow me and i will make you fishers of men 21 and going on from thence he saw other two brethren james the son of zebedee and john his brother in a ship with zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people 24 and his fame went throughout all syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatick and those that had the palsy and he healed them from decapolis and from jerusalem and from judaea and from beyond jordan
1357972 gospel of the 23 and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people

1357974 wie die neueste ausgabe des open source barometers von alfresco veranschaulicht entwickelt sich ubuntu gerade zum neuen linux star
1357975 mit einem anteil von fast einem viertel aller linux os rollouts mit stand vom januar 2008 war ubuntu in der zweiten jahresh lfte 2007 auch die linux distribution mit der h chsten zuwachsrate mit der unterst tzung eines professionellen unternehmens wie canonical wollen wir diesen zunehmenden trend zu leicht installier und verwaltbaren open source produkten weiter voranbringen
1357976 wir freuen uns auf die zusammenarbeit mit alfresco zur bereitstellung eines f r den unternehmensweiten einsatz geeigneten content management systems f r ubuntu anwender f r die dies einen ersten schritt bedeutet
1357977 die anwender haben jetzt eine gro artige gelegenheit die alfresco l sung auf ubuntu zu evaluieren und die vorteile dieser beiden open source l sungen f r unternehmen kennenzulernen wir werden noch in diesem jahr eine vorkonfigurierte enterprise version der alfresco software anbieten

1357979 hari minggu di papua merupakan hari bagi tuhan menurut iman ajaran kristen sehingga sangat tidak layak bila hari minggu dijadikan sebagai hari kerja sebab hari tersebut sangat sakral dan ditabhiskan sebagai hari peribadatan bagi umat kristen
1357980 otsus adalah jawaban dari keinginan masyarakat papua yang ingin merdeka ini adalah jawaban allah tapi bagaimana dengan para pejabat yang membawa amanah allah ini otsus sudah berjalan tujuh tahun namun perdasus perdasi belum ada katanya dengan otsus rakyat papua merdeka 90 dalam bingkai nkri tapi yang ada adalah air mata
1357981 jeritan ini sudah lama lalu dimana keperpihakan otsus bagi orang papua
1357982 mencermati perkembangan itu dan masalah implementasi otsus di tanah papua maka fkki provinsi papua menyatakan sikap sebagai berikut pertama menolak uu dan hukum syariah dalam bentuk dan nama apapun di indonesia khususnya di papua karena berpotensi mengganti pancasila dan distintegrasi bangsa
1357983 ada kelompok yang mau ganti pancasila dengan idiologi lain tetapi pancasila saksi sebab pancasila yang menghidupkan agama agama di negeri ini yang mempersatukan bangsa ini dari berbagai ragam suku dan karena pancasila papua berada di dalam bingkai nkri oleh sebab itu masyarakat papua ada dalam posisi yang benar dan dalam kesempatan ini saya salut sebab umat kristen sudah memikirkan masalah itu
1357984 ingat yang menjual tuhan yesus adalah muridnya begitu juga yang terjadi di tanah ini yang menjual umat kristen adalah tokoh umat kristen itu sendiri dprp sangat sependapat dengan rakyat dan usulan saudara saudara kami akan teruskan
1357985 akibatnya dprp mau bikin insiatif perdasus sudah malas sebab uang saja sudah begini apalagi yang lain lain
1357986 jadi sudah ada perdasus tentang dana untuk agama dana untuk ekonomi dana untuk pendidikan macetnya dimana macetnya di gubernur karena belum ada peraturan gubernur dalam sidang anggaran nanti hal ini mungkin akan dipermasalahkan

1358245 hes younger i think he has more of a connection with my generation i just think he communicates better to my generation especially with issues in iraq mccain is all right but not as cool as obama

1358247 i think its not that they dont support his issues and his policies but younger voters are more willing to work for him and work passionately for him because hes someone who resonates more on their wavelength

1358323 manufacturers attempting to improve both operational and corporate performance should first examine the overall structure of their business processes as a general theme we find best in class manufacturers are most significantly differentiated from their competition by the incorporation of real time data into these processes specifically best in class manufacturers are more than twice as likely as laggard manufacturers to monitor exceptions on the plant floor in real time use real time data in production optimization processes and in using real time data for production release and control
1358324 to incorporate real time data into business processes many of the best in class are looking towards technology in fact 55 of the best in class are currently using automated spc statistical process control software which makes them 38 more likely than laggard manufacturers to be doing so

1358491 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
1358492 you can argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can be fully ready for the pressures of the office

1358496 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church
1358497 only in christ are all things in communion he is the point of convergence of all hearts and beings and therefore the bridge and the shortest way from each to each
1358498 the doctrine of justification by faith is in fact the great ecumenical doctrine

1358503 its kitten season and were right in the middle of it
1358504 were seeing dogs fly out the door but cats we have a little bit more of and so the idea being people are finding their income is a little bit short tie of year
1358505 lets say that we have one un spayed female lets just say she gives birth to a very conservative number say four kittens a year two of those are females within seven years she can contribute to 10 000 cats so thats the cat issue that were dealing with
1358506 they think well just have a few kittens and well get rid of them all somewhere and all of a sudden there are kittens up the ying yang
1358507 but if youre talking about body language about how you carry yourself about being positive and working together then yes thats something im talking to them about
1358508 its starting to disintegrate a bit and ive got to be a bit protective of it but this is the olympics and this is their turf olympians have their symbols and the baggy green cap isnt one of them
1358509 i had exactly the same concerns and fears that these guys have got
1358510 in the australian cricket team we often used to bring in outsiders from other sports to give us their insights
1358511 sometimes it only takes one word or a single phrase to spark something
1358512 yeah it was a bit of a circus but the swim team handled it very well theyre very professional
1358513 you can sense it and all i can tell them is that theyve done the work and now they just have to make sure they enjoy the experience
1358514 i reckon every sydney club nrl chief executive should be looking at gosford
1358515 if you dont look at it you havent done your job you would be silly not to look at it
1358516 ill put my hand up ill be happily called silly because were not looking at the central coast
1358517 but we wish the buldogs the best at the central coast the central coast bulldogs has a ring to it
1358518 if they move to the central coast that would be the worst thing they have ever done
1358519 they certainly wouldnt get my vote thats for sure if we could move back to belmore that would be the best move for us
1358520 i think a move to the central coast would be premature for them at the moment
1358521 if they dont change their thinking it wont matter where they end up the club is not going to be a success
1358522 having said that if they get their act together the league has a tremendous amount of incentive to go there it would be worth considering
1358523 we have had some frustrations and roadblocks in our current situation at sydney olympic park
1358524 it certainly hasnt transpired as we would have hoped were looking at a range of options going forward
1358525 people were threatened by the success of the ipl they were feeling that national integrity and the desire to play for your country could be threatened
1358526 who knows where thats going to go but being an olympic event that is going to draw you back to playing for and representing your country
1358527 i think there could be a great benefit for the olympic movement in and around that subcontinental asian area its a relationship that could work both ways
1358528 the idea of twenty20 cricket at the olympics is definitely worth pursuing if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
1358529 in the next few years i believe it twenty20 will become a worldwide phenomenon
1358530 should cricket make it to the olympics it would be significant especially to our country where the game is most loved
1358531 for those players to be out from a football perspective six days before a game when they have had an eight day break is just unacceptable and then to top it off by being dishonest to the people in an environment where you rely on honesty and you rely on trust is unforgivable
1358532 there needs to be a strong stance made by the club to set the tone not just for alan didak or heath shaw but for all young players at football clubs
1358533 i think heath deserves everything he cops but the one thing about it the lying part theres an unwritten law within footy clubs that you look after your mates and unless they do something that physically harms someone or is against the law maybe heath did the right thing in one way in helping out a mate but he probably picked the wrong person to do it for
1358534 obviously there is not much we can say apart from the fact that what heath has done is inexcusable and there is no defence
1358535 it is difficult to quantify what loss will be suffered by the loss of the first plaintiff bulldogs in respect of the above
1358536 our problem is is williams under contract with another rugby union side the answer is no
1358537 therefore hes free to join with whoever he wants he doesnt need a letter to leave
1358538 very serene very determined to make his entry into rugby union
1358539 i am unaware of any player who is presently available to be contracted by the first plaintiff as a replacement for the 2008 and 2009 seasons
1358540 without a replacement with a similar player the first plaintiffs ability to compete effectively in the 2008 and 2009 seasons could be impacted upon
1358541 in my view if the defendant williams does not play for the first plaintiff in the 2009 season this will impact substantially on the recruiting of the first plaintiff for the 2009 and 2010 season
1358542 this is because players may have been attracted to playing with the defendant at the first plaintiff
1358543 weve asked for one and we wont say anything on that until we get a written report from the organisation
1358544 we are waiting for todds manager to get back which will be thursday
1358545 were trying to get the board together and well give todd a hearing on thursday
1358546 of course the future careers of the three players was discussed it was canvassed
1358547 im not going to sit here and talk rubbish to you of course it was discussed
1358548 at the end of our playing campaign the three boys careers will be assessed again
1358549 could those players be traded yes we will review that at the end of the season but were not sitting down as a club right at the moment going who are we going to trade we dont do that until the end of the year
1358550 when you have two of your key players looking the president the coach and their own team mates in the eye and actually lying to them that really destroys the essence of the club
1358551 it was decided by the leadership group and the executive that these two players actually dont deserve to wear the collingwood football club jumper
1358552 we feel that the integrity of this football club and that the policies of honesty and integrity that we build the whole organisation on if thats robbed or taken away or diminished in any way shape or form then youre striking at the very essence or core of your existence you might as well turn the lights off and go home
1358553 i dont accept that at all but i do accept that people will be looking at the collingwood football club and asking questions
1358554 we have to get to him just as he gets the ball and put some pressure on him
1358555 it takes a pretty special player to do that hes one of those players where the alarm bells go off when he has the ball you dont know where hes going to pop up
1358556 hes got the fend from hell you see that thing coming at you i got put on my backside in the grand final by it
1358557 its not a pretty sight hes about seven foot tall with seven foot arms hes got a lot of strength behind him hes an awesome talent
1358558 just the way he runs and can push and beat a player his athletic ability
1358559 i have no doubt if he can continue doing that for another eight to 10 years he can be one of the greatest
1358560 his athletic ability is amazing his raw talent is freakish
1358561 when there are tight games hes the one they go to to make a difference
1358562 it was good to see a team not take a backward step
1358563 ive not seen any financial modelling of the proposed new provincial set up with south africa not in the frame
1358564 all i can tell you is that the present super 14 set up as in the domestic competition the air new zealand cup is under review
1358565 theres been lots of talk about a whole raft of proposed changes but nothing is set in concrete
1358566 i believe it is very premature to say that new zealand will field up to nine teams in any new expanded southern hemisphere series
1358567 my unions stated ambition is to play at the highest level but to say taranaki has been in talks in the planning of a new competition is simply not true
1358568 i feel great ive been training with the world record in mind in the 400m freestyle
1358569 its my understanding that park has said hes going to break the world record and if he does that it will be a very good result
1358570 the reason it has been such a good world record is that it was set by ian thorpe who is a phenomenal swimmer park has said that hell break it so well have to see how well he swims and what he can do
1358571 caroline fourest tord le coup lhypocrisie qui consiste nier que cette pr occupation de virginit de la femme de nos jours et dans notre pays est le fait des populations de culture musulmane
1358572 pour le reste je ne crois pas que la religion soit en cause cest plut t une question de culture de coutumes de tradit
1358573 il faudrait apprendre caroline quil y a encore une diff rence entre certaines associations catholiques qui incitent les jeunes des deux sexes qui le souhaitent rester vierges jusquau mariage et la religion musulmane qui exige que les femmes cr atures inf rieures selon le coran soient vierges au jour de mariage sinon cest le d shonneur et le fouet ou la lapidation dans les pays islamiques ce que la famille vite en recourant aux crimes dhonneur

1358673 under senator mccains plan the oil companies get billions more we dont pay any less at the pump and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis
1358674 the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1358675 the new plan is really just a lot of words warmed over
1358676 its easy to try to hide behind the words but the reality is barack obama is not leading on this issue
1358677 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1358678 i decided to break my silence to say that one is innocent until proven guilty my sister is innocent and has never been actually accused of any crime
1358679 we demand that aafias trial should not take place in guantanamo bay we demand that aafias relations be allowed immediate access to her
1358680 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime
1358681 we are receiving threats through phone calls and sms not to discuss or pursue aafias case i do not know who are the people threatening us
1358682 under senator mccains plan the oil companies get billions more we dont pay any less at the pump and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis

1358692 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1358693 what was given to solana was the telephone conversation transcript and not a response to the proposed package
1358694 given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy
1358695 in the absence of a positive response we have no choice but to pursue further measures
1358696 we can see clearly that these forces are trying to wage a psychological and violent battle against the olympics

1358720 its a virus he picked up in nigeria and its not a nice one but quite a few have had it its such a bad virus and hes got to be training to be fit
1358721 the players had malaria tablets and injections before we went to africa but wayne has come back and it has knocked him sideways
1358722 michael carrick has also had the virus but maybe he will get part of the game against portsmouth on sunday
1358723 its all been about injuries and viruses at the moment and im wondering if i am going to have a team to start the season apart from wayne nani is suspended and anderson is off to the olympics

1358731 they are trying to take away our freedom to party and i have come here to fight against it
1358732 the authorities think that partying is bad for society but we have a right to dance
1358733 people come here from all over the world to express themselves and celebrate life
1358734 without tolerance the world would be a much darker place
1358735 i own a ticketing outlet and flyer company but my business is suffering because the new laws have kept people away from the island this year
1358736 rather than put an end to afterparties theyve actually fueled the illegal party scene

1358738 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1358739 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1358740 the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services
1358741 and learn we will the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year

1358848 its really good to hear someone say something positive about the internet for a change the media is always harping on the dangers and they do exist but they never say anything good about it yet millions of people use it every day so there must be something good about it i agree its like any other tool it can be used for good or for bad
1358849 i most certainly do use the internet to check out new boyfriends and other people i meet i can often find out if they lied to me about themselves or maybe theyre lying on facebook or whatever but the stories dont match up thats whats important i never checked criminal history never knew how thank you for including that link i will now
1358850 thats a very difficult question i suppose to some extent it would depend what theyd found and more significantly perhaps what interpretation theyd put on it i dont think i have a criminal record well i have a lot of abba and some julie andrews sorry im wary of even checking on that though as i suspect curiosity would not be an acceptable answer to why did you want to know
1358851 i hope people do check me out if they do they probably dont mind that i check them out too when i meet somebody new i do business with i look for them on linkedin and invite them to join my network if i dont find them there i think maybe they arent as ambitious about networking with other professionals or maybe they arent very technically savvy anyway i have to say i have a better impression of them if i find them there it also lets me get to know things about them like where they work job histories what we might have in common
1358852 i would be put off if i found out someone i dated was checking me out online especially a criminal history search it shows a lack of trust level of suspicion that is not any way to start a relationship i can understand doing this if youre hiring somebody to take care of your kids or something like that thats business but not in a personal relationship

1358859 the process was a little weird because it was such a long drawn out process
1358860 the olympic selection took the better part of the year from about september of last year all the way until july
1358861 the thing with that is they gave me a penalty i dont think i had
1358862 i had two but they gave me a third one on the last gate i really didnt think i had it but they were pretty insistent about it without that i would have been in ninth after the semifinal which would have gotten me into the final then i could have gone anywhere for 10th to first
1358863 it was a little disappointing because of that extra touch i was pushed out of the finals in general it was a pretty good race because in training and then in the qualification races my runs were in the top boats for sure it was a very encouraging race despite the fact the result was not ideal

1358897 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1358898 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime

1358926 sitting in a bar and this good song came on the jukebox and i went over to check it out
1358927 people had a habit of looking at me as if i were some kind of mirror instead of a person they didnt see me they saw their own lewd thoughts then they white masked themselves by calling me the lewd one
1358928 i knew i belonged to the public and to the world not because i was talented or even beautiful but because i had never belonged to anything or anyone else

1358931 es ist die angst dass man als rassistisch und islamfeindlich angesehen wird

1358933 das grundst ck ist f r die kommune f r immer weg und das geld ist schnell ausgegeben
1358934 man sollte erst mal die planungen abwarten es sollen sicher keinen dominanten bauten entstehen

1358939 nat rlich kann man heute immer wieder durch den einsatz neuer maschinen in der stabbearbeitung beim schwei en und verputzen ein paar sekunden pro fenster herausholen aber es macht keinen sinn allein auf die taktzeit zu schauen
1358940 hier wird noch viel zeit und damit auch viel geld kaputt gemacht
1358941 in vielen betrieben werden rahmen und fl gel noch von hand ab und bereinander gestapelt wenns dann an die hochzeit geht muss der mitarbeiter erst wieder die passenden st cke zusammensuchen das kostet nerven zeit und geld
1358942 bei quasi allen anlagenplanungen und neuinvestitionen unserer kunden ist das verbesserungspotenzial in der logistik das beherrschende thema wir erhalten viele auftr ge dadurch weil wir f r die kunden individuelle anlagenkonzepte erarbeiten dabei muss teilweise gar nicht viel investiert werden manchmal reicht bereits eine kleine nderung in den bearbeitungsabl ufen aus um k nftig die kosten zu reduzieren zum beispiel kann man die schlie teile bereits am losen stab montieren also schon vor dem schwei vorgang das macht teilweise wirklich sinn und nutzt personalressourcen optimal aus
1358943 durch die verlagerung der beschlagsmontage und den ausgleichspuffer durch das abstapelregal von urban sparen wir wertvolle zeit
1358944 f r jeden kunden gibt es die richtige l sung bei der bestehende komponenten mit in die planung einbezogen und teilweise nur um ein paar details wie eine automatische transportbahn oder ein weiteres regal erg nzt werden m ssen schon kann der hersteller schneller und preiswerter fertigen
1358945 die abstapelung eignet sich hervorragend als zwischenpuffer vor der montage von rolll den k mpfern zusatzprofilen verbreiterungen oder bankanschl ssen aber auch als endpuffer vor der hochzeit von fl gel und rahmen macht die abstapelung sinn durch den einsatz von barcodescannern ist die abstapelung nicht an einen starren ablauf gebunden sondern absolut flexibel aufgrund des sicheren ein und ausscanvorgangs wei das system immer wo sich zu welcher zeit welcher fl gel und der passende rahmen dazu befinden auf knopfdruck werden die richtigen komponenten entsprechend zusammengef hrt
1358946 doch mittlerweile ist er quasi der status quo in der beschlagsbearbeitung
1358947 these ads are part of the bars branding the profession initiative launched in 2002 to educate the public about the value of attorneys

1358949 der koalitionsvertrag ist eindeutig es bleibt beim ausstieg aus der hochrisiko technologie atomkraft wenn das bundeswirtschaftsministerium an konzepten zum wiedereinstieg bastelt ist das nicht nur ein klarer versto gegen den koalitionsvertrag es zeigt vor allem dass im hause glos reiner atom lobbyismus betrieben wird eine zukunftsf hige energiepolitik muss aber auf die massive steigerung der energieeffizienz und auf erneuerbare energien setzen denn nur so k nnen die preissteigerungen f r die verbraucher ged mpft die versorgungssicherheit gew hrleistet und die klimaschutzziele der bundesregierung erreicht werden deutschland profitiert wie keine andere volkswirtschaft vom ausbau der erneuerbaren energien in der branche arbeiten schon heute 250 000 menschen umweltfreundliche energietechnik made in germany ist ein exportschlager bis 2020 wird die zahl der zukunftssicheren arbeitspl tze auf mindestens 500 000 steigen ein wirtschaftsminister der diesen boom abw rgen will hat den falschen beruf weltweit gibt es kein sicheres endlager f r den hochradioaktiven atomm ll zugleich verweigern hierzulande gerade die atomkraft bef rworter eine offene standortsuche wer l ngere laufzeiten will ohne ein sicheres endlager zu haben macht politik auf kosten nachfolgender generationen eine verl ngerung der laufzeiten alter atomkraftwerke w rde weder den benzin noch den strompreis senken sie w rde lediglich zu noch h heren gewinnen bei den vier gro en energieversorgern f hren ludwig erhard w rde sich im grabe umdrehen wenn er w sste dass sein amtsnachfolger ordnungspolitik mit lobbyismus verwechselt

1358961 the ministry with the support of the un food and agriculture organization fao has managed to obtain 2 6 million vaccines yet we require 15 million to vaccinate the entire sheep and goat population in the affected areas
1358962 we require technical personnel to be involved in the exercise that is expected to cover the entire northern kenya region it is expansive and expensive
1358963 we know that more goats are dying but the ministry is making all efforts to contain the situation
1358964 we have already approached some donors and i am optimistic they will help i am also hoping to get additional funding from the national disaster programme
1358965 so far the number of sheep and goats that have died since the viral disease was detected in turkana district in june 2006 stands at 2 7 million
1358966 our local traders and producers from the affected areas have been locked out of the market in kenya and abroad market prices have also fallen drastically as a result
1358967 we had an order for more than a half a million goats and sheep to be exported to the arab world before the end of the year but we cannot make it because of the poor health standards
1358968 i almost cried when i saw the goats dying in less than two days the only veterinary officer at the division was away and when he came back he told me that the goats died as a result of the disease
1358969 at the moment i have more than 80 goats but we are spending a lot of money to buy veterinary drugs

1358973 there are still people we havent made contact with there are still flooded homes that we cant get to we are still responding and at the same time we are trying to move into recovery as fast as we can
1358974 i know what its like once youre dealing with one disaster and another disaster happens and everybody forgets about the one before
1358975 a lot of these homes are in very impoverished areas so people have limited resources and will need a lot of additional support whether through case management or through other organizations
1358976 the crop loss in south texas is huge and the economic impact that its going to have on many of the families we deal with is something that were going to have to look at long term
1358977 everyone who is down here and is responding to this including the governor texas gov rick perry on todays conference call is applauding the wonderful interfaith interagency response at all levels
1358978 the spirit of cooperation is truly being felt in many many places god is clearly at work but there is a lot of work yet to do
1358979 there was water in their homes there was water up to their knees from their home to the road they were walking around in the water it was contaminated water a lot of people are fearful to go other places and they dont want to leave their homes
1358980 what are going to be the health ramifications of this
1358981 a few weeks down the line what are we going to find out the mosquitoes are horrendous and people are wading in contaminated water its kind of scary to think what may come from that
1358982 it will probably be months that well be working with families to help them develop a recovery plan and work through what they need
1358983 theres a large population here that will need additional support services for months to come
1358984 i think the cleanup will go on for several more weeks and then well move toward long term recovery
1358985 the people are down here but we dont have a handle on the assessments yet

1358993 we are taking the steps necessary to adjust our business plan to the realities of difficult current economic and financial market conditions

1358995 i still remember the dressing room atmosphere after our third defeat in the icc wcl div 1 in nairobi and we wanted to avoid that situation this time kenya is always a tough opponent but we played really well to win the semi final
1358996 i think the conditions for batting are slightly difficult and even though we have depth in our batting we have struggled to win our matches convincingly despite chasing small totals but we are improving and i am sure we will arrive in england next year as a much improved side

1359002 we have a lot of wind and rain right now
1359003 of course we always feel very fortunate when we dont get a direct hit galveston is used to tropical storms fortunately this did not become a hurricane

1359007 addiction to oil is one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1359008 you wont hear me say this too often but i couldnt agree more with the explanation that sen
1359009 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1359010 to do this we will invest 150 billion over the next decade and leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy that harnesses american energy and creates 5 million new american jobs
1359011 so there is a real choice in this election a choice about what kind of future we want for this country and this planet
1359012 misguided policies would result in higher energy costs to american families and businesses and increase dependence on foreign oil
1359013 we have to drill here and drill now not wait and see whether theres areas to explore not wait and see whether theres a package that needs to be put together but drill here and drill now

1359020 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1359021 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1359022 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1359023 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1359024 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1359025 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1359026 there are things we need to go through and from that conversation we will move forward

1359045 pentagon oks over 10 billion in arms sales for iraq
1359046 two thirds of the raw sewage produced in the capital flows untreated into rivers and waterway
1359047 pictures of ronald reagan you can debate whether ronald reagan was good or bad but the point is everything he said he stood for is being put to the sword by george bush but i wont even have that debate with you george bush is a puppet i refuse to live in this false reality with you the country is dying weve been de industrialized weve been strip mined politically economically and spiritually
1359048 i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan

1359055 i will not go away i will not turn off the camera we are in public are you worried perhaps about the criminal liability of being a partner to mass murder after the fact you know that is a real concern because the truth is coming out

1359057 taliban fighters are guilty of nothing but standing in defense of the innocent victims of 911
1359058 the taliban may have been a lot of things but they werent corrupt
1359059 as nazi tanks crossed into poland in 1939 an american senator declared lord if only i could have talked to hitler all of this might have been avoided we have an obligation to call this what it is the false comfort of appeasement which has been repeatedly discredited by history

1359065 zionists believe israel should not be defended from war criminals who bomb jewish communities indiscriminately to murder children with millions of landmines
1359066 you could almost see their dicks getting hard as they got new ideas
1359067 this barbarous act has no place among civilized peoples and shocks the conscience of all peace loving nations there is no cause that could ever justify this action
1359068 the politicians that we vote for wont stay and fight and they wont count the votes
1359069 the world should respect any action taken by ungodly zionist evil israel in order to defend its citizens
1359070 i grabbed her little sister and put her in front of me as the bullets began to fly the blood sprayed from between her eyes and then i laughed maniacally
1359071 the mass murdered unarmed innocent neighbors back door was open
1359072 it amounts to collective punishment and is contrary to international humanitarian law
1359073 more than 250 torture victims come forward to sue caci
1359074 our government has no power except that granted it by the people
1359075 the pentagon is seeking executions of innocent torture victims who allege they did every last terrorist act of the last 50 years

1359079 he claims to be a follower of the torah of moses but as far as i know the torah prohibits oppression and prohibits injustice and prohibits stealing peoples land and property
1359080 the attack will be spectacular and designed to inflict mass casualties against u s facilities or interests attack preparations have been made attack will occur with little or no warning
1359081 anything that moves you kill and dont take any prisoners
1359082 if the defense version of events is true dismissal of the charge is justified
1359083 lance corporal tatum entered a home and participated in the killing of iraqis who were not legitimate targets then entered a second home and participated in the murder of more innocent women and children
1359084 the marines have landed and we now as enron own a piece of afghanistan
1359085 it is not george bush it is not the neocons
1359086 these are the people who have overthrown elected governments all over the world and he richard perle comes on your program to prattle about democracy
1359087 i just want to point out that were going to encourage the people to look at the evidence for themselves

1359096 the results of our survey clearly point out trends in the market we were seeing across our customer base
1359097 todays data center needs to always be responsive to business demands and as this survey indicates senior it people are becoming more aware of the business strategies needed to make this happen
1359098 with the cube c 5r you can now have an extremely high end environment ready to go in under 2 hours for deployment in the field air or sea
1359099 i was intimately involved with the development of this solution and i can tell you the cube is truly a remarkable technology
1359100 the original customer was very pleased with its performance and i dont believe there is a product on the market that comes close to the computing power and performance in such a small green portable package
1359101 take advantage of significantly more compact lenses particularly in the wide angle and high power zoom range
1359102 good recording keeping is vital to ensuring that public funds are spent legally and appropriately
1359103 uses the weakness the helplessness of the palestinian patients in gaza in trying to pressure them to be collaborators
1359104 then they start to be about relatives people in the street people in the neighborhood then hes asked about power structures within military organizations in the gaza strip
1359105 if you want to go to the hospital take my private cellphone number talk to me and give me information about people
1359106 were not talking about a friendly neighbor at the moment and there are numerous cases of those who present security threats
1359107 the government has documented at least 20 cases of palestinians who tried to abuse their medical access to carry out terrorist attacks
1359108 israeli authorities halted the process however as they received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
1359109 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
1359110 my opponent wants to set a date to come home i want us to come home with victory and honor so we will never go back again
1359111 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1359112 id like to thank all of you for your support of our troops and heres why im many things in my life and one thing id like to be is your first lady but more importantly im jack mccains mother and jimmy mccains mother one in the u s navy and another one in the marine corps an iraqi vet
1359113 i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as both the first lady and miss buffalo chip
1359114 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1359115 ive just been relying on my fastball and my curveball pretty much and using my other two pitches every once in a while
1359116 in the first inning he got a good fastball up and away and he pounded it to right its not easy to play on the road thats pretty good
1359117 were close friends off the field ill talk to him tonight
1359118 he was able to foul off some pretty good pitches and i got him
1359119 the last one was up and off the plate a little and i swung through it
1359120 he started throwing his breaking ball and he had enough on his fastball he made some pretty good pitches
1359121 i kind of sat back on it and pena was aggressive it fell in that little spot where we both wanted to make that last out and we should have talked more but soria came up big at the end
1359122 they were swinging at a lot of pitches up in the zone and luckily thats kind of where my release point was today and i got away with it
1359123 its a shame when we have all these economic problems that the same people who cant afford to pay for their homes are willing to dash to the newsstands and feed the frenzy that causes magazine editors to spend millions
1359124 its a reflection of the appetite for seeing the children of celebs and also our big interest in judging other mothers
1359125 we are delighted that all proceeds from these stunning images will once again be donated entirely to charity through the jolie pitt foundation
1359126 its either the biggest photo victory ever or the biggest black eye on the journalism business you could imagine
1359127 i used to say its a gamble but now i think its a sure bet they will make it all back maybe not in a specific issue but in free publicity and promotion from the articles even negative ones that will be written about them
1359128 anyone who thinks that will stop the stalkerazzi theyre wrong it didnt work in the old days and it doesnt work now no matter how much money is out there
1359129 in our business there are almost no rules so the fact that the stars are turning the business on its head is probably a natural progression
1359130 the women who read our blog especially the new mothers they feel a connection to these celebrities as if they were family members so theres a natural inclination to want to see the baby pictures of someone you care about
1359131 if a practice is wrong it doesnt matter what the consequences are
1359132 sharing baby photos with family and friends is one thing but having these images put on magazines and on the internet forever is a different story
1359133 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
1359134 the american voter likes the underdog and my guess is that mccain is scoring branding points simply by not appearing inevitable and fighting on no matter what the odds
1359135 if barack obama wants to portray himself as someone who can unite people and bridge divides he needs clinton supporters it s hard to sustain the image of a uniter if you ve fractured your own party
1359136 it would be counterproductive for me to talk about it
1359137 i never was mad at senator obama i think everybodys got a right to run for president who qualifies under the constitution
1359138 id be the last person to ever begrudge anybody their ambition hes a superbly gifted candidate in this and had a great operation
1359139 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year
1359140 he clearly can inspire and motivate people and energize them which is a very important part of being president and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
1359141 we lost in vietnam because we lost our will to fight
1359142 those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
1359143 the golden boy will turn to dross and in november another loss
1359144 so i ll spare the candor twenty years from now you will not be missed grow up and vote the lesser of two evils
1359145 hi im barack obama and im running for president of the united states remember to vote for me in november and if you dont think im funny youve obviously never seen me bowl
1359146 im not going to deliver this line any better than that
1359147 im john mccain and i approve this message a president has to be funny they just have to be
1359148 unfunny presidents only serve one term if they win an election at all
1359149 i may not be the last comic standing but im definitely the funniest candidate for president
1359150 even as we keep working globally we need to do much more to fight aids at home and i intend to do so with my foundation
1359151 this product fusion will be released on april 12 2010 at 200 per unit volume of 1000 plus
1359152 rnl bio is commencing its worldwide services with booger as its first successful clone
1359153 the most unusual thing about booger was that he has a unique ability to reason
1359154 ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs that mr ledger consumed
1359155 for some men its a tough issue to face said dr
1359156 it isnt that we know when youre going to die or that its all over so dont worry about anything else
1359157 even before this we were really trying to recommend to physicians that given the uncertainty about benefit for screening you should really discuss on an individual basis the pros and cons of screening dr
1359158 what we find in practice is that adds additional time and effort thats not compensated as part of normal clinical care its easier to just draw the blood test i think what we hope now is that it will be just as easy to not do the blood test
1359159 well perhaps the 75 year old wants to know if he has prostate cancer not because hes planning treatment but well to just know
1359160 and treatment of prostate cancer has significant drawbacks often leading to impotence incontinence and a variety of other complications that reduce a patient s quality of life
1359161 would have been a serious life threat within a year
1359162 how many womens hospitals are there in the us alone
1359163 the chances are more that screening is going to harm you
1359164 the chances are more that screening is going to harm you
1359165 that it will free up resources by not giving the test to older men
1359166 i dont know why for some reason theyre just sticking it to me this year i applaud the move any time you get a chance to get manny ramirez you get him but from a personal standpoint its putting me in a tough position
1359167 you have to believe when andruw starts hitting ill probably be back on the bench if he strings together two to three good games everyone knows im not selfish but its a difficult spot they continue to put me in throughout the whole year
1359168 juan for me will play the bulk of the time
1359169 at this point in time his experience his consistency the way he goes about his business when rafael furcal went down hes meant so much to the club he brings another dimension his basestealing ability he gives a professional at bat on a regular basis hes done it leading off longer than matt hes willing to take pitches
1359170 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating

1359181 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1359182 one of the reasons im going is because i want to show respect to the chinese people and this is a proud moment for china

1359184 the internet provides interesting opportunities for people to express themselves sometimes its open sometimes the filters are there ive talked to the evangelicals who go there who feel like the underground church movement has gotten a few steps forward a step and a half back its really hard to tell
1359185 in terms of effectiveness the so called quiet behind the scenes diplomacy so far is a failure
1359186 on the human rights front as we approach the olympics china really has the worst record and is deteriorating up until today
1359187 the lesson of the ep3 was that its really important to be in a position to have quick communications with a nation as large and as important as china
1359188 they have tested they havent just defied the united states theyve defied you too china
1359189 thats to be seen but i know that theres a structure in place that will make it more likely they will because not only do you have the united states speaking out now you have china speaking out

1359342 did the united states help iraq to acquire the building blocks of biological weapons during the iran iraq war
1359343 i have never heard anything like what youve read i have no knowledge of it whatsoever and i doubt it
1359344 these exported biological materials were not attenuated or weakened and were capable of reproduction
1359345 it was later learned that these microorganisms exported by the united states were identical to those the united nations inspectors found and recovered from the iraqi biological warfare program
1359346 normal relations between the united states and iraq would serve our longer term interests and promote stability in both the gulf and the middle east the united states government should propose economic and political incentives for iraq to moderate its behavior and to increase our influence with iraq

1359355 what have i given to coca cola my loyalty and my love i give that
1359356 this used to be a good job once but over the years it has changed
1359357 we have exchanged our benefits for wage increases over the years so we have paid for our own wage increases

1359363 at all times had regard to the requirements of the oecd anti bribery convention
1359364 the decision to halt the investigation was not the governments but that of the director of the sfo
1359365 we are genuinely shocked that the government was prepared to breach international law to terminate the inquiry it is clear the uk government has been telling the uk courts one thing and the oecd a completely different story
1359366 the message that a chiquita like case sends to other companies is that its really easy to see and quantify the downside but not so much the upside

1359372 after much campaigning on the issue since the cases of iranian lgbt asylum seekers pegah emembakhsh and mehdi kazemi came to light we have got clearance from the web team on the prime ministers website for our petition
1359373 we now challenge the government to start treating lgbt asylum seekers with the fairness that they deserve these are people whove often fled persecution rape and torture who flee to our country and our response is to lock them up like criminals we say enough is enough of this inhumane policy we need to stick our necks out now and stand up for lgbt asylum seekers
1359374 frankly i agree with you we dont need it socpa weve got enough paperwork as it is why do we need more i support what your doing
1359375 how can we find our way out of this labyrinth of madness

1359391 as a leading journalist and broadcaster john brings the vision and leadership skills needed to place index at the centre of the debate surrounding freedom of expression and champion this vital human right nationally and globally

1359393 whilst the developers have attempted to consider the needs of local residents i certainly feel that many concerns need to be addressed before the plans go any further
1359394 the frome road already busy at peak times such as school drop off and pick up would only be added to with the arrival of a supermarket
1359395 there also needs to be more consultation over whether or not local residents need a sports centre the university is not too far and nor is culverhay school both of which have excellent sports facilities furthermore there is still no consensus over who would manage the centre
1359396 finally b amp nes council and somer housing should be contacted to see if there is any need for the sheltered housing in the proposal
1359397 i think the introduction of the minimum wage is one of labours proudest achievements in government
1359398 the government have built on this by increasing the minimum wage and bringing in better safeguards at work like paid holidays and the right to request flexible working for parents and carers
1359399 there are penalties for employers who dont pay workers the minimum wage and even tougher measures are to be introduced to tackle rogue employers as part of the employment bill now before parliament

1359403 hinton st george have shown what an organised and determined community can achieve and they will be an inspiration to towns and villages across the country
1359404 when families are struggling with rising fuel energy and food prices it is more important than ever that there is a basic floor of decency underpinning the labour market
1359405 i became an mp to fight for the rights of working people in erith and thamesmead looking back i think the minimum wage is one of labours proudest achievements in government
1359406 the next step is the recent announcement that the government intends to change the current minimum wage rules on tipping to ensure that in the future tips will be additional to the minimum wage
1359407 dealing with this is a matter of fairness and common sense when we go to a restaurant or to have our haircut and we leave a tip we expect it to go to the staff member in addition to their pay not to go through the payroll to make up the minimum wage
1359408 this move will benefit workers in service industries throughout erith and thamesmead people we all rely on but who often dont have the strongest voice
1359409 abbiamo tanti motivi per essere felici prima di tutto siamo vivi

1359416 resulta deplorable que lo que hayamos escuchado hasta el momento del gobierno de canarias es un recital de los argumentos victimistas y bananeros agotados pero de costumbre del gobierno que padecemos en canarias
1359417 no es verdad el argumento es cuantitativo tiene que ver con el volumen de tr fico y se ir ampliando
1359418 sea capaz de concitar un grado de consenso constitucional tambi n con los cabildos y con el gobierno de la naci n con un talante positivo y argumentos convincentes y no con el recurso manido de agravio comparativo que no va a ninguna parte y nadie se cree
1359419 est cumpliendo su programa electoral al modificar el modelo hist ricamente heredado de gesti n de los aeropuertos
1359420 para ello la ministra de fomento ha dicho que tiene un plan que es dividir a aena en dos secciones una destinada a la navegaci n a rea y otra a la gesti n de los aeropuertos en la que va a dar cauce a la participaci n del capital privado hasta un 30 y otros entes p blicos territoriales las comunidades aut nomas en principio que podr participar con el estado en el restante 70 por ciento detentando el estado siempre la parte mayoritaria

1359434 when we come out of church talking about how holy god is instead of how we feel or
1359435 there were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime endlessness when terror was so strong in me that i could feel idiocy replace reason
1359436 let me say this ive never been more nervous on the field in my life
1359437 growing up in texas you see those kinds of storms all the time you learn that lightning is nothing to fool around with
1359438 ill stand out there in the rainstorm all day long but thunder and lightning in that kind of proximity its definitely a hazard you have to get the fans out of there we have to be out there but if you give those fans a reason to hang around they will
1359439 if they had continued the game i wouldnt have gone back out there not for a while
1359440 like i said before the inning you have to be an idiot to stand outside during a lightning storm thats just common sense
1359441 when the last one hit it was too close even for us and i pulled them off i would never put any team or player or umpire in harms way
1359442 this time of year with the playoffs and teams in contention we know its tough
1359443 i dont really want to be here at midnight but thats our job thats what you do when the second rain came it just wasnt going to happen we talked to everybody and then called the game
1359444 it was pretty crazy lightning and tornado sirens going off the weather was pretty nuts
1359445 actually it looked like somebody stood above the stadium with a ziplock bag full of water and opened it up it really did you could barely even see right field
1359446 dell is unmatched as a high volume supplier but its business model doesnt work as well when it can only achieve low sales volumes
1359447 the path to a new financial market architecture however uneven and improvised will not only be marked by the forces of retrenchment the path should equally be distinguished by the creative impulses that drive product and market innovation it is perhaps too convenient to denigrate the attributes of ingenuity when the forces of innovation can disappoint and weaken the real economy policymakers and market participants alike should recognize that innovation in our product markets labor markets and yes our financial markets is likely to prove a necessary net contributor to economic growth in the coming period we should also be reminded that financial innovation need not be equated with product complexity
1359448 newly issued covered bonds backed by high quality mortgage loans and issued by strong financial institutions may find a growing investor base in the united states

1359450 myself marcus and chanel were young facilitators for the workshop we worked with a group of professional adults to produce a pod cast about what they thought was important to young people the adults said that they had gained something from our workshop which was actually knowing what was important to young people as a young person i felt the workshop went really well and that young people may now have the confidence to speak up and discuss their passion for media without feeling as if they are being judged by a professional

1359456 que contar con un verdadero hospital de segundo nivel y que albergar distintas especialidades m dicas
1359457 gracias a la gesti n desarrollada por el partido popular el norte tendr un hospital de calidad con salas de consulta y exploraciones para m s de 15 especialidades m dicas y quir rgicas con una extensi n de 12 000 metros y con una financiaci n de casi 32 millones de euros financiado exclusivamente por la comunidad aut noma y el cabildo de tenerife
1359458 nuestra apuesta m s destacada es la mejora de los servicios y comunicaciones que reciben estos vecinos que no por estar lejos del rea metropolitana tienen que estar apeados del desarrollo
1359459 trabajar en todas las instituciones en las que tenemos representaci n para conseguir todos los beneficios para esta comarca
1359460 pondremos todo nuestro empe o en conseguir que tanto el anillo insular el tren del norte como la l nea mar tima puerto de la cruz y la palma tres elementos claves para el progreso y cohesi n de esta comarca sean una realidad porque estamos seguros y as lo hemos defendido siempre que el desarrollo de buenas infraestructuras aumentan la calidad de vida de nuestros ciudadanos generan riqueza y originan m s empleo algo necesario frente a la actual situaci n econ mica y la pasividad del gobierno del psoe
1359461 queremos para el noroeste mejoras conexiones y m s accesibles as como un medio de transporte colectivo que ahorre a los vecinos costosos y dif ciles desplazamientos de m s de dos horas al d a algo que no parece importarle al psoe que sigue neg ndose al progreso y a mejoras para los tinerfe os con su negativa a financiar obras importantes para tenerife como los trenes del norte y del sur
1359462 parece que al gobierno socialista no le importa el atraso en infraestructuras que sufre esta isla desde que ellos gobiernan espa a un hecho que influye directamente en la econom a insular ya que una cola en la autopista cuesta dinero y salud a los conductores y se ha estimado que el coste de los colapsos de tr fico se sit a en un 2 por ciento del producto interior bruto para los pa ses desarrollados
1359463 este dato sumado a los m s de 97 millones de euros que el gobierno central nos debe en materia sanitaria da buena cuenta de todo los que los tinerfe os pod amos poseer y no tenemos por una p sima gesti n del ejecutivo y un poco compromiso con canarias en general y con tenerife en particular
1359464 estas citas nos permiten conocer cu les son las necesidades reales tanto de los municipios como de la comarca y nos permiten trasladarlas a nuestros compa eros presentes en el resto de las instituciones

1359551 i dont recall such a massive bandh in recent years
1359552 each death only makes us more determined we are not going to be bullied by the valley any more jammu wants a voice of its own jammus hindus will no longer tolerate oppression by kashmirs muslims
1359553 mr vohra did neither he only added fuel to the fire by telling some people who went to plead with him why should i bother about jammu does jammu matter does jammu exist he has been insensitive and his actions have only served to provoke the protesters
1359554 years of neglect of jammu by kashmir has resulted in what you are seeing today the people are frustrated the pandits have at last found a platform to vent their anger jammu has more people than kashmir but the lions share always goes to the valley
1359555 clearly underestimated the determination of jammus long suffering hindus who have had to cope with denial and deprivation for decades as the state government focuses only on the kashmir valley
1359556 it was his way of registering his protest against mr omar abdullahs speech in parliament he was incensed by the national conference leaders duplicity
1359557 tried to cremate it using old tyres kerosene oil and liquor
1359558 there is a great deal of anger among the people of jammu even the army seems to be unable to contain the anger of the people
1359559 the government should realise that this is not going to end and while we have appealed for peace the government and administration need to take some real steps to address the issues raised in jammu

1359606 det er absolutt ikke noe som skulle tilsi at h ndkommunion er en uting rent historisk er man da ogs p sikker grunn da den f rste kommunion ganske sikkert var en form for h ndkommunion men som alltid n r det gjelder messen gjelder at kommunionen skal skje med verdighet at legfolk kan v re med utdele komunnion ser jeg heller ikke noen problemer med tvert imot kan det p en fin m te illustrere det allmenne prested mme sml 1 pet 2 5 9 p 1 6
1359607 det er absolutt ikke noe som skulle tilsi at h ndkommunion er en uting
1359608 one receives in the mouth what one believes by faith
1359609 it is prohibited for the faithful to even touch the sacred vessels or receive in the hand
1359610 you who are wont to assist at the divine mysteries know how when you receive the body of the lord you take reverent care lest any particle of it should fall to the ground and a portion of the consecrated gift consecrati muneris escape you you consider it a crime and rightly so if any particle thereof fell down through negligence
1359611 to omit nothing doctrinal on so important a subject we now come to speak of the minister of the sacrament a point however on which scarcely anyone is ignorant the pastor then will teach that to priests alone has been given power to consecrate and administer the holy eucharist that the unvarying practice of the church has also been that the faithful receive the sacrament from the hand of the priest and that the priest communicate himself has been explained by the council of trent and the same holy council has shown that this practice is always to be scrupulously adhered to stamped as it is with the authoritative impress of apostolic tradition and sanctioned by the illustrious example of our lord himself who with his own hands consecrated and gave to his disciples his most sacred body to consult as much as possible for the dignity of this so august a sacrament not only is its administration confided exclusively to the priestly order but the church has also by an express law prohibited any but those who are consecrated to religion unless in case of necessity to touch the sacred vessels the linen or other immediate necessaries for consecration priest and people may hence learn what piety and holiness they should possess who consecrate administer or receive the holy of holies
1359612 it communion in the hand carries certain dangers with it which may arise from the new manner of administering holy communion the danger of a loss of reverence for the august sacrament of the altar of profanation of adulterating the true doctrine
1359613 behind communion in the hand i wish to repeat and make as plain as i can is a weakening a conscious deliberate weakening of faith in the real presence
1359614 the best way to administer communion is on the tongue
1359615 jeg fant en liten lapp i kirken i dag hvor det sto
1359616 our blessed mother tells you our holy father asks you not to take holy communion on your hand please do not stand in the present of your god
1359617 i believe we should immediately give every working family in america a 1 000 energy rebate and we should pay for it with part of the record profits that the oil companies are making right now
1359618 we were out running errands and got hungry but you got to eat pepperoni pizza at school today and you love pepperoni pizza

1359620 you tried to tell me its his fault because hes down and letting loose this homicide all over the town ill take your number ill write it down whats your address ill write it down ill be in touch so dont leave town in a big black car
1359621 too much of something is bad enough too much of something is just as tough
1359622 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
1359623 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
1359624 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
1359625 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
1359626 we allowed for 25 percent this will be substantially more than that our average cost for diesel fuel in 2007 was 2 38 a gallon our most recent purchase was 4 09
1359627 theres no doubt in my mind that what senator obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something

1359630 people in at least 14 villages will be adversely affected by the construction including the vibration and noise from the explosions and the release of chemical substances in natural water sources and soil pianporn said
1359631 i do not understand why prime minister samak wanted to dust off the water diversion project despite the fact that it has yet to be approved by the national environmental committee first pianporn added
1359632 who will benefit from the proposed water diversion projects are they the people or the politicians said lertsak
1359633 peoples participation in any decision making is also required for such megaprojects as it could have an immense impact on their lives
1359634 foyt everybody had the greatest regard for him he looked like joe college when you met him but when he got on the track he was a driver

1359637 zipadelli called taylor weld who was working at the company an hour later
1359638 it takes massive quantities of oil to produce plastic water bottles and to ship them in diesel trucks across the united states
1359639 nestle will face swift legal challenge if it does not fully evaluate the environmental impact of diverting millions of gallons of spring water from the mccloud river into billions of plastic water bottles
1359640 nestle waters is committed to ensuring that our projects are consistent with the sustainability and long term availability of water in the communities in which we are located
1359641 we are excited to get this important work started to help us better understand the watershed the combination of north state resources understanding and expertise in northern california with the knowledge of some of california s leading scientists from the university of california will result in the development of valuable data that will benefit the mccloud community for years to come
1359642 fails to address in any meaningful way the projects likely environmental impacts
1359643 the deir fails to analyze the global warming impacts of the project even though bouling and transporting water are highly energy intensive
1359644 nor does the deir adequately examine the impacts of the project on air quality water quality of the mccloud river and its tributaries biological resources or solid waste
1359645 the environmental review for the previously proposed project had serious deficiencies
1359646 the suggested changes would require significant revision of the contract between nestle and the mccloud community services district a new formal project proposal and circulation of a new draft environmental impact report
1359647 the forest service would be on its knees except for the money congress provides
1359648 this thing is pretty close to being out of control
1359649 the forest service bases its budget for forest fires on wishful thinking its a constant juggling act and thats not the way it should be done
1359650 we usually see something like this in late august or september
1359651 until someone comes up with a better system this is what we have this is what congress gave us
1359652 as we treat more acres our firefighting costs go down
1359653 but we are only one third of the way to where we need to be and it will probably take a decade to finish

1359660 the governor has violated the sasb act he cannot act unilaterally any decision of the board has to be endorsed by at least five members
1359661 he is also in contempt of the high court which had passed an interim order approving the transfer of 800 kanals of land to the board in baltal
1359662 i dont recall such a massive bandh in recent years
1359663 each death only makes us more determined we are not going to be bullied by the valley any more jammu wants a voice of its own jammus hindus will no longer tolerate oppression by kashmirs muslims
1359664 mr vohra did neither he only added fuel to the fire by telling some people who went to plead with him why should i bother about jammu does jammu matter does jammu exist he has been insensitive and his actions have only served to provoke the protesters
1359665 years of neglect of jammu by kashmir has resulted in what you are seeing today the people are frustrated the pandits have at last found a platform to vent their anger jammu has more people than kashmir but the lions share always goes to the valley
1359666 clearly underestimated the determination of jammus long suffering hindus who have had to cope with denial and deprivation for decades as the state government focuses only on the kashmir valley
1359667 it was his way of registering his protest against mr omar abdullahs speech in parliament he was incensed by the national conference leaders duplicity

1359740 the white house had concocted a fake letter from the director of the iraqi intelligence service to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1359741 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1359742 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion

1359827 er staat een filmpje op youtube waarin erol alkan hem draait hij klinkt episch zo vet en hard we hadden nog bedacht zijn kleedkamer in te sneaken maar hij draait pas een dag na ons joost van bellen zal hem misschien ook hebben als hij niet lekt zullen we het moeten doen met het origineel
1359828 niet zo origineel om die te noemen maar wat een te gekke hit ongelofelijk ik draai op veel verschillende avonden en dat nummer werkt altijd kennelijk heeft een heel breed publiek besloten dat het een te gek nummer is
1359829 misschien heeft het ermee te maken dat de creatieve britse hausse duidelijk voorbij is mensen moeten nu zoeken naar een goed popliedje terwijl in de tijd tussen franz ferdinand en arctic monkeys heel veel goeds uitkwam misschien valt zon nummer daardoor beter op
1359830 je draait nooit twee keer hetzelfde nummer ik heb wel ooit zeven nummers van radioheads ok computer gedraaid toen die plaat net uit was daar hebben mensen het nog steeds over

1359846 ill just lay this out right from the beginning mandriva spring 2008 live cd is better than most other distributions fully installed
1359847 the main concept is that linux distributions and open source in general have a lot to gain by synchronizing their working with shortcuts in linux ubuntu
1359848 when you install an application in most cases it will show up somewhere in the menu sometimes the location seems to be a bit arbitrary the linux file system
1359849 in my last article i talked about working with shortcuts in ubuntu linux in this article i want to explain the basics of the linux file wireless n networking and linux

1359877 in most cases we found that the parent or other adult responsible for supervising the child simply was not present when the injury occurred
1359878 young children need nearly constant supervision and of course thats not always possible but it should be the parents highest priority many infants died because parents placed them in an unsafe sleep environment parents may not be aware of whats safe and what isnt especially with so much new information being released about safe sleeping environments for infants in other cases parents failed to use mandated safety devices such as car seats or the adult was present when the injury occurred but could not protect the child because they were under the influence of drugs or alcohol
1359879 what we know is that these injuries can be prevented
1359880 the importance of intervention is huge recognizing at risk families can help care providers take proper action nurses and other health care providers often encounter families with young children but there isnt enough time to address all aspects of child care with every single family care providers can use these findings to identify high risk families and provide them with specific information or referrals

1359884 we are attempting to assess the chemicals and minerals that make up the soil composition we are now about half way through the process and there are several conflicting points of view this is not a good time to go public with half the story
1359885 we are committed to following a rigorous scientific process while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results initial meca analyses suggested earth like soil further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry
1359886 the reason that all this seems so hush hush is due to a future paper and press release that appears likely to pop out of the american association for the advancement of science aaas and its science magazine whatever the poop is from the scoop thats been studied by phoenix that information is purportedly going through peer review

1359960 in the past few years many women who are well educated and trained for career tracks have decided instead to stay at home
1359961 it says we make enough money that we both dont need to work outside the home
1359962 and especially with the recent economic pressures a stay at home spouse is often an extreme and visible luxury
1359963 i go grocery shopping on wednesdays and clean house on thursdays
1359964 if you told me years ago that i was going to be a stay at home wife i would have laughed at you
1359965 i was able to clip coupons do all the chores and make nice dinners
1359966 i thought about the feminist movement all those women who worked so hard so that i could go out and have a good career and i was kind of saying no thanks
1359967 but i dont see what good it would do to work in a job that i couldnt stand and if i have the choice not to why wouldnt i take that opportunity
1359968 everyone seems to be ok with women staying home when they have kids
1359969 ive actually heard people say that women who dont work are a drain on society
1359970 many women i talk to take care of the household seriously and they want to focus on caring for the home whether or not it involves children
1359971 i hear frustration from men whose wives choose not to work
1359972 but only if there are financial stresses one of the realities is that few men appreciate the scope and difficulties of managing a household
1359973 when catherine stays at home i feel the house is more together because she has the time to do things like in depth cleaning and can be more attentive to the garden
1359974 she also has more time to find good deals at secondhand stores garage sales and at grocery stores
1359975 i dont believe that the woman has to be the exclusive cook cleaner or shopper and i dont believe the man must be the breadwinner i wouldnt mind staying at home while catherine works

1359977 now is the time for a real debate on the future of public sector sports broadcasting which i know is under consideration and under review
1359978 all these 19 million people interested in cricket buy tv licences and surely they should have a right to expect that the public sector broadcasters mount bids for the nations summer sport
1359979 the bbc is astonished at the comments from the ecb
1359980 we have always said that any bid for live test cricket is subject to value for money and ability to schedule in our view neither of these criteria were met
1359981 we have consistently argued that not having cricket as a listed event puts it out of reach of all terrestrial broadcasters this is the ecbs choice and they are entitled to it it is absurd to blame the bbc for this outcome
1359982 a bidder may bid for part only of any package eg two test matches or whatever taking place in each season however any such bid must be for the full duration of the contract
1359983 we had countless meetings with broadcasters and i am convinced that we now have achieved the best deal available to cricket from those companies who expressed an interest in the rights
1359984 this trend is continuing due to the relative high costs and risks of leasing compared to traditional cash and apr discount financing business
1359985 chrysler gm and ford are going to make leasing so expensive the wise person will avoid it
1359986 only bill gates doesnt have to worry if the monthly payment is 2 000 rather than 200
1359987 you can always lease from others but those others are now saying this is a bad game and we need to change the rules we need to lower residual values on vehicles that get low mileage and charge more on those vehicles with low residual values
1359988 leasing was initially sold on the basis that it was better to tie up someone elses money on a depreciating asset rather than tie up your own but when you tie up someone elses money you still have to pay for it
1359989 its a lesser of two evils thing lose volume by not leasing or lose money by leasing at too low residual values
1359990 the big appeal of leasing was the low monthly payment but now manufacturers are correcting that
1359991 leasing is going to get more expensive and the risk is being transferred to the customer in the past automakers subsidized leases you wont see banks who offer leases doing that
1359992 dealers who rely on leasing will find ways to lease other than the auto finance companies
1359993 but it will be tougher to find a willing finance company in fact independents are welcoming this automaker drop out because theyve been squeezed by subsidized or subvented leases now they can charge what they have to and know they arent going to be undercut by gmac or chrysler
1359994 consumers are going to pay more for a lease because the economy has made it riskier to provide a lease
1359995 consumers became used to leasing to get into a large or luxury car they otherwise couldnt afford but if the consumer wants the same low monthly payment in the future hes going to have to lease less car with less features
1359996 this is why i think leasing will go back as the method for businessmen and those who get lots of tax write offs on their cars for business expenses to obtain their vehicles rather than by those who use it to obtain a car for personal use
1359997 if you buy youre going to have to stretch the loan to five to seven years to get the same low monthly payment you got when leasing three to four years and that means after three to four years youll still owe more than the car is worth
1359998 putting someone into a six or seven year finance contract guarantees they wont return to market for five or six years
1359999 a three year lease guarantees theyll come back in three years which gives them the opportunity to sell or lease another vehicle to that customer dealers like it because they know what vehicles are coming back and that allows them to pre sell an off lease car to someone else
